{"iliad": "The Iliad\nBy Homer\n\n\nTranslated by Samuel Butler\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK I\n\nSing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought\ncountless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying\ndown to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures,\nfor so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the\nson of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with\none another. \n\nAnd which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the\nson of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence\nupon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had\ndishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships\nof the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great\nransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed\nwith a suppliant's wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but most of\nall the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs. \n\n\"Sons of Atreus,\" he cried, \"and all other Achaeans, may the gods\nwho dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach\nyour homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for\nher, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.\" \n\nOn this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting\nthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,\nwho spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. \"Old man,\" said\nhe, \"let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming\nhereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you\nnothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos\nfar from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting\nmy couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for\nyou.\" \n\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by\nthe shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom\nlovely Leto had borne. \"Hear me,\" he cried, \"O god of the silver bow,\nthat protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy\nmight, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple\nwith garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats,\ngrant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the\nDanaans.\" \n\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious\nfrom the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his\nshoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled\nwithin him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as\ndark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow\nin the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their hounds,\nbut presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and all\nday long the pyres of the dead were burning. \n\nFor nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon\nthe tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,\nwho saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon\nthem. Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.\n\n\"Son of Atreus,\" said he, \"I deem that we should now turn roving home\nif we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and\npestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader\nof dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus\nApollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we have\nbroken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will\naccept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take\naway the plague from us.\" \n\nWith these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest of\naugurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He\nit was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through\nthe prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With\nall sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:- \n\n\"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of\nKing Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear\nthat you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that\nI shall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the\nAchaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger\nof a king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge\ntill he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will\nprotect me.\" \n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon\nyou from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose\noracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his\nhand upon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth-\nno, not though you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost\nof the Achaeans.\" \n\nThereon the seer spoke boldly. \"The god,\" he said, \"is angry neither\nabout vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest's sake, whom Agamemnon\nhas dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a\nransom for her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and will\nyet send others. He will not deliver the Danaans from this pestilence\ntill Agamemnon has restored the girl without fee or ransom to her\nfather, and has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse. Thus we may perhaps\nappease him.\" \n\nWith these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heart\nwas black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchas\nand said, \"Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things concerning\nme, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You have\nbrought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come seeing\namong Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would\nnot take a ransom for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set\nmy heart on keeping her in my own house, for I love her better even\nthan my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she is alike in form and\nfeature, in understanding and accomplishments. Still I will give her\nup if I must, for I would have the people live, not die; but you must\nfind me a prize instead, or I alone among the Argives shall be without\none. This is not well; for you behold, all of you, that my prize is\nto go elsewhither.\" \n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond\nall mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have\nno common store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities\nhave been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made\nalready. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove grants\nus to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold.\"\n\nThen Agamemnon said, \"Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not\nthus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade\nme. Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss\nand give up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize\nin fair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or\nthat of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall\nrue my coming. But of this we will take thought hereafter; for the\npresent, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her\nexpressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseis\nalso; further, let some chief man among us be in command, either Ajax,\nor Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you\nare, that we may offer sacrifice and appease the the anger of the\ngod.\" \n\nAchilles scowled at him and answered, \"You are steeped in insolence\nand lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your\nbidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here\nfor any ill the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel with them.\nThey have not raided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests\non the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and them there is a great\nspace, both mountain and sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence!\nfor your pleasure, not ours- to gain satisfaction from the Trojans\nfor your shameless self and for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten\nto rob me of the prize for which I have toiled, and which the sons\nof the Achaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans sack any rich\ncity of the Trojans do I receive so good a prize as you do, though\nit is my hands that do the better part of the fighting. When the sharing\ncomes, your share is far the largest, and I, forsooth, must go back\nto my ships, take what I can get and be thankful, when my labour of\nfighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will\nbe much better for me to return home with my ships, for I will not\nstay here dishonoured to gather gold and substance for you.\"\n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Fly if you will, I shall make you no prayers\nto stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and above all\nJove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me\nas you are, for you are ever quarrelsome and ill affected. What though\nyou be brave? Was it not heaven that made you so? Go home, then, with\nyour ships and comrades to lord it over the Myrmidons. I care neither\nfor you nor for your anger; and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo\nis taking Chryseis from me, I shall send her with my ship and my followers,\nbut I shall come to your tent and take your own prize Briseis, that\nyou may learn how much stronger I am than you are, and that another\nmay fear to set himself up as equal or comparable with me.\"\n\nThe son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy breast\nwas divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside, and\nkill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger.\nWhile he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from\nits scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had sent her\nin the love she bore to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by\nhis yellow hair, visible to him alone, for of the others no man could\nsee her. Achilles turned in amaze, and by the fire that flashed from\nher eyes at once knew that she was Minerva. \"Why are you here,\" said\nhe, \"daughter of aegis-bearing Jove? To see the pride of Agamemnon,\nson of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shall surely be- he shall pay\nfor this insolence with his life.\" \n\nAnd Minerva said, \"I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bid\nyou stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you alike.\nCease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him\nif you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you- and\nit shall surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times\nas splendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore, and\nobey.\" \n\n\"Goddess,\" answered Achilles, \"however angry a man may be, he must\ndo as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear\nthe prayers of him who has obeyed them.\" \n\nHe stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it\nback into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to\nOlympus among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.\n\nBut the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus, for\nhe was still in a rage. \"Wine-bibber,\" he cried, \"with the face of\na dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host\nin fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this\nas you do death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes\nfrom any man who contradicts you. You devour your people, for you\nare king over a feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward\nyou would insult no man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a great\noath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf nor\nshoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left its parent stem\nupon the mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and bark, and\nnow the sons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians of the\ndecrees of heaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter\nthey shall look fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the\nday of your distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand\nof Hector, you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your\nheart with rage for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest\nof the Achaeans.\" \n\nWith this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on the\nground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning fiercely\nfrom his place upon the other side. Then uprose smooth-tongued Nestor,\nthe facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his lips\nsweeter than honey. Two generations of men born and bred in Pylos\nhad passed away under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third.\nWith all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-\n\n\"Of a truth,\" he said, \"a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean land.\nSurely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be glad\nat heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are\nso excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you;\ntherefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend\nof men even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.\nNever again can I behold such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd\nof his people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus\nson of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest men\never born upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought\nthe fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them.\nI came from distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they would\nhave me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now living\ncould withstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded\nby them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent\nway. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl\naway, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles;\nand you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who\nby the grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon.\nYou are strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon\nis stronger than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus,\ncheck your anger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who\nin the day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans.\"\n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, all that you have said is true, but\nthis fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord\nof all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be.\nGranted that the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also\ngiven him the right to speak with railing?\" \n\nAchilles interrupted him. \"I should be a mean coward,\" he cried, \"were\nI to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not me,\nfor I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to\nyour heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl,\nfor those that take were those also that gave. But of all else that\nis at my ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others\nmay see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood.\"\n\nWhen they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up the\nassembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back\nto his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company,\nwhile Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty\noarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb\nfor the god. And Ulysses went as captain. \n\nThese, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. But\nthe son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purified\nthemselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they offered hecatombs\nof bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore, and the smoke\nwith the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards heaven.\n\nThus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon did\nnot forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty\nmessengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. \"Go,\" said he, \"to\nthe tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and\nbring her hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others\nand take her- which will press him harder.\" \n\nHe charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon they\nwent their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to the tents\nand ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent\nand his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood\nfearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak,\nbut he knew them and said, \"Welcome, heralds, messengers of gods and\nmen; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but with Agamemnon who\nhas sent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her\nand give her to them, but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods,\nby mortal men, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon's anger, that if\never again there be need of me to save the people from ruin, they\nshall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is mad with rage and\nknows not how to look before and after that the Achaeans may fight\nby their ships in safety.\" \n\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis\nfrom the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with\nthem to the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. Then\nAchilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and looking\nout upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in prayer\nto his immortal mother, \"Mother,\" he cried, \"you bore me doomed to\nlive but for a little season; surely Jove, who thunders from Olympus,\nmight have made that little glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon, son\nof Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me of my prize by\nforce.\" \n\nAs he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was\nsitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father. Forthwith\nshe rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down before\nhim as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said, \"My\nson, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it not\nfrom me, but tell me, that we may know it together.\" \n\nAchilles drew a deep sigh and said, \"You know it; why tell you what\nyou know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of Eetion,\nsacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans\nshared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as the\nmeed of Agamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the ships\nof the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a great\nransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo, wreathed\nwith a suppliant's wreath, and he besought the Achaeans, but most\nof all the two sons of Atreus who were their chiefs. \n\n\"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting\nthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,\nwho spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So he went back\nin anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then\nthe god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick\non one another, for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host\nof the Achaeans. At last a seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared\nto us the oracles of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we\nshould appease him. Whereon the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened\nthat which he has since done. The Achaeans are now taking the girl\nin a ship to Chryse, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but\nthe heralds have just taken from my tent the daughter of Briseus,\nwhom the Achaeans had awarded to myself. \n\n\"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and\nif you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid\nof Jove. Ofttimes in my father's house have I heard you glory in that\nyou alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when\nthe others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put\nhim in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to\nOlympus the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men\nAegaeon, for he is stronger even than his father; when therefore he\ntook his seat all-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other gods\nwere afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of\nall this, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans.\nLet the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish\non the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their king,\nand that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to the\nforemost of the Achaeans.\" \n\nThetis wept and answered, \"My son, woe is me that I should have borne\nor suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free from\nall sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you\nshould be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers:\nwoe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I will\ngo to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove, if\nhe will hear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your ships,\nnurse your anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from fight.\nFor Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast among the Ethiopians,\nand the other gods went with him. He will return to Olympus twelve\ndays hence; I will then go to his mansion paved with bronze and will\nbeseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade him.\"\n\nOn this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had been\ntaken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.\nWhen they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid\nthem in the ship's hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the\nmast into its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would\nhave her lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast\nthe hawsers. They then got out upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatomb\nfor Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the\naltar to deliver her into the hands of her father. \"Chryses,\" said\nhe, \"King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child, and\nto offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may\npropitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow upon the Argives.\"\n\nSo saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her gladly,\nand they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of the\ngod. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle\nover the victims, while Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud\non their behalf. \"Hear me,\" he cried, \"O god of the silver bow, that\nprotectest Chryse and holy Cilla, and rulest Tenedos with thy might.\nEven as thou didst hear me aforetime when I prayed, and didst press\nhardly upon the Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful\npestilence from the Danaans.\" \n\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done\npraying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of\nthe victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the thigh-bones,\nwrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat\non the top of them, and then Chryses laid them on the wood fire and\npoured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged\nspits in their hands. When the thigh-bones were burned and they had\ntasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces\nupon the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off:\nthen, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they\nate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied.\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, pages filled the\nmixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving\nevery man his drink-offering. \n\nThus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning\nhim and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their\nvoices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid\nthemselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when\nthe child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they again set\nsail for the host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair wind, so\nthey raised their mast and hoisted their white sails aloft. As the\nsail bellied with the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water,\nand the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. When they\nreached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the vessel\nashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath\nher, and went their ways to their own tents and ships. \n\nBut Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not\nto the honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed\nat his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry. \n\nNow after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to Olympus,\nand Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her son\nhad laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through\ngreat heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty\nson of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. She sat herself\ndown before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while with\nher right she caught him under the chin, and besought him, saying-\n\n\"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the\nimmortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is\nto be cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking\nhis prize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord\nof counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give\nmy son his due and load him with riches in requital.\" \n\nJove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still\nkept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. \"Incline\nyour head,\" said she, \"and promise me surely, or else deny me- for\nyou have nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly you disdain\nme.\" \n\nAt this Jove was much troubled and answered, \"I shall have trouble\nif you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with\nher taunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before\nthe other gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back\nnow, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will\nbring it about as wish. See, I incline my head that you believe me.\nThis is the most solemn that I can give to any god. I never recall\nmy word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded\nmy head.\" \n\nAs he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosial\nlocks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus reeled.\n\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to his\nhouse, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged\ninto the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before\nthe coming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting,\nbut all stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat.\nBut Juno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman's daughter,\nsilver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began\nto upbraid him. \"Trickster,\" she cried, \"which of the gods have you\nbeen taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters\nin secret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could\nhelp it, one word of your intentions.\" \n\n\"Juno,\" replied the sire of gods and men, \"you must not expect to\nbe informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find\nit hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there\nis no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to\nkeep a matter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions.\"\n\n\"Dread son of Saturn,\" answered Juno, \"what are you talking about?\nI? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in everything.\nStill, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman's daughter Thetis\nhas been talking you over, for she was with you and had hold of your\nknees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that you have\nbeen promising her to give glory to Achilles, and to kill much people\nat the ships of the Achaeans.\" \n\n\"Wife,\" said Jove, \"I can do nothing but you suspect me and find it\nout. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the\nmore, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say;\nI mean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for\nif I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were\non your side it would profit you nothing.\" \n\nOn this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat\ndown in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout\nthe house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and\npacify his mother Juno. \"It will be intolerable,\" said he, \"if you\ntwo fall to wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack\nof mortals. If such ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no\npleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my mother- and she must\nherself know that it will be better- to make friends with my dear\nfather Jove, lest he again scold her and disturb our feast. If the\nOlympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from our seats, he can do\nso, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair words, and he will\nthen soon be in a good humour with us.\" \n\nAs he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his\nmother's hand. \"Cheer up, my dear mother,\" said he, \"and make the\nbest of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you\nget a thrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help for\nthere is no standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to\nhelp you, he caught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly\nthreshold. All day long from morn till eve, was I falling, till at\nsunset I came to ground in the island of Lemnos, and there I lay,\nwith very little life left in me, till the Sintians came and tended\nme.\" \n\nJuno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her son's\nhands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served\nit round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed\ngods laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ing bustling about\nthe heavenly mansion. \n\nThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted,\nand every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied. Apollo\nstruck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices, calling\nand answering one another. But when the sun's glorious light had faded,\nthey went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame Vulcan with\nhis consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove, the Olympian\nLord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always slept; and\nwhen he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden\nthrone by his side. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK II\n\nNow the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly,\nbut Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to Achilles,\nand destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In the end\nhe deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King Agamemnon;\nso he called one to him and said to it, \"Lying Dream, go to the ships\nof the Achaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to\nword as I now bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under\narms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels\namong the gods; Juno has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides\nthe Trojans.\" \n\nThe dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the\nships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found\nhim in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his\nhead in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured\nabove all his councillors, and said:- \n\n\"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his host\nand so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear\nme at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who, though he be\nnot near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get\nthe Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There\nare no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them\nover to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of\nJove. Remember this, and when you wake see that it does not escape\nyou.\" \n\nThe dream then left him, and he thought of things that were, surely\nnot to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he was to\ntake the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of\nJove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store alike for Danaans\nand Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the divine message still\nringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt\nso fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals\non to his comely feet, and slung his silver-studded sword about his\nshoulders; then he took the imperishable staff of his father, and\nsallied forth to the ships of the Achaeans. \n\nThe goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might\nherald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent\nthe criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them\nand the people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of\nthe elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were\nassembled he laid a cunning counsel before them. \n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"I have had a dream from heaven in the dead\nof night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor's. It\nhovered over my head and said, 'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one\nwho has the welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shoulders\nshould dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from\nJove, who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities\nyou. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall\ntake Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno\nhas brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans\nat the hands of Jove. Remember this.' The dream then vanished and\nI awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of the Achaeans. But\nit will be well that I should first sound them, and to this end I\nwill tell them to fly with their ships; but do you others go about\namong the host and prevent their doing so.\" \n\nHe then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all sincerity\nand goodwill addressed them thus: \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes\nand councillors of the Argives, if any other man of the Achaeans had\ntold us of this dream we should have declared it false, and would\nhave had nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it is the foremost\nman among us; we must therefore set about getting the people under\narms.\" \n\nWith this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred\nkings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the\npeople pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally\nfrom some hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring\nflowers, bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude\npour from ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon\nthe wide-watered shore, while among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger\nof Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-mell\nof mad confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as\nthe people sought their places. Nine heralds went crying about among\nthem to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till at\nlast they were got into their several places and ceased their clamour.\nThen King Agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. This was the work of\nVulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. Jove gave it to Mercury,\nslayer of Argus, guide and guardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops,\nthe mighty charioteer, and Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people.\nAtreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes\nin his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord\nof all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed\nthe Argives. \n\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven\nhas been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise\nthat I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has\nplayed me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos\nwith the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid\nmany a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his\npower is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean\nhost, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against men fewer\nin number than themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think\nthat the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and\nthat they have each been numbered- the Trojans by the roll of their\nhouseholders, and we by companies of ten; think further that each\nof our companies desired to have a Trojan householder to pour out\ntheir wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many a company\nwould have to go without its cup-bearer. But they have in the town\nallies from other places, and it is these that hinder me from being\nable to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of Jove years are gone;\nthe timbers of our ships have rotted; their tackling is sound no longer.\nOur wives and little ones at home look anxiously for our coming, but\nthe work that we came hither to do has not been done. Now, therefore,\nlet us all do as I say: let us sail back to our own land, for we shall\nnot take Troy.\" \n\nWith these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of\nthem as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to\nand fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south\nwinds break from heaven's clouds to lash them; or as when the west\nwind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast,\neven so were they swayed as they flew with loud cries towards the\nships, and the dust from under their feet rose heavenward. They cheered\neach other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels\nin front of them; they began taking away the stays from underneath\nthem, and the welkin rang with their glad cries, so eager were they\nto return. \n\nThen surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that was\nnot fated. But Juno said to Minerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing\nJove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over\nthe broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still\nkeeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at\nTroy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak\nfairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into the\nsea.\" \n\nMinerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the\ntopmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of\nthe Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, standing\nalone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grieved\nand sorry; so she went close up to him and said, \"Ulysses, noble son\nof Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and\nbe off home to your own land in this way? Will you leave Priam and\nthe Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many\nof the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about\nat once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man, that\nthey draw not their ships into the sea.\" \n\nUlysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak\nfrom him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca,\nwho waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went\nstraight up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral, imperishable\nstaff. With this he went about among the ships of the Achaeans.\n\nWhenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke him\nfairly. \"Sir,\" said he, \"this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand\nto your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not\nyet know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere long\nwill visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of us\nat the council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry\nand do us a mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and the hand\nof Jove is with them.\" \n\nBut when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he\nstruck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, \"Sirrah, hold your\npeace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward and\nno soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all\nbe kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one man\nmust be supreme- one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has given\nthe sceptre of sovereignty over you all.\" \n\nThus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people hurried\nback to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as the\nthunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and all\nthe sea is in an uproar. \n\nThe rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places,\nbut Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue- a man of\nmany words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a railer against\nall who were in authority, who cared not what he said, so that he\nmight set the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest man of all those\nthat came before Troy- bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two\nshoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a\npoint, but there was little hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses\nhated him worst of all, for it was with them that he was most wont\nto wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he began heaping\nhis abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and disgusted, yet\nnone the less he kept on brawling and bawling at the son of Atreus.\n\n\"Agamemnon,\" he cried, \"what ails you now, and what more do you want?\nYour tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever\nwe take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have yet more\ngold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when\nI or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some young girl\nto hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans,\nshould bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards, women rather\nthan men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to\nstew in his own meeds of honour, and discover whether we were of any\nservice to him or no. Achilles is a much better man than he is, and\nsee how he has treated him- robbing him of his prize and keeping it\nhimself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son\nof Atreus, you would never again insult him.\" \n\nThus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and rebuked\nhim sternly. \"Check your glib tongue, Thersites,\" said be, \"and babble\nnot a word further. Chide not with princes when you have none to back\nyou. There is no viler creature come before Troy with the sons of\nAtreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them nor\nkeep harping about going home. We do not yet know how things are going\nto be, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with good success or\nevil. How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded\nhim so many prizes? I tell you, therefore- and it shall surely be-\nthat if I again catch you talking such nonsense, I will either forfeit\nmy own head and be no more called father of Telemachus, or I will\ntake you, strip you stark naked, and whip you out of the assembly\ntill you go blubbering back to the ships.\" \n\nOn this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till\nhe dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody\nweal on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish\nas he wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him,\nyet they laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying,\n\"Ulysses has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council,\nbut he never did the Argives a better turn than when he stopped this\nfellow's mouth from prating further. He will give the kings no more\nof his insolence.\" \n\nThus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and Minerva\nin the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those who\nwere far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore\nwith all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:- \n\n\"King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among all\nmankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out from\nArgos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of\nTroy, and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set\noff homeward. True it is that they have had toil enough to be disheartened.\nA man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even for a single\nmonth, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but\nit is now nine long years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore,\nblame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed\nif we go home empty after so long a stay- therefore, my friends, be\npatient yet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings\nof Calchas were false or true. \n\n\"All who have not since perished must remember as though it were yesterday\nor the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were detained in\nAulis when we were on our way hither to make war on Priam and the\nTrojans. We were ranged round about a fountain offering hecatombs\nto the gods upon their holy altars, and there was a fine plane-tree\nfrom beneath which there welled a stream of pure water. Then we saw\na prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out of the ground, with\nblood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from under the altar\non to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of young sparrows, quite\nsmall, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves,\neight in all, and their mother that hatched them made nine. The serpent\nate the poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting\nher little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught\nher by the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had eaten both\nthe sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him become\na sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into stone, and\nwe stood there wondering at that which had come to pass. Seeing, then,\nthat such a fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, Calchas\nforthwith declared to us the oracles of heaven. 'Why, Achaeans,' said\nhe, 'are you thus speechless? Jove has sent us this sign, long in\ncoming, and long ere it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for\never. As the serpent ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that\nhatched them, which makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at Troy,\nbut in the tenth shall take the town.' This was what he said, and\nnow it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, all of you, till\nwe take the city of Priam.\" \n\nOn this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with\nthe uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. \"Shame\non you,\" he cried, \"to stay talking here like children, when you should\nfight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that\nwe have taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our\ndrink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have\nput our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our talking\nhere shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of Atreus,\nby your own steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on to battle, and\nleave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain,\nto get back to Argos ere they have learned whether Jove be true or\na liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that we should\nsucceed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon\nthe Trojans. He showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning\non our right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has\nfirst lain with the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and\nsorrow that he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if\nany man is in such haste to be at home again, let him lay his hand\nto his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all. But, O\nking, consider and give ear to my counsel, for the word that I say\nmay not be neglected lightly. Divide your men, Agamemnon, into their\nseveral tribes and clans, that clans and tribes may stand by and help\none another. If you do this, and if the Achaeans obey you, you will\nfind out who, both chiefs and peoples, are brave, and who are cowards;\nfor they will vie against the other. Thus you shall also learn whether\nit is through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice of man that you\nshall fail to take the town.\" \n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, you have again outdone the sons of\nthe Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo,\nthat I had among them ten more such councillors, for the city of King\nPriam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it.\nBut the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless wranglings and strife.\nAchilles and I are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter I\nwas the first to offend; if we can be of one mind again, the Trojans\nwill not stave off destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your\nmorning meal, that our hosts join in fight. Whet well your spears;\nsee well to the ordering of your shields; give good feeds to your\nhorses, and look your chariots carefully over, that we may do battle\nthe livelong day; for we shall have no rest, not for a moment, till\nnight falls to part us. The bands that bear your shields shall be\nwet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your hands shall weary upon\nyour spears, your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, and\nif I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at\nthe ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey\nto dogs and vultures.\" \n\nThus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves\nrun high before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty\nheadland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as\nthe storms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans\nrise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted\ntheir fires at their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice every\nman to one or other of the gods, and praying each one of them that\nhe might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed\na fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of Saturn, and invited\nthe princes and elders of his host. First he asked Nestor and King\nIdomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly\nUlysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his own accord,\nfor he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round the bull\nwith the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed, saying,\n\"Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and ridest\nupon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor the\nnight fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gates are\nconsumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt of Hector\nabout his heart, and that full many of his comrades may bite the dust\nas they fall dying round him.\" \n\nThus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer.\nHe accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil\ncontinually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal\nupon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed\nit. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers\nof fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These they\nburned upon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inward\nmeats, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-bones were\nburned, and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up\nsmall, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done,\nand drew them off; then, when they had finished their work and the\nfeast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so\nthat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\ndrink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. \"King Agamemnon,\"\nsaid he, \"let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work that\nheaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds summon the people to\ngather at their several ships; we will then go about among the host,\nthat we may begin fighting at once.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent\nthe criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called them,\nand the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of Atreus\nchose their men and marshalled them, while Minerva went among them\nholding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death. From\nit there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven, and\neach one of them worth a hundred oxen. With this she darted furiously\neverywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, urging them forward, and\nputting courage into the heart of each, so that he might fight and\ndo battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in their eyes even\nthan returning home in their ships. As when some great forest fire\nis raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so\nas they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the firmament\nof heaven. \n\nThey were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the plain\nabout the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and thither,\nglorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the\nfen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribes pour\nfrom ships and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and the ground\nrang as brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood as thick\nupon the flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in summer.\n\nAs countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman's homestead in\nthe time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even so\ndid the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and destroy\nthem. \n\nThe chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight began,\ndrafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flocks when they\nhave got mixed while feeding; and among them went King Agamemnon,\nwith a head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waist like Mars,\nand a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull that lords it\nover the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make the son of Atreus\nstand peerless among the multitude of heroes. \n\nAnd now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me- for\nyou are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things,\nwhile we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs and princes\nof the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so that I could\nnot name every single one of them though I had ten tongues, and though\nmy voice failed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless\nyou, O Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount\nthem to me. Nevertheless, I will tell the captains of the ships and\nall the fleet together. \n\nPeneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains\nof the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis,\nand who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with\nThespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma,\nEilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea\nand the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the\nhaunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and\nGlisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous\ngrove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and\nAnthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in each\nthere were a hundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians.\n\nAscalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt in\nAspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble maiden\nbore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had gone with\nMars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with her. With\nthese there came thirty ships. \n\nThe Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty\nIphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus,\nrocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt\nin Anemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus,\nand Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains\ncame forty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans,\nwhich were stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.\n\nAjax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not\nso great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was\na little man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of\nthe spear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt\nin Cynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, and\nThronium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships\nof the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea. \n\nThe fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,\nHistiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perched\ntown of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra; Elephenor\nof the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son of Chalcodon,\nand chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleet of foot\nand wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would ever\nstrive to tear open the corslets of their foes with their long ashen\nspears. Of these there came fifty ships. \n\nAnd they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great\nErechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove's daughter,\nMinerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own rich\nsanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him with\nsacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus,\nson of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the marshalling of\nchariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone rival him, for he was\nolder. With him there came fifty ships. \n\nAjax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside\nthose of the Athenians. \n\nThe men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns, with\nHermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the vineyard\nlands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came from Aegina\nand Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud battle-cry, and Sthenelus\nson of famed Capaneus. With them in command was Euryalus, son of king\nMecisteus, son of Talaus; but Diomed was chief over them all. With\nthese there came eighty ships. \n\nThose who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae;\nOrneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old; Hyperesia,\nhigh Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-land round about\nHelice; these sent a hundred ships under the command of King Agamemnon,\nson of Atreus. His force was far both finest and most numerous, and\nin their midst was the king himself, all glorious in his armour of\ngleaming bronze- foremost among the heroes, for he was the greatest\nking, and had most men under him. \n\nAnd those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills, Pharis,\nSparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae, Amyclae, and\nHelos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; these were led by\nMenelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and of them\nthere were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others. Among them\nwent Menelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for\nhe longed to avenge the toil and sorrow that he had suffered for the\nsake of Helen. \n\nThe men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the river\nAlpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum, Helos,\nand Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy\nfor ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytus lived and\nreigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses, daughters\nof aegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing against him; whereon they\nwere angry, and maimed him. They robbed him of his divine power of\nsong, and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These were\ncommanded by Nestor, knight of Gerene, and with him there came ninety\nships. \n\nAnd those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene, near\nthe tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the men\nof Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie,\nand bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus and Parrhasia;\nof these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, and they had\nsixty ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in each one of them,\nbut Agamemnon found them the ships in which to cross the sea, for\nthey were not a people that occupied their business upon the waters.\n\nThe men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is enclosed\nbetween Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock Olene and Alesium.\nThese had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships, with many\nEpeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachus and Thalpius- the\none, son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus- both of the race of\nActor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynces, and Polyxenus,\nson of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas. \n\nAnd those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt\nbeyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, and\nthe son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with his\nfather, and went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came forty\nships. \n\nUlysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum with\nits forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, with\nthe mainland also that was over against the islands. These were led\nby Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelve\nships. \n\nThoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in Pleuron,\nOlenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for the great\nking Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was also\ngolden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetolians to be\ntheir king. And with Thoas there came forty ships. \n\nThe famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,\nand the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and Lycastus\nthat lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus and Rhytium,\nwith the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete.\nAll these were led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of murderous\nMars. And with these there came eighty ships. \n\nTlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of stature,\nbrought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These dwelt in\nRhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindus, Ielysus,\nand Cameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These were commanded by Tlepolemus,\nson of Hercules by Astyochea, whom he had carried off from Ephyra,\non the river Selleis, after sacking many cities of valiant warriors.\nWhen Tlepolemus grew up, he killed his father's uncle Licymnius, who\nhad been a famous warrior in his time, but was then grown old. On\nthis he built himself a fleet, gathered a great following, and fled\nbeyond the sea, for he was menaced by the other sons and grandsons\nof Hercules. After a voyage. during which he suffered great hardship,\nhe came to Rhodes, where the people divided into three communities,\naccording to their tribes, and were dearly loved by Jove, the lord,\nof gods and men; wherefore the son of Saturn showered down great riches\nupon them. \n\nAnd Nireus brought three ships from Syme- Nireus, who was the handsomest\nman that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus-\nbut he was a man of no substance, and had but a small following.\n\nAnd those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the city\nof Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commanded by Pheidippus\nand Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son of Hercules. And\nwith them there came thirty ships. \n\nThose again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; and\nthose of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were called\nMyrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over which\nAchilles was in command. But they now took no part in the war, inasmuch\nas there was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed by his ships,\nfurious about the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he had taken from\nLyrnessus at his own great peril, when he had sacked Lyrnessus and\nThebe, and had overthrown Mynes and Epistrophus, sons of king Evenor,\nson of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still grieving, but ere\nlong he was again to join them. \n\nAnd those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus, sanctuary\nof Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea, and Pteleum\nthat lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaus had been\ncaptain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under the earth.\nHe had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeks in sorrow,\nand his house was only half finished, for he was slain by a Dardanian\nwarrior while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil of Troy.\nStill, though his people mourned their chieftain, they were not without\na leader, for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled them; he was\nson of Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son of Phylacus, and he\nwas own brother to Protesilaus, only younger, Protesilaus being at\nonce the elder and the more valiant. So the people were not without\na leader, though they mourned him whom they had lost. With him there\ncame forty ships. \n\nAnd those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe, Glaphyrae,\nand the populous city of Iolcus, these with their eleven ships were\nled by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore to him, loveliest\nof the daughters of Pelias. \n\nAnd those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and rugged\nOlizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and they\nhad seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good archers;\nbut Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the Island of Lemnos, where\nthe sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had been bitten by a poisonous\nwater snake. There he lay sick and sorry, and full soon did the Argives\ncome to miss him. But his people, though they felt his loss were not\nleaderless, for Medon, the bastard son of Oileus by Rhene, set them\nin array. \n\nThose, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they that\nheld Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were commanded\nby the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of healing, Podalirius\nand Machaon. And with them there came thirty ships. \n\nThe men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia, with\nthose that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus, these were\nled by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them there came forty\nships. \n\nThose that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white city\nof Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was son of Pirithous,\nwho was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him to Pirithous\non the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain savages\nand drove them from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoetes was\nnot sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the race of Mars,\nwho was son of Coronus, the son of Caeneus. And with these there came\nforty ships. \n\nGuneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followed\nby the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona,\nand held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sends\nits waters into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver eddies\nof the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for the Titaresius\nis a branch of dread Orcus and of the river Styx. \n\nOf the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They were\nthey that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleet\nof foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.\n\nSuch were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O Muse,\nwas the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that followed\nafter the sons of Atreus? \n\nOf the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest.\nThey were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They were\nof the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo,\nof the silver bow, had bred them in Perea- both of them mares, and\nterrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was\nmuch the foremost so long as Achilles' anger lasted, for Achilles\nexcelled him greatly and he had also better horses; but Achilles was\nnow holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel with Agamemnon,\nand his people passed their time upon the sea shore, throwing discs\nor aiming with spears at a mark, and in archery. Their horses stood\neach by his own chariot, champing lotus and wild celery. The chariots\nwere housed under cover, but their owners, for lack of leadership,\nwandered hither and thither about the host and went not forth to fight.\n\nThus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned\nbeneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land\nabout Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even\nso did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.\n\nAnd now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad\nnews among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young,\nat Priam's gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the\nvoice of Priam's son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed\nas watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes, to look out\nfor any sally of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke, saying,\n\"Old man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war is at hand.\nI have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such a host as is\nnow advancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city as thick\nas leaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you above all\nothers, do as I say. There are many allies dispersed about the city\nof Priam from distant places and speaking divers tongues. Therefore,\nlet each chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally\nin array and leading them forth to battle.\" \n\nThus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at once\nbroke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were opened,\nand the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the tramp\nas of a great multitude. \n\nNow there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon the\nplain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb\nof lithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.\n\nPriam's son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the Trojans,\nand with him were arrayed by far the greater number and most valiant\nof those who were longing for the fray. \n\nThe Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to Anchises,\nwhen she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the mountain\nslopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two sons of\nAntenor, Archilochus and Acamas, both skilled in all the arts of war.\n\nThey that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men of\nsubstance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are of\nTrojan blood- these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollo\nhad taught to use the bow. \n\nThey that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia, and\nthe high mountain of Tereia- these were led by Adrestus and Amphius,\nwhose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops of Percote,\nwho excelled in all kinds of divination. He told them not to take\npart in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured them to\ndestruction. \n\nThey that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, and\nArisbe- these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave commander-\nAsius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of\nthe breed that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.\n\nHippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in fertile\nLarissa- Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons of\nthe Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus. \n\nAcamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those that\ncame from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont. \n\nEuphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the Ciconian\nspearsmen. \n\nPyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the broad\nwaters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the earth.\n\nThe Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from\nEnetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held\nCytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river\nParthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini. \n\nOdius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant\nAlybe, where there are mines of silver. \n\nChromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in\naugury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by the\nhand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slew\nothers also of the Trojans. \n\nPhorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far\ncountry of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray. \n\nMesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes,\nborn to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dwelt\nunder Mt. Tmolus. \n\nNastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held Miletus\nand the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of the river Maeander\nand the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were commanded by Nastes\nand Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He came into the fight\nwith gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold was of\nno avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the\nfleet descendant of Aeacus, and Achilles bore away his gold.\n\nSarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by the\neddying waters of the Xanthus. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK III\n\nWhen the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,\nthe Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream\noverhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters of\nOceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle\nin the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently, in high\nheart, and minded to stand by one another. \n\nAs when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain\ntops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man\ncan see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust\nfrom under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.\n\nWhen they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward\nas champion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin\nof a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears\nshod with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to\nmeet him in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before\nthe ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase\nof some goat or horned stag, and devours it there and then, though\ndogs and youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his\neyes caught sight of Alexandrus, for he deemed that now he should\nbe revenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit\nof armour. \n\nAlexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in\nfear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted,\ntrembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some\nmountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the throng of Trojan\nwarriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son Atreus.\n\nThen Hector upbraided him. \"Paris,\" said he, \"evil-hearted Paris,\nfair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had\nnever been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live\nto be disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock\nat us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to\nsee but who has neither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you\nare, get your following together and sail beyond the seas? Did you\nnot from your a far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among\na people of warriors- to bring sorrow upon your father, your city,\nand your whole country, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness\nto yourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what\nmanner of man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would\nbe your lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair\nfavour, when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are\na weak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones\nfor the wrongs you have done them.\" \n\nAnd Alexandrus answered, \"Hector, your rebuke is just. You are hard\nas the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the\ntimber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge\nof your scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus\nhas given me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the\ngods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for the\nasking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans\nand Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in their midst\nfor Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and\nprove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear\nthem to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace\nwhereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the others go home\nto Argos and the land of the Achaeans.\" \n\nWhen Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan\nranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they\nall sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at him with\nstones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying, \"Hold, Argives,\nshoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak.\"\n\nThey ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. \"Hear\nfrom my mouth,\" said he, \"Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of Alexandrus,\nthrough whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and\nAchaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight\nin the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall\nbe victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all\nshe has, to bear them to his own home, but let the rest swear to a\nsolemn covenant of peace.\" \n\nThus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of the\nloud battle-cry addressed them. \"And now,\" he said, \"hear me too,\nfor it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of\nAchaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much\nhave suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did\nme. Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more.\nBring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and\nSun, and we will bring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priam\ncome, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his sons are\nhigh-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must not be transgressed\nor taken in vain. Young men's minds are light as air, but when an\nold man comes he looks before and after, deeming that which shall\nbe fairest upon both sides.\" \n\nThe Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they\nthought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots\ntoward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying\nit down upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with\na little space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city\nto bring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius\nto fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had\nsaid. \n\nMeanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law, wife\nof the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodice,\nthe fairest of Priam's daughters. She found her in her own room, working\nat a great web of purple linen, on which she was embroidering the\nbattles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had made them fight\nfor her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said, \"Come hither,\nchild, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and Achaeans till\nnow they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle,\nbut now they have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields,\nsitting still with their spears planted beside them. Alexandrus and\nMenelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to the the\nwife of him who is the victor.\" \n\nThus spoke the goddess, and Helen's heart yearned after her former\nhusband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over\nher head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone,\nbut attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus,\nand Clymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.\n\nThe two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were seated\nby the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus, Clytius,\nand Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to fight, but\nthey were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrup\ndelicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. When they\nsaw Helen coming towards the tower, they said softly to one another,\n\"Small wonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endure so much and\nso long, for the sake of a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely.\nStill, fair though she be, let them take her and go, or she will breed\nsorrow for us and for our children after us.\" \n\nBut Priam bade her draw nigh. \"My child,\" said he, \"take your seat\nin front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen\nand your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you\nwho are to blame. It is they that have brought about this terrible\nwar with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great\nand goodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and\nso royal. Surely he must be a king.\" \n\n\"Sir,\" answered Helen, \"father of my husband, dear and reverend in\nmy eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here\nwith your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling\ndaughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to\nbe, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the\nhero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and\na brave soldier, brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my\nabhorred and miserable self.\" \n\nThe old man marvelled at him and said, \"Happy son of Atreus, child\nof good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great\nmultitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people\nof Otreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river\nSangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers\nof men, came up against them, but even they were not so many as the\nAchaeans.\" \n\nThe old man next looked upon Ulysses; \"Tell me,\" he said, \"who is\nthat other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the\nchest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks\nin front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his\newes.\" \n\nAnd Helen answered, \"He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of Laertes.\nHe was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner of stratagems\nand subtle cunning.\" \n\nOn this Antenor said, \"Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once\ncame here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I received\nthem in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and\nconversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans,\nMenelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses\nhad the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their message,\nand the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not\nsay much, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly\nand to the point, though he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses,\non the other hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent and\nkept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful\nmovement of his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man\nunpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for a mere churl\nor simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came driving\nfrom his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then there was\nnone to touch him, and no man thought further of what he looked like.\"\n\nPriam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, \"Who is that great and\ngoodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest\nof the Argives?\" \n\n\"That,\" answered Helen, \"is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, and\non the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus looking\nlike a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him. Often\ndid Menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting\nus from Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I\ncould tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor,\nbreaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they are children\nof my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have not left\nLacedaemon, or else, though they have brought their ships, they will\nnot show themselves in battle for the shame and disgrace that I have\nbrought upon them.\" \n\nShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earth\nin their own land of Lacedaemon. \n\nMeanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through\nthe city- two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and\nIdaeus brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to\nPriam and said, \"Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and Achaeans\nbid you come down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant.\nAlexandrus and Menelaus are to fight for Helen in single combat, that\nshe and all her wealth may go with him who is the victor. We are to\nswear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we others shall dwell\nhere in Troy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the\nAchaeans.\" \n\nThe old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the\nhorses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him;\nthey then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When they\nreached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the chariot,\nand with measured pace advanced into the space between the hosts.\n\nAgamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought\non the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they\npoured water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus\ndrew the dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs'\nheads; this the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean\nprinces, and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. \"Father\nJove,\" he cried, \"that rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and\nthou oh Sun, that seest and givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers,\nand ye who in the realms below chastise the soul of him that has broken\nhis oath, witness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain.\nIf Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and all her wealth,\nwhile we sail home with our ships; but if Menelaus kills Alexandrus,\nlet the Trojans give back Helen and all that she has; let them moreover\npay such fine to the Achaeans as shall be agreed upon, in testimony\namong those that shall be born hereafter. Aid if Priam and his sons\nrefuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay here\nand fight on till I have got satisfaction.\" \n\nAs he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and\nlaid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had\nreft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl\ninto the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans\nand Achaeans among one another, \"Jove, most great and glorious, and\nye other everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them who shall\nfirst sin against their oaths- of them and their children- may be\nshed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wives become\nthe slaves of strangers.\" \n\nThus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.\nThen Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, \"Hear me, Trojans\nand Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius:\nI dare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and\nMenelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shall\nfall.\" \n\nOn this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two\nthen went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and\ncast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first.\nMeanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying, \"Father\nJove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that he\nwho first brought about this war between us may die, and enter the\nhouse of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths.\"\n\nGreat Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,\nand the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several\nstations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying,\nwhile Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly armour.\nFirst he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted with\nancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his brother\nLycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On\nhis comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair\nthat nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spear\nthat suited his hands. In like fashion Menelaus also put on his armour.\n\nWhen they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierce\nof aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans were\nstruck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on\nthe measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against\nthe other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the round shield of\nthe son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield\nturned its point. Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as\nhe did so. \"King Jove,\" he said, \"grant me revenge on Alexandrus who\nhas wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come\na man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of his host.\"\n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of Alexandrus.\nThrough shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt by his flank,\nbut Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then the son\nof Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part of his\nhelmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces from his\nhand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, \"Father Jove, of all gods\nthou art the most despiteful; I made sure of my revenge, but the sword\nhas broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I have\nnot killed him.\" \n\nWith this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume\nof his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The strap\nof the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and Menelaus\nwould have dragged him off to his own great glory had not Jove's daughter\nVenus been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that\nthe empty helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades\namong the Achaeans, and was again springing upon Alexandrus to run\nhim through with a spear, but Venus snatched him up in a moment (as\na god can do), hid him under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him\nto his own bedchamber. \n\nThen she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with the\nTrojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman\nwho used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and\nof whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed\nrobe and said, \"Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to the\nhouse; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed\nin gorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just come from fighting,\nbut rather that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was\nsitting down.\" \n\nWith these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she marked\nthe beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling\neyes, she marvelled at her and said, \"Goddess, why do you thus beguile\nme? Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom\nyou have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished\nAlexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with him. You are\ncome here to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth\nbe goddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to Olympus;\nworry about him and look after him till he make you his wife, or,\nfor the matter of that, his slave- but me? I shall not go; I can garnish\nhis bed no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women of Troy.\nBesides, I have trouble on my mind.\" \n\nVenus was very angry, and said, \"Bold hussy, do not provoke me; if\nyou do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I have\nloved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans,\nand you shall come to a bad end.\" \n\nAt this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and\nwent in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan\nwomen. \n\nWhen they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set about\ntheir work, but Helen went into her own room, and the laughter-loving\ngoddess took a seat and set it for her facing Alexandrus. On this\nHelen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down, and with eyes askance\nbegan to upbraid her husband. \n\n\"So you are come from the fight,\" said she; \"would that you had fallen\nrather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You used\nto brag that you were a better man with hands and spear than Menelaus.\ngo, but I then, an challenge him again- but I should advise you not\nto do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet him in single combat,\nyou will soon all by his spear.\" \n\nAnd Paris answered, \"Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches. This\ntime, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me; another\ntime I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will stand by\nme. Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Never yet was\nI so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment- not even when\nI first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you-\nnot even when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in the\nisland of Cranae was I so enthralled by desire of you as now.\" On\nthis he led her towards the bed, and his wife went with him.\n\nThus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus\nstrode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no\nman, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If\nthey had seen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of\nthem hated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men,\nspoke, saying, \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory\nhas been with Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all her wealth,\nand pay such fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them\nthat shall be born hereafter.\" \n\nThus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK IV\n\nNow the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor\nwhile Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as\nthey pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon\nthe town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno, talking\nat her so as to provoke her. \"Menelaus,\" said he, \"has two good friends\namong the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva of Alalcomene, but\nthey only sit still and look on, while Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus'\nside to defend him in any danger; indeed she has just rescued him\nwhen he made sure that it was all over with him- for the victory really\ndid lie with Menelaus. We must consider what we shall do about all\nthis; shall we set them fighting anew or make peace between them?\nIf you will agree to this last Menelaus can take back Helen and the\ncity of Priam may remain still inhabited.\" \n\nMinerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by side\nhatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father,\nfor she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but Juno\ncould not contain herself. \"Dread son of Saturn,\" said she, \"what,\npray, is the meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to go for nothing,\nand the sweat that I have sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while\ngetting the people together against Priam and his children? Do as\nyou will, but we other gods shall not all of us approve your counsel.\"\n\nJove was angry and answered, \"My dear, what harm have Priam and his\nsons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of Ilius?\nWill nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat Priam\nraw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it your\nown way then; for I would not have this matter become a bone of contention\nbetween us. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, if ever\nI want to sack a city belonging to friends of yours, you must not\ntry to stop me; you will have to let me do it, for I am giving in\nto you sorely against my will. Of all inhabited cities under the sun\nand stars of heaven, there was none that I so much respected as Ilius\nwith Priam and his whole people. Equitable feasts were never wanting\nabout my altar, nor the savour of burning fat, which is honour due\nto ourselves.\" \n\n\"My own three favourite cities,\" answered Juno, \"are Argos, Sparta,\nand Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased with them. I\nshall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, and tried\nto stay you, I should take nothing by it, for you are much stronger\nthan I am, but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am a god\nand of the same race with yourself. I am Saturn's eldest daughter,\nand am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I am your\nwife, and you are king over the gods. Let it be a case, then, of give-and-take\nbetween us, and the rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Minerva\nto go and take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that\nthe Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the\nAchaeans.\" \n\nThe sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva, \"Go\nat once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that the Trojans\nshall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans.\"\n\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted\nfrom the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as some\nbrilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as a sign\nto mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of light follows\nin its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe as they\nbeheld, and one would turn to his neighbour, saying, \"Either we shall\nagain have war and din of combat, or Jove the lord of battle will\nnow make peace between us.\" \n\nThus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus, son\nof Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find Pandarus,\nthe redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing among the stalwart\nheroes who had followed him from the banks of the Aesopus, so she\nwent close up to him and said, \"Brave son of Lycaon, will you do as\nI tell you? If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus you will win honour\nand thanks from all the Trojans, and especially from prince Alexandrus-\nhe would be the first to requite you very handsomely if he could see\nMenelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your hand.\nTake your home aim then, and pray to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer;\nvow that when you get home to your strong city of Zelea you will offer\na hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.\" \n\nHis fool's heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case.\nThis bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed\nas it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen\nas the arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms\nlong, and a worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them\nwell down, and giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung\nhis bow he laid it carefully on the ground, and his brave followers\nheld their shields before him lest the Achaeans should set upon him\nbefore he had shot Menelaus. Then he opened the lid of his quiver\nand took out a winged arrow that had yet been shot, fraught with the\npangs of death. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian\nApollo, the famous archer, vowing that when he got home to his strong\ncity of Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his\nhonour. He laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and\ndrew both notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near\nthe bow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly,\nand the bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly\non over the heads of the throng. \n\nBut the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove's daughter,\ndriver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee and ward off\nthe piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a mother whisks\na fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly; she guided it\nto the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed over\nhis double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt that\nwent tightly round him. It went right through this and through the\ncuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the belt beneath it,\nwhich he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows; it was this\nthat served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went through\nit and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood began flowing from\nthe wound. \n\nAs when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a piece\nof ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to be laid\nup in a treasure house- many a knight is fain to bear it, but the\nking keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and driver may be\nproud- even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your legs\ndown to your fair ancles stained with blood. \n\nWhen King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was afraid,\nand so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbs of the\narrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft were still\noutside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaved a deep\nsigh as he held Menelaus's hand in his own, and his comrades made\nmoan in concert. \"Dear brother, \"he cried, \"I have been the death\nof you in pledging this covenant and letting you come forward as our\nchampion. The Trojans have trampled on their oaths and have wounded\nyou; nevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings\nand the right hands of fellowship in which have put our trust shall\nnot be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now,\nhe. will yet fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their\nlives and with their wives and children. The day will surely come\nwhen mighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam's people,\nwhen the son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them\nwith his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This\nshall surely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your\nlot now to die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans\nwill at once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory\nof still keeping Helen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie\nhere at Troy with your purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggart\nTrojan leap upon your tomb and say, 'Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak\nhis vengeance; he brought his army in vain; he is gone home to his\nown land with empty ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.' Thus\nwill one of them say, and may the earth then swallow me.\"\n\nBut Menelaus reassured him and said, \"Take heart, and do not alarm\nthe people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer\nbelt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass\nand the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me.\" \n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be even\nso, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it\nto relieve your pain.\" \n\nHe then said to Talthybius, \"Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the\ngreat physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately.\nSome Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our\ndismay, and to his own great glory.\" \n\nTalthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to find\nMachaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors who had\nfollowed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and said, \"Son\nof Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and see Menelaus\nimmediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an\narrow to our dismay and to his own great glory.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed through\nthe spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they came to the\nplace where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying with the chieftains\ngathered in a circle round him. Machaon passed into the middle of\nthe ring and at once drew the arrow from the belt, bending its barbs\nback through the force with which he pulled it out. He undid the burnished\nbelt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt of mail which the\nbronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped\naway the blood and applied some soothing drugs which Chiron had given\nto Aesculapius out of the good will he bore him. \n\nWhile they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forward\nagainst them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed the\nfight. \n\nYou would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and unwilling\nto fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariot rich\nwith bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son of\nPtolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readiness\nagainst the time his limbs should weary of going about and giving\norders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw\nmen hasting to the front he stood by them and cheered them on. \"Argives,\"\nsaid he, \"slacken not one whit in your onset; father Jove will be\nno helper of liars; the Trojans have been the first to break their\noaths and to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured of vultures;\nwe shall take their city and carry off their wives and children in\nour ships.\" \n\nBut he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined\nto fight. \"Argives,\" he cried, \"cowardly miserable creatures, have\nyou no shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can\nno longer scud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight?\nYou are as dazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans\nreach the sterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whether\nthe son of Saturn will hold his hand over you to protect you?\"\n\nThus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing through\nthe crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round Idomeneus,\nwho was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while Meriones was bringing\nup the battalions that were in the rear. Agamemnon was glad when he\nsaw him, and spoke him fairly. \"Idomeneus,\" said he, \"I treat you\nwith greater distinction than I do any others of the Achaeans, whether\nin war or in other things, or at table. When the princes are mixing\nmy choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed\nallowance, but your cup is kept always full like my own, that you\nmay drink whenever you are minded. Go, therefore, into battle, and\nshow yourself the man you have been always proud to be.\"\n\nIdomeneus answered, \"I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised you\nfrom the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we may\njoin battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon their covenants.\nDeath and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have been the first\nto break their oaths and to attack us.\" \n\nThe son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the two\nAjaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when a goat-herd\nfrom some high post watches a storm drive over the deep before the\nwest wind- black as pitch is the offing and a mighty whirlwind draws\ntowards him, so that he is afraid and drives his flock into a cave-\neven thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark mass to\nbattle under the Ajaxes, horrid with shield and spear. Glad was King\nAgamemnon when he saw them. \"No need,\" he cried, \"to give orders to\nsuch leaders of the Argives as you are, for of your own selves you\nspur your men on to fight with might and main. Would, by father Jove,\nMinerva, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are, for the city\nof Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack\nit.\" \n\nWith this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker\nof the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, in\ncompany with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherd\nof his people. He placed his knights with their chariots and horses\nin the front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom\nhe could trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle,\nthat they might fight whether they would or no. He gave his orders\nto the knights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand,\nso as to avoid confusion. \"Let no man,\" he said, \"relying on his strength\nor horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with the\nTrojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your attack;\nbut let each when he meets an enemy's chariot throw his spear from\nhis own; this be much the best; this is how the men of old took towns\nand strongholds; in this wise were they minded.\" \n\nThus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight,\nand King Agamemnon was glad. \"I wish,\" he said to him, that your limbs\nwere as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but\nage, the common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would\nthat it had fallen upon some other, and that you were still young.\"\n\nAnd Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, \"Son of Atreus, I too would\ngladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but the gods\nwill not give us everything at one and the same time. I was then young,\nand now I am old; still I can go with my knights and give them that\ncounsel which old men have a right to give. The wielding of the spear\nI leave to those who are younger and stronger than myself.\"\n\nAgamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,\nson of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the Athenians\nloud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning Ulysses, with\nhis sturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not yet heard the battle-cry,\nfor the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had only just begun to move,\nso they were standing still, waiting for some other columns of the\nAchaeans to attack the Trojans and begin the fighting. When he saw\nthis Agamemnon rebuked them and said, \"Son of Peteos, and you other,\nsteeped in cunning, heart of guile, why stand you here cowering and\nwaiting on others? You two should be of all men foremost when there\nis hard fighting to be done, for you are ever foremost to accept my\ninvitation when we councillors of the Achaeans are holding feast.\nYou are glad enough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink\nwine as long as you please, whereas now you would not care though\nyou saw ten columns of Achaeans engage the enemy in front of you.\"\n\nUlysses glared at him and answered, \"Son of Atreus, what are you talking\nabout? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeans are in\nfull fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to do so,\nthat the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremost of\nthem. You are talking idly.\" \n\nWhen Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly at\nhim and withdrew his words. \"Ulysses,\" said he, \"noble son of Laertes,\nexcellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders\nto give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are\nof a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and\nif any ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing.\"\n\nHe then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son\nof Tydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with\nSthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to upbraid\nhim. \"Son of Tydeus,\" he said, \"why stand you cowering here upon the\nbrink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever ahead of\nhis men when leading them on against the foe- so, at least, say they\nthat saw him in battle, for I never set eyes upon him myself. They\nsay that there was no man like him. He came once to Mycenae, not as\nan enemy but as a guest, in company with Polynices to recruit his\nforces, for they were levying war against the strong city of Thebes,\nand prayed our people for a body of picked men to help them. The men\nof Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but Jove dissuaded them\nby showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus, therefore, and Polynices\nwent their way. When they had got as far the deep-meadowed and rush-grown\nbanks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as their envoy, and\nhe found the Cadmeans gathered in great numbers to a banquet in the\nhouse of Eteocles. Stranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding\nhimself single-handed among so many, but challenged them to contests\nof all kinds, and in each one of them was at once victorious, so mightily\ndid Minerva help him. The Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and\nset a force of fifty youths with two captains- the godlike hero Maeon,\nson of Haemon, and Polyphontes, son of Autophonus- at their head,\nto lie in wait for him on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every\nman of them, save only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven's\nomens. Such was Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but\nhe cannot fight as his father did.\" \n\nDiomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon;\nbut the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, \"Son of Atreus,\ntell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boast ourselves\nas even better men than our fathers; we took seven-gated Thebes, though\nthe wall was stronger and our men were fewer in number, for we trusted\nin the omens of the gods and in the help of Jove, whereas they perished\nthrough their own sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in like\nhonour with us.\" \n\nDiomed looked sternly at him and said, \"Hold your peace, my friend,\nas I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge the Achaeans\nforward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, and his the\nshame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us acquit ourselves with\nvalour.\" \n\nAs he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so fiercely\nabout his body that even a brave man might well have been scared to\nhear it. \n\nAs when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west\nwind has lashed it into fury- it has reared its head afar and now\ncomes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high over\nthe jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions- even so\ndid the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly to battle.\nThe chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but the men said never\na word; no man would think it, for huge as the host was, it seemed\nas though there was not a tongue among them, so silent were they in\ntheir obedience; and as they marched the armour about their bodies\nglistened in the sun. But the clamour of the Trojan ranks was as that\nof many thousand ewes that stand waiting to be milked in the yards\nof some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating\nof their lambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but their\ntongues were diverse, and they came from many different places. These\nwere inspired of Mars, but the others by Minerva- and with them came\nPanic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister and friend\nof murderous Mars, who, from being at first but low in stature, grows\ntill she uprears her head to heaven, though her feet are still on\nearth. She it was that went about among them and flung down discord\nto the waxing of sorrow with even hand between them. \n\nWhen they were got together in one place shield clashed with shield\nand spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed shields beat\none upon another, and there was a tramp as of a great multitude- death-cry\nand shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with\nblood. As torrents swollen with rain course madly down their deep\nchannels till the angry floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd\nthe hillside hears their roaring from afar- even such was the toil\nand uproar of the hosts as they joined in battle. \n\nFirst Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,\nson of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at the\nprojecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the\npoint of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; headlong\nas a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he dropped\nKing Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and captain of the proud Abantes\nbegan dragging him out of reach of the darts that were falling around\nhim, in haste to strip him of his armour. But his purpose was not\nfor long; Agenor saw him haling the body away, and smote him in the\nside with his bronze-shod spear- for as he stooped his side was left\nunprotected by his shield- and thus he perished. Then the fight between\nTrojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew upon\neach other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.\n\nForthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius, son\nof Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois, as\nshe was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with her parents\nto see their flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but he did\nnot live to pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off untimely\nby the spear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast by the right\nnipple as he was coming on among the foremost fighters; the spear\nwent right through his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has\ngrown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick\nwith branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that\nhe may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and\nit lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell to\nearth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the gleaming\ncorslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid the crowd\nand missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of Ulysses, in\nthe groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over to the other\nside; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it. Ulysses\nwas furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armour through\nthe front ranks till he was quite close; then he glared round about\nhim and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he did so. His dart\nwas not sped in vain, for it struck Democoon, the bastard son of Priam,\nwho had come to him from Abydos, where he had charge of his father's\nmares. Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with\nhis spear on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the\nother side of his forehead. Thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\nHector, and they that were in front, then gave round while the Argives\nraised a shout and drew off the dead, pressing further forward as\nthey did so. But Apollo looked down from Pergamus and called aloud\nto the Trojans, for he was displeased. \"Trojans,\" he cried, \"rush\non the foe, and do not let yourselves be thus beaten by the Argives.\nTheir skins are not stone nor iron that when hit them you do them\nno harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son of lovely Thetis, is not fighting,\nbut is nursing his anger at the ships.\" \n\nThus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while Jove's\nredoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the host of\nthe Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them slackening.\n\nThen fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck by\na jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled it\nwas Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had come\nfrom Aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed by the pitiless\nstone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his death throes\nstretched out his hands towards his comrades. But Peirous, who had\nwounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into his belly, so that\nhis bowels came gushing out upon the ground, and darkness veiled his\neyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of Aetolia struck him in the\nchest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself in his lungs. Thoas\ncame close up to him, pulled the spear out of his chest, and then\ndrawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so that he\ndied; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his Thracian comrades,\nmen who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads, stood\nround the body and kept him off with their long spears for all his\ngreat stature and valour; so he was driven back. Thus the two corpses\nlay stretched on earth near to one another, the one captain of the\nThracians and the other of the Epeans; and many another fell round\nthem. \n\nAnd now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could have\ngone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva leading\nhim by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and arrows.\nFor many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side\nface downwards upon the earth. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK V\n\nThen Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus,\nthat he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself with\nglory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet\nlike the star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath\nin the waters of Oceanus- even such a fire did she kindle upon his\nhead and shoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly\nof the fight. \n\nNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,\npriest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus\nand Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two\ncame forward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he\nbeing on foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were\nclose up to one another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went\nover Diomed's left shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw,\nand his spear sped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near\nthe nipple, and he fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride\nhis brother's body, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight,\nor he would have shared his brother's fate; whereon Vulcan saved him\nby wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old father might\nnot be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus drove\noff with the horses, and bade his followers take them to the ships.\nThe Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of\nthem in fright and the other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore,\ntook Mars by the hand and said, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained\nstormer of cities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to\nfight it out, and see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the\nvictory? Let us go away, and thus avoid his anger.\" \n\nSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon\nthe steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the\nTrojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First\nKing Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his\nchariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,\njust as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders\nand went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round\nhim as he fell heavily to the ground. \n\nThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come\nfrom Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as\nhe was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded\nhim as he fell heavily from the car. \n\nThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus,\nson of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman\nand keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill\nevery kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but\nneither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for\nthe spear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it\nstruck him between the shoulders and went right through his chest,\nso that he fell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.\n\nMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son\nof Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning workmanship,\nfor Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that made the ships\nfor Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all mischief, and brought\nevil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus himself; for he heeded\nnot the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him as he was flying,\nand struck him on the right buttock. The point of the spear went through\nthe bone into the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud\nand fell forward on his knees. \n\nMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was\na bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children,\nfor the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up\nto him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under\nhis tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell\ndead in the dust. \n\nAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble Dolopion,\nwho had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was honoured\namong the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him chase\nas he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the arm,\nand lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to the\nground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can withstand,\ncame over his eyes. \n\nThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of\nTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or\nthe Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that\nhas burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful\nvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven,\nbut in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste\nthat many a strong man hand has reclaimed- even so were the dense\nphalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and\nmany though they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.\n\nNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving\nthe Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front\npart of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through\nthe metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with\nblood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, \"Knights Trojans,\ncome on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold\nout much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from\nLycia hither.\" \n\nThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew\nand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.\n\"Dear son of Capaneus,\" said he, \"come down from your chariot, and\ndraw the arrow out of my shoulder.\" \n\nSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound,\nwhereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been\nmade in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, \"Hear me, daughter\nof aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well\nand stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant\nme to come within a spear's throw of that man and kill him. He has\nbeen too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that\nI shall not see the light of the sun much longer.\" \n\nThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple\nand quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him\nand said, \"Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I\nhave set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus.\nMoreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know\ngods and men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers\nyou battle, do not fight him; but should Jove's daughter Venus come,\nstrike her with your spear and wound her.\" \n\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again\ntook his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce\neven than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain\nshepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the\nwall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused\nthe brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter\nunder cover of the buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being\ndeserted, are smothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the\nangry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed\ngo furiously about among the Trojans. \n\nHe killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with a thrust\nof his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with a\nsword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his\nneck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas\nand Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never\ncame back for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed\nmade an end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the\ntwo sons of Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now\nworn out with age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions.\nBut Diomed took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly,\nfor he nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen\ndivided his wealth among themselves. \n\nThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they\nwere both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on\nthe neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice.\nFor all their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot\nand stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses\nto his comrades to take them back to the ships. \n\nWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through\nthe fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus.\nWhen he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, \"Pandarus, where\nis now your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer,\nin respect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in\nLycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an\narrow at this fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done\nsuch deadly work among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man-\nunless indeed he is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their\nsacrifices, and and has set his hand against them in his displeasure.\"\n\nAnd the son of Lycaon answered, \"Aeneas, I take him for none other\nthan the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his\nhelmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but\nif he is the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without\nheaven's help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud\nof darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I\nhave taken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my\narrow went through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure\nI should send him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I\nhave not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover\nI have neither horse nor chariot. In my father's stables there are\neleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with\ncloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of\nhorses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again\nand again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take\nchariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle,\nbut I would not listen to him; it would have been much better if I\nhad done so, but I was thinking about the horses, which had been used\nto eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a great gathering\nof men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot\nto Ilius armed only with my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of\nno use, for I have already hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus\nand of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, I have only\nmade them still more furious. I did ill to take my bow down from its\npeg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius in Hector's service,\nand if ever I get home again to set eyes on my native place, my wife,\nand the greatness of my house, may some one cut my head off then and\nthere if I do not break the bow and set it on a hot fire- such pranks\nas it plays me.\" \n\nAeneas answered, \"Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go\nagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial\nof arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros\ncan speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight.\nIf Jove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry\nus safely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins\nwhile I stand upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man's\nonset while I look after the horses.\" \n\n\"Aeneas.\" replied the son of Lycaon, \"take the reins and drive; if\nwe have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better\nfor their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they\nexpect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the\nfight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses.\nTherefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my\nspear.\" \n\nThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son\nof Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to\nDiomed, \"Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two\nheroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful\narcher, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is Anchises,\nwhile his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us retreat. Do\nnot, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get killed.\"\n\nDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: \"Talk not of flight, for\nI shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight\nnor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount,\nbut will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid\nof no man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall\nnot take both back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your\nheart- if Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both,\nstay your horses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot;\nthen be sure you spring Aeneas' horses and drive them from the Trojan\nto the Achaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to\nTros in payment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live\nand move under the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his\nmares to them without Laomedon's knowledge, and they bore him six\nfoals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the other two to\nAeneas. We shall win great glory if we can take them.\" \n\nThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up\nto them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. \"Great and mighty son,\"\nsaid he, \"of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will\nnow try with my spear.\" \n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck\nthe shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed\non till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted\nout and said, \"You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand\nout for long, and the glory of the fight is mine.\" \n\nBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, \"You have missed, not hit,\nand before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you\nshall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.\" \n\nWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus's\nnose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the\nbronze point cut through the root of his to tongue, coming out under\nhis chin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he\nfell heavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and\nhe was reft of life and strength. \n\nAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing\nlest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion\nin the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before him and\na cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should\ndare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so\nhuge and great that as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless\nhe bore it aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas\non the groin where the hip turns in the joint that is called the \"cup-bone.\"\nThe stone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its\njagged edges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees,\nand propped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness\nof night fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have\nperished then and there, had not his mother, Jove's daughter Venus,\nwho had conceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been\nquick to mark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her\ndear son. She protected him by covering him with a fold of her own\nfair garment, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast\nand kill him. \n\nThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son\nof Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given\nhim. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding\nthe reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas's\nhorses and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he\nhad so done he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom\nhe valued above all others as the one who was most like-minded with\nhimself, to take them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot,\nseized the reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of\nTydeus. \n\nNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear\nin hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses\nthat can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster\nof cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he\nflew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand.\nThe point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven\nfor her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her\nhand, so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins\nof the blessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do\nnot eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours,\nand are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but\nPhoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness,\nlest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him;\nand Diomed shouted out as he left her, \"Daughter of Jove, leave war\nand battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women?\nIf you meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder\nat the very name of war.\" \n\nThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the\nwind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all\nbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,\nwith his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon\nshe fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her\nhave his horses. \"Dear brother,\" she cried, \"save me, and give me\nyour horses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly\nwounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with\nfather Jove.\" \n\nThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She mounted\nthe chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her and\ntook the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew\nforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where\nthe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them\nfrom the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus\nflung herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms\nabout her and caressed her, saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings\nhas been treating you in this way, as though you had been doing something\nwrong in the face of day?\" \n\nAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, \"Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus,\nwounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best\nof all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between\nTrojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with\nthe immortals.\" \n\n\"Bear it, my child,\" replied Dione, \"and make the best of it. We dwellers\nin Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and we lay\nmuch suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and Ephialtes,\nchildren of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay thirteen\nmonths imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then perished\nhad not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told Mercury,\nwho stole him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by the severity\nof his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son of Amphitryon\nwounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed arrow, and nothing\ncould assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same man,\nthe son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an arrow even at the gates\nof hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove\non great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the arrow in his brawny\nshoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon healed him by spreading\nsoothing herbs on the wound, for Hades was not of mortal mould. Daring,\nhead-strong, evildoer who recked not of his sin in shooting the gods\nthat dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus\non against yourself, fool that he is for not reflecting that no man\nwho fights with gods will live long or hear his children prattling\nabout his knees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of\nTydeus see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger\nthan you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus,\nrouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her wedded\nlord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.\" \n\nSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with\nboth hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But\nMinerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their\nmocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak. \"Father Jove,\" said\nshe, \"do not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been\npersuading some one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of\nwhom she is so very fond, and while caressing one or other of them\nshe must have torn her delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman's\nbrooch.\" \n\nThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his side.\n\"My child,\" said he, \"it has not been given you to be a warrior. Attend,\nhenceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and leave all\nthis fighting to Mars and to Minerva.\" \n\nThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he knew\nhim to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the\nmighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his\narmour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him,\nand thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming\non for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to\nhim with an awful voice and said, \"Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw\noff; think not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the\nearth cannot hold their own with the immortals.\" \n\nThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger\nof the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him\nin sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty\nsanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold,\nwhile Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness\nof Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans\nhacked at the bucklers about one another's breasts, hewing each other's\nround shields and light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo\nsaid to Mars, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities,\ncan you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight\neven with father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went\nup to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and\nafterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god.\"\n\nHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars\nwent about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the\nlikeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. \"Sons of Priam,\"\nsaid he, \"how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by\nthe Achaeans? Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas\nthe son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour\nas Hector himself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from\nthe stress of the fight.\" \n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon\nrebuked Hector very sternly. \"Hector,\" said he, \"where is your prowess\nnow? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies\nyou could hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law.\nI see not one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it\nis we, your allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come\nfrom afar, even from Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where\nI have left my wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever\nis needy; nevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground\nagainst any who would fight me though I have nothing here for the\nAchaeans to plunder, while you look on, without even bidding your\nmen stand firm in defence of their wives. See that you fall not into\nthe hands of your foes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they\nsack your fair city forthwith. Keep this before your mind night and\nday, and beseech the captains of your allies to hold on without flinching,\nand thus put away their reproaches from you.\" \n\nSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang from\nhis chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host\nbrandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising\nthe terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the\nAchaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven\nback. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor,\nwhen men are winnowing- while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to\nsift the chaff from the grain, and the chaff- heaps grow whiter and\nwhiter- even so did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses'\nhoofs raised to the firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them\nback to battle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce\nMars, to help the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and\nwent about everywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told\nhim that when he saw Pallas, Minerva leave the fray he was to put\ncourage into the hearts of the Trojans- for it was she who was helping\nthe Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary,\nand filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his place among\nhis comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of\na good courage; but they could not ask him how it had all happened,\nfor they were too busy with the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife,\nwho raged insatiably in their midst. \n\nThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless\nof the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds\nwhich the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there\nis no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds\nwhose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions- even so\ndid the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The\nson of Atreus went about among them and exhorted them. \"My friends,\"\nsaid he, \"quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one\nanother's eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour\nmore often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life\nnor name.\" \n\nAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the\nfront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the\nTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was\never quick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King\nAgamemnon struck his shield and went right through it, for the shield\nstayed it not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his\nbelly, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to\nthe ground. \n\nThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and Orsilochus.\nTheir father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of Phere\nand was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream flows\nthrough the land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who ruled\nover much people and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat\ntwin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of\nwar. These, when they grew up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet\nin the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they\nboth of them fell. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths\nof some mountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep\nand cattle till they get killed by the hand of man, so were these\ntwo vanquished by Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the ground.\n\nBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the\nfront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars\negged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas;\nbut Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing\nthat the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour to\nnothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands\nand spears against one another eager to do battle, Antilochus placed\nhimself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though he was, drew\nback on seeing the two heroes side by side in front of him, so they\ndrew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans\nand committed the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades.\nThey then turned back and fought in the front ranks. \n\nThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian warriors.\nMenelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on his chariot,\nwhile Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the son of Atymnius,\nwho was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with a stone upon\nthe elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell from his\nhands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck him\non the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the\nchariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and\nshoulders buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soil\ntill his horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus\nlashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.\n\nBut Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry\nrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.\nMars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil\nof battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now\nin front of Hector and now behind him. \n\nDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide\nplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river\nrolling swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts\nback in fear- even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said\nto his men, \"My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the\nspear so well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now\nMars is with him in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore\ntowards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight\nwith gods.\" \n\nAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,\nboth in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in\nwar. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close\nup and hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man\nof great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land,\nbut his lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons.\nAjax struck him in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his\nbelly, and he fell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him\nto strip him of his armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him,\nmany of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel upon the body\nand drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him\nthat he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The\nTrojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with\ntheir spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant\nthough he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.\n\nThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong\nhand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both\nbrave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and\ngrandson of great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke\nfirst. \"Sarpedon,\" said he, \"councillor of the Lycians, why should\nyou come skulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call\nyou son of aegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were\nof old his children. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted\nfather, who came here for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had\nsix ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius\nand made a wilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your\npeople are falling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming\nfrom Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates\nof Hades vanquished by my hand.\" \n\nAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, \"Tlepolemus, your\nfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon's folly in refusing payment\nto one who had served him well. He would not give your father the\nhorses which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you shall\nmeet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\" \n\nThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw\nat the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his\nthroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell\nupon his eyes. Tlepolemus's spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh\nwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone,\nbut his father as yet warded off destruction from him. \n\nHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the\nweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in\nsuch haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing\nthe spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile\nthe Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was\nmoved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted\nwhether to pursue the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian\nrank and file; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the\nson of Jove; Minerva, therefore, turned him against the main body\nof the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus,\nHalius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not\ngreat Hector marked him, and sped to the front of the fight clad in\nhis suit of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad\nwhen he saw him coming, and besought him, saying, \"Son of Priam, let\nme not he here to fall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and\nsince I may not return home to gladden the hearts of my wife and of\nmy infant son, let me die within the walls of your city.\"\n\nHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon\nthe Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon\naway and laid him beneath Jove's spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his\nfriend and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted\nand a mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again,\nfor the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new\nlife, and brought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.\n\nMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Mars\nand Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars\nwas with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned\ntowards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by\nMars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned\ncharioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son\nof Oenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed\nof great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians\nwho lived near him, owners of a fertile country. \n\nNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said to\nMinerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the promise\nwe made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked the\ncity of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars rage thus furiously.\nLet us go into the fray at once.\" \n\nMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter\nof great Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe\nwith all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were\non either side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were\nof gold, imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze,\nwondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round\nthe axle upon either side. The car itself was made with plaited bands\nof gold and silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round\nit. From the body of the car there went a pole of silver, on to the\nend of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that\nwere to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno put her steeds\nunder the yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry. \n\nMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with\nher own hands, on to her father's threshold, and donned the shirt\nof Jove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis\nabout. her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and\non it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold;\nmoreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim and\nawful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set\nher helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both in\nfront and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; then\nshe stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout\nand sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who\nhave displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven\nbellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates over which the\nflours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open\nthe dense cloud that hides them, or to close it. Through these the\ngoddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found the son of Saturn\nsitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed\nher horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn, lord of all. \"Father\nJove,\" said she, \"are you not angry with Mars for these high doings?\nhow great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has destroyed to my\ngreat grief, and without either right or reason, while the Cyprian\nand Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and setting this unrighteous\nmadman on to do further mischief. I hope, Father Jove, that you will\nnot be angry if I hit Mars hard, and chase him out of the battle.\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more\noften than any one else does.\" \n\nJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward\nnothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see\nwhen he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the\nloud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they\nreached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois and\nScamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot.\nShe hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up\nfor them to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves\nin their eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part\nwhere the bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed,\nfighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance,\nthere Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced\nStentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together. \"Argives,\"\nshe cried; \"shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only;\nas long as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear was so deadly that\nthe Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates,\nbut now they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships.\"\n\nWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva\nsprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his chariot\nand horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For the\nsweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield irritated\nthe hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up the strap\nto wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his\nhorses and said, \"The son of Tydeus is not such another as his father.\nTydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into\nthe fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went all unattended\nas envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade him feast\nin their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit which was\never present with him, he challenged the youth of the Cadmeans, and\nat once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily did I help\nhim. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be instant in\nfighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or you are afraid\nand out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no true son\nof Tydeus the son of Oeneus.\" \n\nDiomed answered, \"I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove,\nand will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart,\nnor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your own instructions;\nyou told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if Jove's daughter\nVenus came into battle I was to wound her with my spear. Therefore\nI am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather in this place,\nfor I know that Mars is now lording it in the field.\" \n\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus,\" replied Minerva, \"man after my own heart,\nfear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend\nyou. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear\nnot this raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then\non the other. But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying\nhe would help the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he\nis with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.\" \n\nWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot\non to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the\ngoddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed.\nThe oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess\nand the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight\nat Mars. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius\nand bravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his\narmour, and Minerva donned the helmet of Hades, that he might not\nsee her; when, therefore, he saw Diomed, he made straight for him\nand let Periphas lie where he had fallen. As soon as they were at\nclose quarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and\nyoke, thinking to take Diomed's life, but Minerva caught the spear\nin her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then\nthrew, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars's stomach\nwhere his under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing\nhis fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as\nloudly as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the\nAchaeans and Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry\nhe raised. \n\nAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even\nso did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens.\nWith all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great\npain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal\nblood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying,\n\"Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are continually\nsuffering in the most cruel manner at one another's hands while helping\nmortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad\ntermagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of some\nkind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you neither\nscold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature\nis your daughter. See how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent\nhis rage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian and\nwounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me\ntoo as though he were a god. Had I not run for it I must either have\nlain there for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpes, or\nhave been eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left\nin me.\" \n\nJove looked angrily at him and said, \"Do not come whining here, Sir\nFacing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for\nyou are ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable\nand stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage\nher, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I\ncannot let you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own off-spring,\nand it was by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you\nhad been the son of any other god, you are so destructive that by\nthis time you should have been lying lower than the Titans.\"\n\nHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing herbs\nupon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As the\njuice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though\nit is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then\nHebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his\nseat by his father Jove all glorious to behold. \n\nBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put\na stop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house\nof Jove. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VI\n\nThe fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it\nwould, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain\nas they aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the\nstreams of Simois and Xanthus. \n\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke\na phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades\nby killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians,\nbeing both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting\npeak of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead\ninto the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes. \n\nThen Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived\nin the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had\na house by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit\nnot one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomed\nkilled both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his charioteer-\nso the pair passed beneath the earth. \n\nEuryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of\nAesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to noble\nBucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard.\nWhile tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and she conceived\ntwin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and he stripped the\narmour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killed Astyalus, Ulysses\nPidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fell by the spear\nof Nestor's son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men, killed Elatus\nwho dwelt in Pedasus by the banks of the river Satnioeis. Leitus killed\nPhylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus slew Melanthus.\n\nThen Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his horses\nran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the plain,\nand broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the city along\nwith the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out, and fell\nin the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot; Menelaus\ncame up to him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him by the knees\nbegging for his life. \"Take me alive,\" he cried, \"son of Atreus, and\nyou shall have a full ransom for me: my father is rich and has much\ntreasure of gold, bronze, and wrought iron laid by in his house. From\nthis store he will give you a large ransom should he hear of my being\nalive and at the ships of the Achaeans.\" \n\nThus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to\na squire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon came\nrunning up to him and rebuked him. \"My good Menelaus,\" said he, \"this\nis no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so well\nat the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of them-\nnot even the child unborn and in its mother's womb; let not a man\nof them be left alive, but let all in Ilius perish, unheeded and forgotten.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his words\nwere just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him, whereon\nKing Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then the son\nof Atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his spear from\nthe body. \n\nMeanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, \"My friends, Danaan\nwarriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead,\nand bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we\ncan; the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them\nlater at your leisure.\" \n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the\nTrojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had not\nPriam's son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas,\n\"Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the Trojans and Lycians,\nfor you are foremost at all times, alike in fight and counsel; hold\nyour ground here, and go about among the host to rally them in front\nof the gates, or they will fling themselves into the arms of their\nwives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you have put heart\ninto all our companies, we will stand firm here and fight the Danaans\nhowever hard they press us, for there is nothing else to be done.\nMeanwhile do you, Hector, go to the city and tell our mother what\nis happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the temple of\nMinerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and open the doors\nof the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva, let her\nlay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house- the one she sets\nmost store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelve yearling\nheifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of the goddess,\nif she will take pity on the town, with the wives and little ones\nof the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from falling on the goodly\ncity of Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men's souls with\npanic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not fear even their\ngreat champion Achilles, son of a goddess though he be, as we do this\nman: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with\nhim in prowess\" \n\nHector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot, and\nwent about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears, urging\nthe men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle. Thereon\nthey rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave ground and ceased\ntheir murderous onset, for they deemed that some one of the immortals\nhad come down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, so strangely\nhad they rallied. And Hector shouted to the Trojans, \"Trojans and\nallies, be men, my friends, and fight with might and main, while I\ngo to Ilius and tell the old men of our council and our wives to pray\nto the gods and vow hecatombs in their honour.\" \n\nWith this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went round\nhis shield beat against his neck and his ancles. \n\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into the\nopen space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When they\nwere close up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first\nto speak. \"Who, my good sir,\" said he, \"who are you among men? I have\nnever seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond all\nothers if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face\nmy might. If, however, you are one of the immortals and have come\ndown from heaven, I will not fight you; for even valiant Lycurgus,\nson of Dryas, did not live long when he took to fighting with the\ngods. He it was that drove the nursing women who were in charge of\nfrenzied Bacchus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi\non the ground as murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus\nhimself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him\nto her bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which\nthe man reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry\nwith Lycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he live\nmuch longer after he had become hateful to the immortals. Therefore\nI will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them that\neat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your doom.\"\n\nAnd the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me of\nmy lineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees.\nThose of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring returns\nthe forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the generations\nof mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away. If, then,\nyou would learn my descent, it is one that is well known to many.\nThere is a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land of horses, called\nEphyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind.\nHe was the son of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus, who was father\nto Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing comeliness\nand beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and being stronger than\nhe, drove him from the land of the Argives, over which Jove had made\nhim ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted after him, and would\nhave had him lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honourable\nman and would not, so she told lies about him to Proteus. 'Proetus,'\nsaid she, 'kill Bellerophon or die, for he would have had converse\nwith me against my will.' The king was angered, but shrank from killing\nBellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia with lying letters of introduction,\nwritten on a folded tablet, and containing much ill against the bearer.\nHe bade Bellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the\nend that he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia,\nand the gods convoyed him safely. \n\n\"When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king received\nhim with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nine heifers\nin his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the tenth\nday, he questioned him and desired to see the letter from his son-in-law\nProetus. When he had received the wicked letter he first commanded\nBellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera, who was not\na human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of a lion and the\ntail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, and she breathed\nforth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he was guided\nby signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famed Solymi, and this,\nhe said, was the hardest of all his battles. Thirdly, he killed the\nAmazons, women who were the peers of men, and as he was returning\nthence the king devised yet another plan for his destruction; he picked\nthe bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed them in ambuscade, but\nnot a man ever came back, for Bellerophon killed every one of them.\nThen the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of a god,\nso he kept him in Lycia, gave him his daughter in marriage, and made\nhim of equal honour in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave\nhim a piece of land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards\nand tilled fields, to have and to hold. \n\n\"The king's daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander, Hippolochus,\nand Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay with Laodameia, and\nshe bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon came to be hated\nby all the gods, he wandered all desolate and dismayed upon the Alean\nplain, gnawing at his own heart, and shunning the path of man. Mars,\ninsatiate of battle, killed his son Isander while he was fighting\nthe Solymi; his daughter was killed by Diana of the golden reins,\nfor she was angered with her; but Hippolochus was father to myself,\nand when he sent me to Troy he urged me again and again to fight ever\namong the foremost and outvie my peers, so as not to shame the blood\nof my fathers who were the noblest in Ephyra and in all Lycia. This,\nthen, is the descent I claim.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted his\nspear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. \"Then,\"\nhe said, you are an old friend of my father's house. Great Oeneus\nonce entertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchanged\npresents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon a double\ncup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do not remember\nTydeus, for he was taken from us while I was yet a child, when the\narmy of the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes. Henceforth,\nhowever, I must be your host in middle Argos, and you mine in Lycia,\nif I should ever go there; let us avoid one another's spears even\nduring a general engagement; there are many noble Trojans and allies\nwhom I can kill, if I overtake them and heaven delivers them into\nmy hand; so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whose lives\nyou may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour, that\nall present may know of the old ties that subsist between us.\"\n\nWith these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one another's\nhands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn made Glaucus\ntake leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour for bronze,\nthe worth of a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.\n\nNow when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wives\nand daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to ask after\ntheir sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set about\npraying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.\n\nPresently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned with\ncolonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers- all\nof hewn stone- built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept,\neach with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side the courtyard,\nthere were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for Priam's daughters,\nbuilt near one another, where his sons-in-law slept with their wives.\nWhen Hector got there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodice\nthe fairest of her daughters. She took his hand within her own and\nsaid, \"My son, why have you left the battle to come hither? Are the\nAchaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about the city that you\nhave thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jove from the citadel?\nWait till I can bring you wine that you may make offering to Jove\nand to the other immortals, and may then drink and be refreshed. Wine\ngives a man fresh strength when he is wearied, as you now are with\nfighting on behalf of your kinsmen.\" \n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unman\nme and I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering to Jove\nwith unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and filth may\nnot pray to the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, and go with\nofferings to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there, upon\nthe knees of Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in\nyour house- the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to sacrifice\ntwelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the\ntemple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, with the\nwives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from\noff the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights with fury, and fills men's\nsouls with panic. Go, then, to the temple of Minerva, while I seek\nParis and exhort him, if he will hear my words. Would that the earth\nmight open her jaws and swallow him, for Jove bred him to be the bane\nof the Trojans, and of Priam and Priam's sons. Could I but see him\ngo down into the house of Hades, my heart would forget its heaviness.\"\n\nHis mother went into the house and called her waiting-women who gathered\nthe matrons throughout the city. She then went down into her fragrant\nstore-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, the work of Sidonian\nwomen, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidon when he sailed\nthe seas upon that voyage during which he carried off Helen. Hecuba\ntook out the largest robe, and the one that was most beautifully enriched\nwith embroidery, as an offering to Minerva: it glittered like a star,\nand lay at the very bottom of the chest. With this she went on her\nway and many matrons with her. \n\nWhen they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter of\nCisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojans had\nmade her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their hands to\nthe goddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay it upon\nthe knees of Minerva, praying the while to the daughter of great Jove.\n\"Holy Minerva,\" she cried, \"protectress of our city, mighty goddess,\nbreak the spear of Diomed and lay him low before the Scaean gates.\nDo this, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers that have never yet\nknown the goad, in your temple, if you will have pity upon the town,\nwith the wives and little ones If the Trojans.\" Thus she prayed, but\nPallas Minerva granted not her prayer. \n\nWhile they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hector\nwent to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built for him by\nthe foremost builders in the land. They had built him his house, storehouse,\nand courtyard near those of Priam and Hector on the acropolis. Here\nHector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in his hand; the bronze\npoint gleamed in front of him, and was fastened to the shaft of the\nspear by a ring of gold. He found Alexandrus within the house, busied\nabout his armour, his shield and cuirass, and handling his curved\nbow; there, too, sat Argive Helen with her women, setting them their\nseveral tasks; and as Hector saw him he rebuked him with words of\nscorn. \"Sir,\" said he, \"you do ill to nurse this rancour; the people\nperish fighting round this our town; you would yourself chide one\nwhom you saw shirking his part in the combat. Up then, or ere long\nthe city will be in a blaze.\" \n\nAnd Alexandrus answered, \"Hector, your rebuke is just; listen therefore,\nand believe me when I tell you that I am not here so much through\nrancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire to indulge\nmy grief. My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, and I hold\nit better that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait, then,\nwhile I put on my armour, or go first and I will follow. I shall be\nsure to overtake you.\" \n\nHector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. \"Brother,\" said\nshe, \"to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind had caught\nme up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had borne me to some\nmountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that should have swept\nme away ere this mischief had come about. But, since the gods have\ndevised these evils, would, at any rate, that I had been wife to a\nbetter man- to one who could smart under dishonour and men's evil\nspeeches. This fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nor never\nwill be, and he will surely reap what he has sown. Still, brother,\ncome in and rest upon this seat, for it is you who bear the brunt\nof that toil that has been caused by my hateful self and by the sin\nof Alexandrus- both of whom Jove has doomed to be a theme of song\namong those that shall be born hereafter.\" \n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all the goodwill\nyou bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the Trojans, who\nmiss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge your husband, and\nof his own self also let him make haste to overtake me before I am\nout of the city. I must go home to see my household, my wife and my\nlittle son, for I know not whether I shall ever again return to them,\nor whether the gods will cause me to fill by the hands of the Achaeans.\"\n\nThen Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did not\nfind Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of\nher maids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within,\nhe stood on the threshold of the women's rooms and said, \"Women, tell\nme, and tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the house?\nWas it to my sisters, or to my brothers' wives? or is she at the temple\nof Minerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?\"\n\nHis good housekeeper answered, \"Hector, since you bid me tell you\ntruly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers' wives,\nnor yet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiating\nthe awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she had\nheard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeans were\nin great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the nurse\nwent with her carrying the child.\" \n\nHector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went\ndown the streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gone\nthrough the city and had reached the Scaean gates through which he\nwould go out on to the plain, his wife came running towards him, Andromache,\ndaughter of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe under the wooded slopes\nof Mt. Placus, and was king of the Cilicians. His daughter had married\nHector, and now came to meet him with a nurse who carried his little\nchild in her bosom- a mere babe. Hector's darling son, and lovely\nas a star. Hector had named him Scamandrius, but the people called\nhim Astyanax, for his father stood alone as chief guardian of Ilius.\nHector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak, and\nAndromache stood by him weeping and taking his hand in her own. \"Dear\nhusband,\" said she, \"your valour will bring you to destruction; think\non your infant son, and on my hapless self who ere long shall be your\nwidow- for the Achaeans will set upon you in a body and kill you.\nIt would be better for me, should I lose you, to lie dead and buried,\nfor I shall have nothing left to comfort me when you are gone, save\nonly sorrow. I have neither father nor mother now. Achilles slew my\nfather when he sacked Thebe the goodly city of the Cilicians. He slew\nhim, but did not for very shame despoil him; when he had burned him\nin his wondrous armour, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the\nmountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, planted a grove\nof elms about his tomb. I had seven brothers in my father's house,\nbut on the same day they all went within the house of Hades. Achilles\nkilled them as they were with their sheep and cattle. My mother- her\nwho had been queen of all the land under Mt. Placus- he brought hither\nwith the spoil, and freed her for a great sum, but the archer- queen\nDiana took her in the house of your father. Nay- Hector- you who to\nme are father, mother, brother, and dear husband- have mercy upon\nme; stay here upon this wall; make not your child fatherless, and\nyour wife a widow; as for the host, place them near the fig-tree,\nwhere the city can be best scaled, and the wall is weakest. Thrice\nhave the bravest of them come thither and assailed it, under the two\nAjaxes, Idomeneus, the sons of Atreus, and the brave son of Tydeus,\neither of their own bidding, or because some soothsayer had told them.\"\n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Wife, I too have thought upon all this, but\nwith what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if I\nshirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save\nto fight bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown\nalike for my father and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely\ncome when mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam's people,\nbut I grieve for none of these- not even for Hecuba, nor King Priam,\nnor for my brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust before\ntheir foes- for none of these do I grieve as for yourself when the\nday shall come on which some one of the Achaeans shall rob you for\never of your freedom, and bear you weeping away. It may be that you\nwill have to ply the loom in Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or\nto fetch water from the springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutally\nby some cruel task-master; then will one say who sees you weeping,\n'She was wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojans during\nthe war before Ilius.' On this your tears will break forth anew for\nhim who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May I lie\ndead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hear your\ncry as they carry you into bondage.\" \n\nHe stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and nestled\nin his nurse's bosom, scared at the sight of his father's armour,\nand at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his helmet.\nHis father and mother laughed to see him, but Hector took the helmet\nfrom his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground. Then he took\nhis darling child, kissed him, and dandled him in his arms, praying\nover him the while to Jove and to all the gods. \"Jove,\" he cried,\n\"grant that this my child may be even as myself, chief among the Trojans;\nlet him be not less excellent in strength, and let him rule Ilius\nwith his might. Then may one say of him as he comes from battle, 'The\nson is far better than the father.' May he bring back the blood-stained\nspoils of him whom he has laid low, and let his mother's heart be\nglad.'\" \n\nWith this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who took\nhim to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As her husband\nwatched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed her fondly,\nsaying, \"My own wife, do not take these things too bitterly to heart.\nNo one can hurry me down to Hades before my time, but if a man's hour\nis come, be he brave or be he coward, there is no escape for him when\nhe has once been born. Go, then, within the house, and busy yourself\nwith your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering\nof your servants; for war is man's matter, and mine above all others\nof them that have been born in Ilius.\" \n\nHe took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back\nagain to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towards\nhim. When she reached her home she found her maidens within, and bade\nthem all join in her lament; so they mourned Hector in his own house\nthough he was yet alive, for they deemed that they should never see\nhim return safe from battle, and from the furious hands of the Achaeans.\n\nParis did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly armour\noverlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast as his feet\ncould take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and gallops\ngloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to bathe in\nthe fair-flowing river- he holds his head high, and his mane streams\nupon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies like the\nwind to the haunts and feeding ground of the mares- even so went forth\nParis from high Pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in his armour, and\nhe laughed aloud as he sped swiftly on his way. Forthwith he came\nupon his brother Hector, who was then turning away from the place\nwhere he had held converse with his wife, and he was himself the first\nto speak. \"Sir,\" said he, \"I fear that I have kept you waiting when\nyou are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you bade me.\"\n\n\"My good brother,\" answered Hector, you fight bravely, and no man\nwith any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But you\nare careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear\nthe ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have suffered much\non your account. Let us be going, and we will make things right hereafter,\nshould Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of our deliverance before\never-living gods of heaven in our own homes, when we have chased the\nAchaeans from Troy.\" \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VII\n\nWith these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother\nAlexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends\na breeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have\nlaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so welcome\nwas the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans. \n\nThereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he lived\nin Ame, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of Phylomedusa.\nHector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in\nthe neck under the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaucus, moreover, son\nof Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight\nsmote Iphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as he was springing\non to his chariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell to earth from\nthe car, and there was no life left in him. \n\nWhen, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the Argives,\nshe darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, and Apollo,\nwho was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he wanted\nthe Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and King\nApollo son of Jove was first to speak. \"What would you have said he,\n\"daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hither\nfrom Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline\nthe scales of victory in favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade you-\nfor it will be better thus- stay the combat for to-day, but let them\nrenew the fight hereafter till they compass the doom of Ilius, since\nyou goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.\"\n\nAnd Minerva answered, \"So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind that\nI came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me, then,\nhow do you propose to end this present fighting?\" \n\nApollo, son of Jove, replied, \"Let us incite great Hector to challenge\nsome one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the Achaeans will\nbe shamed into finding a man who will fight him.\" \n\nMinerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of\nthe gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, \"Hector son of\nPriam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then persuade\nyou. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats,\nand challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you in single\ncombat. I have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour\nof your doom is not yet come.\" \n\nHector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the Trojans,\ngrasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and they all sat\ndown. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But Minerva and\nApollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father Jove's high\noak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together,\nbristling with shield and helmet and spear. As when the rising west\nwind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow dark beneath it,\nso sat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector\nspoke thus:- \n\n\"Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded;\nJove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to nothing,\nand foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers\nof Troy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The princes of\nthe Achaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him, then,\nthat will fight me stand forward as your champion against Hector.\nThus I say, and may Jove be witness between us. If your champion slay\nme, let him strip me of my armour and take it to your ships, but let\nhim send my body home that the Trojans and their wives may give me\nmy dues of fire when I am dead. In like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe\nme glory and I slay your champion, I will strip him of his armour\nand take it to the city of Ilius, where I will hang it in the temple\nof Apollo, but I will give up his body, that the Achaeans may bury\nhim at their ships, and the build him a mound by the wide waters of\nthe Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sails his ship over\nthe sea, 'This is the monument of one who died long since a champion\nwho was slain by mighty Hector.' Thus will one say, and my fame shall\nnot be lost.\" \n\nThus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline\nthe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus rose\nand rebuked them, for he was angry. \"Alas,\" he cried, \"vain braggarts,\nwomen forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon\nus if no man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned\nevery man of you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious\nin your places. I will myself go out against this man, but the upshot\nof the fight will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.\"\n\nWith these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your\nlife would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for\nhe was far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung\nupon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand\nand said, \"Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient\nin spite of passion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger\nthan yourself as Hector son of Priam, who is feared by many another\nas well as you. Even Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are,\nshrank from meeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the\nAchaeans will send some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and\nfond of battle though he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under\nhim if he comes out alive from the hurly-burly of this fight.\"\n\nWith these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother, whereon\nhis squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders. Then\nNestor rose and spoke, \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"the Achaean land is\nfallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and orator\namong the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to question me\nconcerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How would it not\ngrieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before Hector? Many\na time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave\nhis body and go down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove,\nMinerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the\nPylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon\nunder the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river\nIardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their champion,\nwith the armour of King Areithous upon his shoulders- Areithous whom\nmen and women had surnamed 'the Mace-man,' because he fought neither\nwith bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron\nmace. Lycurgus killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him\nin a narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus\nwas too quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell\nto earth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which\nMars had given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when\nhe grew old and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire\nEreuthalion, who in this same armour challenged the foremost men among\nus. The others quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade me fight\nhim though none other would venture; I was the youngest man of them\nall; but when I fought him Minerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the\nbiggest and strongest man that ever I killed, and covered much ground\nas he lay sprawling upon the earth. Would that I were still young\nand strong as I then was, for the son of Priam would then soon find\none who would face him. But you, foremost among the whole host though\nyou be, have none of you any stomach for fighting Hector.\"\n\nThus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started to\ntheir feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him brave\nDiomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in\nvalour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his brother\nin arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of Andraemon,\nand Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor knight of Gerene again spoke, saying:\n\"Cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. If he come alive\nout of this fight he will have done good service alike to his own\nsoul and to the Achaeans.\" \n\nThus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrown\nit into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people lifted their\nhands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into\nthe vault of heaven, \"Father Jove, grant that the lot fall on Ajax,\nor on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene himself.\"\n\nAs they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and\nfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted- the lot of Ajax.\nThe herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the\nAchaeans, going from left to right; but they none of of them owned\nit. When, however, in due course he reached the man who had written\nupon it and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand,\nand the herald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw him mark he knew it\nand was glad; he threw it to the ground and said, \"My friends, the\nlot is mine, and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put\non my armour; meanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves\nthat the Trojans may not hear you- or aloud if you will, for we fear\nno man. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for\nI was born and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.\"\n\nWith this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus\nwould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, \"Father\nJove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory\nto Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector\nalso and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess.\n\nThus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming bronze.\nWhen he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Mars when\nhe takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with one another-\neven so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring forward with\na grim smile on his face as he brandished his long spear and strode\nonward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but the Trojans\ntrembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector beat quickly,\nbut he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks behind him,\nfor he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his shield in\nfront of him like a wall- a shield of bronze with seven folds of oxhide-\nthe work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the best worker\nin leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full-fed bulls,\nand over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding this\nshield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector, and\nmenaced him saying, \"Hector, you shall now learn, man to man, what\nkind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted\nAchilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in\nanger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of\nus who are well able to face you; therefore begin the fight.\"\n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the host,\ntreat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot fight.\nI have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. I am\nquick to turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this\nI deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots and\nhorsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Mars;\nhowbeit I would not take such a man as you are off his guard- but\nI will smite you openly if I can.\" \n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck\nthe sevenfold shield in its outermost layer- the eighth, which was\nof bronze- and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide\nit stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield\nof the son of Priam. The terrible spear went through his gleaming\nshield, and pressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship;\nit pierced the shirt against his side, but he swerved and thus saved\nhis life. They then each of them drew out the spear from his shield,\nand fell on one another like savage lions or wild boars of great strength\nand endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax's shield,\nbut the bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned.\nAjax then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear\nwent through it and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack;\nit gashed his neck and the blood came pouring from the wound, but\neven so Hector did not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with his\nbrawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the\nplain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax on the boss that was\nin its middle, so that the bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught\nup a far larger stone, swung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious\nforce. This millstone of a rock broke Hector's shield inwards and\nthrew him down on his back with the shield crushing him under it,\nbut Apollo raised him at once. Thereon they would have hacked at one\nanother in close combat with their swords, had not heralds, messengers\nof gods and men, come forward, one from the Trojans and the other\nfrom the Achaeans- Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable men;\nthese parted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said,\n\"My sons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both are\ndear to Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the behests\nof night may not be well gainsaid.\" \n\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \"Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was\nhe that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will accept\nhis saying.\" \n\nThen Hector said, \"Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and strength,\nand judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all others of the\nAchaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will fight\nanew till heaven decide between us, and give victory to one or to\nthe other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not\nbe well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your\nships, and more especially those of your own followers and clansmen,\nwhile I, in the great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans\nand their women, who vie with one another in their prayers on my behalf.\nLet us, moreover, exchange presents that it may be said among the\nAchaeans and Trojans, 'They fought with might and main, but were reconciled\nand parted in friendship.' \n\nOn this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and leathern\nbaldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with purple. Thus\nthey parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans, and the other\nto that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their hero come\nto them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty Ajax. They\nled him, therefore, to the city as one that had been saved beyond\ntheir hopes. On the other side the Achaeans brought Ajax elated with\nvictory to Agamemnon. \n\nWhen they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon sacrificed\nfor them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son of Saturn.\nThey flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into joints;\nthese they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them on the\nspits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off. When\nthey had done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it, and\nevery man had his full and equal share, so that all were satisfied,\nand King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin,\nas a mark of special honour. As soon as they had had enough to cat\nand drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak;\nwith all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-\n\n\"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the Achaeans\nare now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the Scamander,\nand their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it will be well\nwhen morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheel\nour dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from the\nships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades\nhome to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow\nthat shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let\nus set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships,\nand let it have well-made gates that there may be a way through them\nfor our chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round\nit to keep off both horse and foot, that the Trojan chieftains may\nnot bear hard upon us.\" \n\nThus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the\nTrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis\nby the gates of King Priam's palace; and wise Antenor spoke. \"Hear\nme he said, \"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even\nas I am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the\nsons of Atreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn\ncovenants, and shall not prosper till we have done as I say.\"\n\nHe then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to speak.\n\"Antenor,\" said he, \"your words are not to my liking; you can find\na better saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken\nin good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason.\nI will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that I will\nnot give up the woman; but the wealth that I brought home with her\nfrom Argos I will restore, and will add yet further of my own.\"\n\nOn this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race\nof Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity\nand goodwill addressed them thus: \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and\nallies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now\nas hitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful.\nAt daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus\nsons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel\nhas come about; and let him also be instant with them that they now\ncease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew,\ntill heaven decide between us and give victory to one or to the other.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took supper\nin their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his wa to the ships.\nHe found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of\nAgamemnon's ship, and took his place in the midst of them. \"Son of\nAtreus,\" he said, \"and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the\nother noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus\nthrough whom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find\nit acceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships to Troy-\nwould that he had sooner perished- he will restore, and will add yet\nfurther of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife of Menelaus,\nthough the Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me inquire further\nif you will cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will\nfight anew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one\nor to the other.\" \n\nThey all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud war-cry\nspoke, saying, \"Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet\nHelen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at\nhand.\" \n\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed\nhad spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, \"Idaeus, you\nhave heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as\nconcerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are\nonce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let\nJove the mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant.\"\n\nAs he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, and\nIdaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and Dardanians\nwere gathered in council waiting his return; when he came, he stood\nin their midst and delivered his message. As soon as they heard it\nthey set about their twofold labour, some to gather the corpses, and\nothers to bring in wood. The Argives on their part also hastened from\ntheir ships, some to gather the corpses, and others to bring in wood.\n\nThe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into the\nvault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when\nthe two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they\nwashed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and lifted\nthem upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail aloud,\nso they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having\nburned them went back to the city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner\nheaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned\nthem went back to their ships. \n\nNow in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the\nAchaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was\nraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall\nto shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that\nthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and close outside\nit they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with\nstakes. \n\nThus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove\nthe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune,\nlord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, \"Father Jove, what mortal in\nthe whole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you\nnot how the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven\na trench all round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The\nThe fame of this wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will\nno longer think anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself\nbuilt with so much labour for Laomedon.\" \n\nJove was displeased and answered, \"What, O shaker of the earth, are\nyou talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed\nat what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself.\nSurely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships, you can\nshatter their wall and Ring it into the sea; you can cover the beach\nwith sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be utterly\neffaced.\" \n\nThus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was\ncompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their\nsupper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus\nthe son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted\nthem with ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to\nthe sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the Achaeans\nbought their wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides,\nsome with whole heifers, and some again with captives. They spread\na goodly banquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did\nthe Trojans and their allies in the city. But all the time Jove boded\nthem ill and roared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold\nupon them, and they spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground,\nnor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty\nson of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed\nthe boon of sleep. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VIII\n\nNow when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse\nlight over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmost\ncrest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave\near. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"gods and goddesses, that I may speak even\nas I am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross\nme, but obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an\nend. If I see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans,\nhe shall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to Olympus;\nor I will hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into the deepest pit\nunder the earth, where the gates are iron and the floor bronze, as\nfar beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may\nlearn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find out for\nyourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it\nall of you, gods and goddesses together- tug as you will, you will\nnot drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to earth; but were\nI to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and sea into\nthe bargain, then would I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus\nand leave you all dangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above\nall others either of gods or men.\" \n\nThey were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had\nspoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, \"Father, son of\nSaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be gainsaid,\nbut we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are perishing and\ncoming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain\nfrom actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to\nthe Argives that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\"\n\nJove smiled at her and answered, \"Take heart, my child, Trito-born;\nI am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you.\"\n\nWith this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes\nof glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about the body,\nseized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon he\nlashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt\nearth and starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained\nIda, mother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove and\nfragrant altar. There the father of gods and men stayed his horses,\ntook them from the chariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he\ntook his seat all glorious upon the topmost crests, looking down upon\nthe city of Troy and the ships of the Achaeans. \n\nThe Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and afterwards\nput on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewise armed\nthemselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless\neager perforce to do battle for their wives and children. All the\ngates were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with\nthe tramp as of a great multitude. \n\nWhen they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield,\nand spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty was\nthe din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another- death-\ncry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red\nwith blood. \n\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weapons\nbeat against one another, and the people fell, but when the sun had\nreached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden scales, and\nput two fates of death within them, one for the Trojans and the other\nfor the Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, and when he lifted\nit up the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught scale of the\nAchaeans settled down upon the ground, while that of the Trojans rose\nheavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the glare\nof his lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear\nfell upon them and they were sore afraid. \n\nIdomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two Ajaxes,\nservants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerene alone\nstood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but one\nof his horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had\nhit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins\nto grow away from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded\nin his anguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw\nothers into confusion. The old man instantly began cutting the traces\nwith his sword, but Hector's fleet horses bore down upon him through\nthe rout with their bold charioteer, even Hector himself, and the\nold man would have perished there and then had not Diomed been quick\nto mark, and with a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.\n\n\"Ulysses,\" he cried, \"noble son of Laertes where are you flying to,\nwith your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struck with\na spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend Nestor\nfrom this man's furious onset.\" \n\nUlysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the Achaeans,\nand the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the thick of the\nfight took his stand before the horses of the son of Neleus. \"Sir,\"\nsaid he, \"these young warriors are pressing you hard, your force is\nspent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught, and your\nhorses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what the horses\nof Tros can do- how cleverly they can scud hither and thither over\nthe plain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from the hero\nAeneas. Let our squires attend to your own steeds, but let us drive\nmine straight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn how furiously\nI too can wield my spear.\" \n\nNestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the doughty\nsquires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor's horses,\nwhile the two both mounted Diomed's chariot. Nestor took the reins\nin his hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up with\nHector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was charging\nfull speed towards them. He missed him, but struck his charioteer\nand squire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple\nwhile the reins were in his hands, so that he died there and then,\nand the horses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. Hector\nwas greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie\nfor all his sorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor\ndid his steeds have to go long without one, for he presently found\nbrave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind\nthe horses, giving the reins into his hand. \n\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have been\npenned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men been\nquick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just\nin front of Diomed's horses with a flare of burning brimstone. The\nhorses were frightened and tried to back beneath the car, while the\nreins dropped from Nestor's hands. Then he was afraid and said to\nDiomed, \"Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see you not that\nthe hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafes victory to Hector;\nto-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grant it to ourselves;\nno man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of Jove, for he is far\nstronger than any.\" \n\nDiomed answered, \"All that you have said is true; there is a grief\nhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk among\nthe Trojans and say, 'The son of Tydeus fled before me to the ships.'\nThis is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow me.\"\n\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Nestor, \"what mean you? Though Hector say\nthat you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe\nhim, nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.\"\n\nSo saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,\nand with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their\ndarts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, \"Son of Tydeus,\nthe Danaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at\ntable, the meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.\nHenceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than\na woman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale\nour walls through any Hinching upon my part; neither shall you carry\noff our wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand.\"\n\nThe son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his horses\nround again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice did Jove\nthunder from the heights of. Ida in token to the Trojans that he would\nturn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted to them and said,\n\"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be men,\nmy friends, and fight with might and with main; I see that Jove is\nminded to vouchsafe victory and great glory to myself, while he will\ndeal destruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building\nthis weak and worthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses\nwill spring lightly over their trench, and when I am at their ships\nforget not to bring me fire that I may burn them, while I slaughter\nthe Argives who will be all dazed and bewildered by the smoke.\"\n\nThen he cried to his horses, \"Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon\nand goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the honey-sweet\ncorn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has fed you, and\nfor she has mixed wine and water for you to drink whenever you would,\nbefore doing so even for me who am her own husband. Haste in pursuit,\nthat we may take the shield of Nestor, the fame of which ascends to\nheaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rods and all, and that we may\nstrip from the shoulders of Diomed. the cuirass which Vulcan made\nhim. Could we take these two things, the Achaeans would set sail in\ntheir ships this self-same night.\" \n\nThus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she shook\nwith rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god of Neptune,\n\"What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find no compassion\nin your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you many a welcome\noffering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then. If all of us\nwho are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back and keep Jove\nfrom helping them, he would have to sit there sulking alone on Ida.\"\n\nKing Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, \"Juno, rash of tongue,\nwhat are you talking about? We other gods must not set ourselves against\nJove, for he is far stronger than we are.\" \n\nThus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch,\nfrom the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and warriors,\nwho were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that the hand of\nJove was with him. He would even have set fire to the ships and burned\nthem, had not Queen Juno put it into the mind of Agamemnon, to bestir\nhimself and to encourage the Achaeans. To this end he went round the\nships and tents carrying a great purple cloak, and took his stand\nby the huge black hull of Ulysses' ship, which was middlemost of all;\nit was from this place that his voice would carry farthest, on the\none hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other\ntowards those of Achilles- for these two heroes, well assured of their\nown strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends\nof the line. From this spot then, with a voice that could be heard\nafar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying, \"Argives, shame on you cowardly\ncreatures, brave in semblance only; where are now our vaunts that\nwe should prove victorious- the vaunts we made so vaingloriously in\nLemnos, when we ate the flesh of horned cattle and filled our mixing-bowls\nto the brim? You vowed that you would each of you stand against a\nhundred or two hundred men, and now you prove no match even for one-\nfor Hector, who will be ere long setting our ships in a blaze. Father\nJove, did you ever so ruin a great king and rob him so utterly of\nhis greatness? yet, when to my sorrow I was coming hither, I never\nlet my ship pass your altars without offering the fat and thigh-bones\nof heifers upon every one of them, so eager was I to sack the city\nof Troy. Vouchsafe me then this prayer- suffer us to escape at any\nrate with our lives, and let not the Achaeans be so utterly vanquished\nby the Trojans.\" \n\nThus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him\nthat his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle,\nmost unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its\ntalons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the Achaeans\nsacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; When, therefore, the people\nsaw that the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely upon\nthe Trojans and fought more boldly. \n\nThere was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that\nhe had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight sooner\nthan the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he slew\nan armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon. He had\nturned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the back\nmidway between his shoulders and went right through his chest, and\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his chariot.\n\nAfter him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two Ajaxes\nclothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his companion in\narms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus the brave son\nof Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his place under\ncover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax lifted his shield\nTeucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng,\nthe man would fall dead; then Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child\nto its mother, and again duck down under his shield. \n\nWhich of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and\nthen Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike Lycophontes,\nAmopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. these in turn did he lay\nlow upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw him making\nhavoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him and said,\n\"Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain among the\nhost, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory\nof your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care of you in\nhis own house when you were a child, bastard though you were. Cover\nhim with glory though he is far off; I will promise and I will assuredly\nperform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me to sack the city\nof Ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after my own-\na tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who shall go\nup into your bed.\" \n\nAnd Teucer answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge\nme; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have never\nceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and\nkill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buried\nin the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit.\"\n\nAs he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was\nbent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit\nPriam's brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair Castianeira,\nlovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, and now he bowed\nhis head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed down by\nshowers in spring- even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight\nof his helmet. \n\nAgain he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again\nhis arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector's\nbrave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he\nwas driving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as\nhe fell headlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him.\nHector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for\nall his sorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother\nCebriones, who was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he had\nsaid. Hector thereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to the\nground, and seizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intent\nkill him. Teucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid\nit upon the bow-string, but Hector struck him with the jagged stone\nas he was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit\nhim just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, a\nvery deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his wrist\nwas less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward on\nhis knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and running towards\nhim bestrode him and sheltered him with his shield. Meanwhile his\ntwo trusty squires, Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, came up\nand bore him to the ships groaning in his great pain. \n\nJove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the Achaeans\nto their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their head. As\na hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he gives\nhim chase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did Hector\nfollow close upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as they\nrushed panic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set\nstakes and trench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the hands\nof the Trojans, they halted at their ships, calling upon one another\nand praying every man instantly as they lifted up their hands to the\ngods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring\nlike those of Gorgo or murderous Mars. \n\nJuno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to Minerva,\n\"Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take no more thought\nfor the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever do so? See\nhow they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of but a single\nman. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury, and has\nalready done great mischief.\" \n\nMinerva answered, \"Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his own\nland, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is\nmad with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets\nhow often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labours Eurystheus\nhad laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up to heaven, and\nthen Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the sense to\nforesee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of Hades,\nto fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come back\nalive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates\nme, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed his knees\nand took hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do honour\nto Achilles. I shall know what to do next time he begins calling me\nhis grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go within the\nhouse of aegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we shall then find\nout whether Priam's son Hector will be glad to meet us in the highways\nof battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds and vultures with\nthe fat of their flesh as they he dead by the ships of the Achaeans.\"\n\nThus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,\nobeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened steeds,\nwhile Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her richly vesture,\nmade with her own hands, on to the threshold of her father, and donned\nthe shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle. Then she stepped into\nher flaming chariot, and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and\nstrong with which she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased\nher. Juno lashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they\nflew open of their own accord- gates over which the Hours preside,\nin whose hands are heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud\nthat hides them or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove\ntheir obedient steeds. \n\nBut father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent\nwinged Iris with a message to them. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, turn\nthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to\nfighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this is what\nI mean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them\nfrom their chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them\nall ten years to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them;\nmy grey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her father\nmeans. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say\nshe always contradicts me.\" \n\nWith this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights of\nIda to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the\nouter gates of its many valleys and gave them her message. \"What,\"\nsaid she, \"are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbids going.\nThis is what he says, and this is he means to do, he will lame your\nhorses for you, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break\nit in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal the wounds his\nlightning will inflict upon you, that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess,\nwhat quarrelling with your father means. He is less hurt and angry\nwith Juno, for whatever he says she always contradicts him but you,\nbold bold hussy, will you really dare to raise your huge spear in\ndefiance of Jove?\" \n\nWith this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, \"Of a truth, child\nof aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men's battles further\nin defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have it, and\nlet Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans and Danaans according\nto his own pleasure.\" \n\nShe turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them\nfast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the\nend wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon their\ngolden thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were\nvery angry. \n\nPresently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered the\nassembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horses\nfor him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. Jove\nthen sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath him.\nMinerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spoke nor\nasked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said, \"Minerva\nand Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing so many\nof your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might\nof my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were\nboth of you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its\nterrible doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been-\nI should have struck you with lighting, and your chariots would never\nhave brought you back again to Olympus.\" \n\nMinerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and brooded\nmischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word, for she\nwas in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her father;\nbut Juno could not contain herself and said, \"What, dread son of Saturn,\nare you talking about? We know how great your power is, nevertheless\nwe have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are perishing and\ncoming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain\nfrom actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to\nthe Argives, that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,\nyou will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of the Argives,\nfor fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the\nson of Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships'\nsterns about the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is how it\nis decreed; for aught I care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath\nearth and sea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus with\nneither ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go\non and on till you get there, and I shall not care one whit for your\ndispleasure; you are the greatest vixen living.\" \n\nJuno made him no answer. The sun's glorious orb now sank into Oceanus\nand drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the Trojans when\nlight failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness\nfall upon the Achaeans. \n\nThen Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a council\non the open space near the river, where there was a spot ear corpses.\nThey left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speech\nhe made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze point\nof which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the spear-head\nwas of gold Spear in hand he spoke. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"Trojans,\nDardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I should destroy the\nships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back to Ilius, but\ndarkness came on too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their\nships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey the behests of\nnight, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots\nand give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep\nand cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your horses\nand gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires\nwhose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try to fly beyond\nthe sea by night, and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested;\nmany a man among them must take a dart with him to nurse at home,\nhit with spear or arrow as he is leaping on board his ship, that others\nmay fear to bring war and weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the\nheralds tell it about the city that the growing youths and grey-bearded\nmen are to camp upon its heaven-built walls. Let the women each of\nthem light a great fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept\nlest the town be entered by surprise while the host is outside. See\nto it, brave Trojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the\nmoment; at daybreak I will instruct you further. I pray in hope to\nJove and to the gods that we may then drive those fate-sped hounds\nfrom our land, for 'tis the fates that have borne them and their ships\nhither. This night, therefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning\nlet us put on our armour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the\nAchaeans; I shall then know whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus\nwill drive me back from the ships to the wall, or whether I shall\nmyself slay him and carry off his bloodstained spoils. To-morrow let\nhim show his mettle, abide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break\nof day, he shall be among the first to fall and many another of his\ncomrades round him. Would that I were as sure of being immortal and\nnever growing old, and of being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo,\nas I am that this day will bring evil to the Argives.\" \n\nThus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took their\nsweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each by his\nown chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the city,\nthey brought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered much\nwood. They then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals, and\nthe wind carried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven- but the\nblessed gods partook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Ilius with\nPriam and Priam's people. Thus high in hope they sat through the livelong\nnight by the highways of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle.\nAs when the stars shine clear, and the moon is bright- there is not\na breath of air, not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it\nstands out in the ineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of\nheaven; the stars can all of them be told and the heart of the shepherd\nis glad- even thus shone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilius\nmidway between the ships and the river Xanthus. A thousand camp-fires\ngleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each there sat fifty men,\nwhile the horses, champing oats and corn beside their chariots, waited\ntill dawn should come. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK IX\n\nThus did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stained Rout,\nhad taken fast hold of the Achaeans and their princes were all of\nthem in despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace- the\nnorth and the northwest- spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury\nof the main- in a moment the dark waves uprear their heads and scatter\ntheir sea-wrack in all directions- even thus troubled were the hearts\nof the Achaeans. \n\nThe son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a\ncouncil man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made haste\nalso himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their assembly.\nAgamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataract on the\nside of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he spoke\nto the Achaeans. \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes and councillors of\nthe Argives, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel\nJove gave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city of Troy\nbefore returning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me\ngo ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is\nthe will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust as he\nwill yet lay others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore, let\nus all do as I say and sail back to our own country, for we shall\nnot take Troy.\" \n\nThus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat sorrowful\nthere, but they all held their peace, till at last Diomed of the loud\nbattle-cry made answer saying, \"Son of Atreus, I will chide your folly,\nas is my right in council. Be not then aggrieved that I should do\nso. In the first place you attacked me before all the Danaans and\nsaid that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives young and old\nknow that you did so. But the son of scheming Saturn endowed you by\nhalves only. He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, but valour,\nwhich is the highest both right and might he did not give you. Sir,\nthink you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and\ncowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon going home-\ngo- the way is open to you; the many ships that followed you from\nMycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stay here\ntill we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should turn homeward\nwith their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still fight on till we\nreach the goal of Ilius, for for heaven was with us when we came.\"\n\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed,\nand presently Nestor rose to speak. \"Son of Tydeus,\" said he, \"in\nwar your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all\nwho are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light of\nwhat you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end\nof the whole matter. You are still young- you might be the youngest\nof my own children- still you have spoken wisely and have counselled\nthe chief of the Achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless I am\nolder than you and I will tell you every\" thing; therefore let no\nman, not even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments\ncivil discord is a clanless, hearthless outlaw. \n\n\"Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers,\nbut let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that is\nwithout the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men;\nwhen they have been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give your\norders, for you are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast for\nyour councillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so;\nthere is abundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of the Achaeans\nbring from Thrace daily. You have everything at your disposal wherewith\nto entertain guests, and you have many subjects. When many are got\ntogether, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest- and sorely\ndo we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit his watchfires\nhard by our ships. Who can be other than dismayed? This night will\neither be the ruin of our host, or save it.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinels\nwent out in their armour under command of Nestor's son Thrasymedes,\na captain of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus and Ialmenus:\nthere were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the son of Creion,\nnoble Lycomedes. There were seven captains of the sentinels, and with\neach there went a hundred youths armed with long spears: they took\ntheir places midway between the trench and the wall, and when they\nhad done so they lit their fires and got every man his supper.\n\nThe son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to his\nquarters prepared a great feast in their honour. They laid their hands\non the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had\nenough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose counsel was ever truest,\nwas the first to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, with all\nsincerity and goodwill addressed them thus. \n\n\"With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\nwill I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over much\npeople. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and\nto uphold righteousness, that you may take thought for your people\nunder you; therefore it behooves you above all others both to speak\nand to give ear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have\nbeen minded to speak wisely. All turns on you and on your commands,\ntherefore I will say what I think will be best. No man will be of\na truer mind than that which has been mine from the hour when you,\nsir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent against\nmy judgment. I urged you not to do so, but you yielded to your own\npride, and dishonoured a hero whom heaven itself had honoured- for\nyou still hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however,\nlet us think how we may appease him, both with presents and fair speeches\nthat may conciliate him.\" \n\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, you have reproved my folly justly.\nI was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in himself a host,\nand Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroying much people\nof the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded to my worser\nmind; therefore I will make amends, and will give him great gifts\nby way of atonement. I will tell them in the presence of you all.\nI will give him seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire,\nand ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons and\ntwelve strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich,\nindeed, both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as my\nhorses have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians,\nwhom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty.\nI will give him these, and with them her whom I erewhile took from\nhim, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a great oath that I never\nwent up into her couch, nor have been with her after the manner of\nmen and women. \n\n\"All these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter the gods\nvouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when we Achaeans\nare dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and bronze to\nhis liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest\nafter Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest\nof all lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I will show him like honour\nwith my own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance.\nI have three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and lphianassa, let\nhim take the one of his choice, freely and without gifts of wooing,\nto the house of Peleus; I will add such dower to boot as no man ever\nyet gave his daughter, and will give him seven well established cities,\nCardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where there is grass; holy Pherae and\nthe rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of\nPedasus, all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The\nmen that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour\nhim with gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to his comfortable\nordinances. All this will I do if he will now forgo his anger. Let\nhim then yieldit is only Hades who is utterly ruthless and unyielding-\nand hence he is of all gods the one most hateful to mankind. Moreover\nI am older and more royal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey\nme.\" \n\nThen Nestor answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon.\nThe gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then send chosen messengers,\nwho may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleus without delay. Let\nthose go whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear to Jove, lead the way;\nlet Ajax and Ulysses follow, and let the heralds Odius and Eurybates\ngo with them. Now bring water for our hands, and bid all keep silence\nwhile we pray to Jove the son of Saturn, if so be that he may have\nmercy upon us.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the\nmixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\nevery man his drink-offering; then, when they had made their offerings,\nand had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set out from\nthe tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, looking first to\none and then to another, but most especially at Ulysses, was instant\nwith them that they should prevail with the noble son of Peleus.\n\nThey went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed earnestly\nto earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of the son of Aeacus\nmight incline favourably towards them. When they reached the ships\nand tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on a lyre,\nfair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver. It\nwas part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the city\nof Eetion, and he was now diverting himself with it and singing the\nfeats of heroes. He was alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite to\nhim and said nothing, waiting till he should cease singing. Ulysses\nand Ajax now came in- Ulysses leading the way -and stood before him.\nAchilles sprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and\nPatroclus, when he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greeted\nthem saying, \"All hail and welcome- you must come upon some great\nmatter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of the Achaeans.\"\n\nWith this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered\nwith purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him,\n\"Son of Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water\nwith the wine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear\nfriends, who are now under my roof.\" \n\nPatroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block in\nfront of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the loin\nalso of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held the meat\nwhile Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put them\non spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn high. When\nthe flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on top\nof them, lifting them up and setting them upon the spit-racks; and\nhe sprinkled them with salt. When the meat was roasted, he set it\non platters, and handed bread round the table in fair baskets, while\nAchilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took his seat facing\nUlysses against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus\noffer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire,\nand they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made a sign\nto Phoenix, and when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup with wine\nand pledged Achilles. \n\n\"Hail,\" said he, \"Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer, neither\nin the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been plenty to eat\nand drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter. Sir, we are\nin the face of great disaster, and without your help know not whether\nwe shall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans and their allies have\ncamped hard by our ships and by the wall; they have lit watchfires\nthroughout their host and deem that nothing can now prevent them from\nfalling on our fleet. Jove, moreover, has sent his lightnings on their\nright; Hector, in all his glory, rages like a maniac; confident that\nJove is with him he fears neither god nor man, but is gone raving\nmad, and prays for the approach of day. He vows that he will hew the\nhigh sterns of our ships in pieces, set fire to their hulls, and make\nhavoc of the Achaeans while they are dazed and smothered in smoke;\nI much fear that heaven will make good his boasting, and it will prove\nour lot to perish at Troy far from our home in Argos. Up, then, and\nlate though it be, save the sons of the Achaeans who faint before\nthe fury of the Trojans. You will repent bitterly hereafter if you\ndo not, for when the harm is done there will be no curing it; consider\nere it be too late, and save the Danaans from destruction.\n\n\"My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon,\ndid he not charge you saying, 'Son, Minerva and Juno will make you\nstrong if they choose, but check your high temper, for the better\npart is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and the Achaeans old\nand young will respect you more for doing so.' These were his words,\nbut you have forgotten them. Even now, however, be appeased, and put\naway your anger from you. Agamemnon will make you great amends if\nyou will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you what he has said\nin his tent that he will give you. He will give you seven tripods\nthat have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of gold; twenty\niron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have won races and carried\noff prizes. Rich indeed both in land and gold is he who has as many\nprizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon. Moreover he will give\nyou seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he chose for himself,\nwhen you took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty. He will give you these,\nand with them her whom he erewhile took from you, the daughter of\nBriseus, and he will swear a great oath, he has never gone up into\nher couch nor been with her after the manner of men and women. All\nthese things will he give you now down, and if hereafter the gods\nvouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you can come when we Achaeans\nare dividing the spoil, and load your ship with gold and bronze to\nyour liking. You can take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest after\nHelen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all\nlands, you shall be his son-in-law, and he will show you like honour\nwith his own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance.\nAgamemnon has three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa;\nyou may take the one of your choice, freely and without gifts of wooing,\nto the house of Peleus; he will add such dower to boot as no man ever\nyet gave his daughter, and will give you seven well-established cities,\nCardamyle, Enope, and Hire where there is grass; holy Pheras and the\nrich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus,\nall near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that\ndwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour you with\ngifts as though were a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances.\nAll this will he do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though\nyou hate both him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the\nrest of the Achaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they\nwill honour you as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands.\nYou might even kill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he\nis infatuated, and declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have\nbrought can hold his own against him.\" \n\nAchilles answered, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give you\nformal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be no\nmore of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do\nI hate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hides\nanother in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will be\nappeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the\nDanaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my fighting. He that\nfights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero are\nheld in equal honour, and death deals like measure to him who works\nand him who is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships- with\nmy life ever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes\nit to her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so man a long\nnight have I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by\nday against those who were fighting for their women. With my ships\nI have taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed\nwith my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one of\nthem, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where\nhe was by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept\nmuch himself. \n\n\"Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the chieftains\nand kings, and these have them still; from me alone of the Achaeans\ndid he take the woman in whom I delighted- let him keep her and sleep\nwith her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the Trojans? What\nmade the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them? Was it not\nfor the sake of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the only men in the\nworld who love their wives? Any man of common right feeling will love\nand cherish her who is his own, as I this woman, with my whole heart,\nthough she was but a fruitling of my spear. Agamemnon has taken her\nfrom me; he has played me false; I know him; let him tempt me no further,\nfor he shall not move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses, and to the\nother princes to save his ships from burning. He has done much without\nme already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep and wide\nall round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but even so\nhe stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as I fought the\nAchaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from the city walls;\nhe would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak tree, but no further.\nOnce he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escape my onset: now,\nhowever, since I am in no mood to fight him, I will to-morrow offer\nsacrifice to Jove and to all the gods; I will draw my ships into the\nwater and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning, if you care to\nlook, you will see my ships on the Hellespont, and my men rowing out\nto sea with might and main. If great Neptune vouchsafes me a fair\npassage, in three days I shall be in Phthia. I have much there that\nI left behind me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shall bring\nback still further store of gold, of red copper, of fair women, and\nof iron, my share of the spoils that we have taken; but one prize,\nhe who gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I now bid you,\nand tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him and beware of\nhim should he think that he can yet dupe others for his effrontery\nnever fails him. \n\n\"As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I\nwill take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in common\nwith him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozen\nme further; let him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of his\nreason. I loathe his presents, and for himself care not one straw.\nHe may offer me ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay-\nnot though it be all that he has in the world, both now or ever shall\nhave; he may promise me the wealth of Orchomenus or of Egyptian Thebes,\nwhich is the richest city in the whole world, for it has a hundred\ngates through each of which two hundred men may drive at once with\ntheir chariots and horses; he may offer me gifts as the sands of the\nsea or the dust of the plain in multitude, but even so he shall not\nmove me till I have been revenged in full for the bitter wrong he\nhas done me. I will not marry his daughter; she may be fair as Venus,\nand skilful as Minerva, but I will have none of her: let another take\nher, who may be a good match for her and who rules a larger kingdom.\nIf the gods spare me to return home, Peleus will find me a wife; there\nare Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia, daughters of kings that have\ncities under them; of these I can take whom I will and marry her.\nMany a time was I minded when at home in Phthia to woo and wed a woman\nwho would make me a suitable wife, and to enjoy the riches of my old\nfather Peleus. My life is more to me than all the wealth of Ilius\nwhile it was yet at peace before the Achaeans went there, or than\nall the treasure that lies on the stone floor of Apollo's temple beneath\nthe cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and sheep are to be had for harrying,\nand a man buy both tripods and horses if he wants them, but when his\nlife has once left him it can neither be bought nor harried back again.\n\n\"My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may\nmeet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive but\nmy name will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die,\nbut it will be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of you, then,\nI say, 'Go home, for you will not take Ilius.' Jove has held his hand\nover her to protect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore,\nas in duty bound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans the message\nthat I have sent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving\nof their ships and people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the\none that they have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him\nsleep here that he may sail with me in the morning if he so will.\nBut I will not take him by force.\" \n\nThey all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he\nhad denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his great\nfear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said, \"Noble\nAchilles, if you are now minded to return, and in the fierceness of\nyour anger will do nothing to save the ships from burning, how, my\nson, can I remain here without you? Your father Peleus bade me go\nwith you when he sent you as a mere lad from Phthia to Agamemnon.\nYou knew nothing neither of war nor of the arts whereby men make their\nmark in council, and he sent me with you to train you in all excellence\nof speech and action. Therefore, my son, I will not stay here without\nyou- no, not though heaven itself vouchsafe to strip my years from\noff me, and make me young as I was when I first left Hellas the land\nof fair women. I was then flying the anger of father Amyntor, son\nof Ormenus, who was furious with me in the matter of his concubine,\nof whom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother. My\nmother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the woman\nmyself, that so she hate my father, and in the course of time I yielded.\nBut my father soon came to know, and cursed me bitterly, calling the\ndread Erinyes to witness. He prayed that no son of mine might ever\nsit upon knees- and the gods, Jove of the world below and awful Proserpine,\nfulfilled his curse. I took counsel to kill him, but some god stayed\nmy rashness and bade me think on men's evil tongues and how I should\nbe branded as the murderer of my father: nevertheless I could not\nbear to stay in my father's house with him so bitter a against me.\nMy cousins and clansmen came about me, and pressed me sorely to remain;\nmany a sheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog\ndid they set down to roast before the fire; many a jar, too, did they\nbroach of my father's wine. Nine whole nights did they set a guard\nover me taking it in turns to watch, and they kept a fire always burning,\nboth in the cloister of the outer court and in the inner court at\nthe doors of the room wherein I lay; but when the darkness of the\ntenth night came, I broke through the closed doors of my room, and\nclimbed the wall of the outer court after passing quickly and unperceived\nthrough the men on guard and the women servants. I then fled through\nHellas till I came to fertile Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King\nPeleus, who made me welcome and treated me as a father treats an only\nson who will be heir to all his wealth. He made me rich and set me\nover much people, establishing me on the borders of Phthia where I\nwas chief ruler over the Dolopians. \n\n\"It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with all\nmy heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had gone\nout elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up the\ndainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to your\nlips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness\nover my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heaven\nhad vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and I made a son of you,\nAchilles, that in my hour of need you might protect me. Now, therefore,\nI say battle with your pride and beat it; cherish not your anger for\never; the might and majesty of heaven are more than ours, but even\nheaven may be appeased; and if a man has sinned he prays the gods,\nand reconciles them to himself by his piteous cries and by frankincense,\nwith drink-offerings and the savour of burnt sacrifice. For prayers\nare as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes askance,\nthey follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being fierce and fleet of\nfoot, leaves them far behind him, and ever baneful to mankind outstrips\nthem even to the ends of the world; but nevertheless the prayers come\nhobbling and healing after. If a man has pity upon these daughters\nof Jove when they draw near him, they will bless him and hear him\ntoo when he is praying; but if he deny them and will not listen to\nthem, they go to Jove the son of Saturn and pray that he may presently\nfall into sin- to his ruing bitterly hereafter. Therefore, Achilles,\ngive these daughters of Jove due reverence, and bow before them as\nall good men will bow. Were not the son of Atreus offering you gifts\nand promising others later- if he were still furious and implacable-\nI am not he that would bid you throw off your anger and help the Achaeans,\nno matter how great their need; but he is giving much now, and more\nhereafter; he has sent his captains to urge his suit, and has chosen\nthose who of all the Argives are most acceptable to you; make not\nthen their words and their coming to be of none effect. Your anger\nhas been righteous so far. We have heard in song how heroes of old\ntime quarrelled when they were roused to fury, but still they could\nbe won by gifts, and fair words could soothe them. \n\n\"I have an old story in my mind- a very old one- but you are all friends\nand I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians were fighting and\nkilling one another round Calydon- the Aetolians defending the city\nand the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Diana of the golden throne\nwas angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had not offered her his\nharvest first-fruits. The other gods had all been feasted with hecatombs,\nbut to the daughter of great Jove alone he had made no sacrifice.\nHe had forgotten her, or somehow or other it had escaped him, and\nthis was a grievous sin. Thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure\nsent a prodigious creature against him- a savage wild boar with great\nwhite tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands, uprooting apple-trees\nin full bloom and throwing them to the ground. But Meleager son of\nOeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities and killed it- for\nit was so monstrous that not a few were needed, and many a man did\nit stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this the goddess set the Curetes\nand the Aetolians fighting furiously about the head and skin of the\nboar. \n\n\"So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the Curetes,\nand for all their numbers they could not hold their ground under the\ncity walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angered as even\na wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed with his mother Althaea,\nand therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fair Cleopatra,\nwho was daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and of Ides the man\nthen living. He it was who took his bow and faced King Apollo himself\nfor fair Marpessa's sake; her father and mother then named her Alcyone,\nbecause her mother had mourned with the plaintive strains of the halcyon-bird\nwhen Phoebus Apollo had carried her off. Meleager, then, stayed at\nhome with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt by reason of\nhis mother's curses. His mother, grieving for the death of her brother,\nprayed the gods, and beat the earth with her hands, calling upon Hades\nand on awful Proserpine; she went down upon her knees and her bosom\nwas wet with tears as she prayed that they would kill her son- and\nErinys that walks in darkness and knows no ruth heard her from Erebus.\n\n\"Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and\nthe dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon the elders\nof the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest of their\npriests, and begged him to come out and help them, promising him a\ngreat reward. They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the most fertile\nin the plain of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the other open\nplough-land. The old warrior Oeneus implored him, standing at the\nthreshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. His sisters\nand his mother herself besought him sore, but he the more refused\nthem; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to him also\nprayed him, but they could not move him till the foe was battering\nat the very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaled the walls\nand were setting fire to the city. Then at last his sorrowing wife\ndetailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken; she reminded\nhim how the men are slain, and the city is given over to the flames,\nwhile the women and children are carried into captivity; when he heard\nall this, his heart was touched, and he donned his armour to go forth.\nThus of his own inward motion he saved the city of the Aetolians;\nbut they now gave him nothing of those rich rewards that they had\noffered earlier, and though he saved the city he took nothing by it.\nBe not then, my son, thus minded; let not heaven lure you into any\nsuch course. When the ships are burning it will be a harder matter\nto save them. Take the gifts, and go, for the Achaeans will then honour\nyou as a god; whereas if you fight without taking them, you may beat\nthe battle back, but you will not be held in like honour.\"\n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no\nneed of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will abide\nwith me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs are\nstrong. I say further- and lay my saying to your heart- vex me no\nmore with this weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son\nof Atreus. Love him so well, and you may lose the love I bear you.\nYou ought to help me rather in troubling those that trouble me; be\nking as much as I am, and share like honour with myself; the others\nshall take my answer; stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in\nyour bed; at daybreak we will consider whether to remain or go.\"\n\nOn this she nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to prepare\na bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take their leave. Ajax\nson of Telamon then said, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, let us be\ngone, for I see that our journey is vain. We must now take our answer,\nunwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who are waiting to receive\nit. Achilles is savage and remorseless; he is cruel, and cares nothing\nfor the love his comrades lavished upon him more than on all the others.\nHe is implacable- and yet if a man's brother or son has been slain\nhe will accept a fine by way of amends from him that killed him, and\nthe wrong-doer having paid in full remains in peace among his own\npeople; but as for you, Achilles, the gods have put a wicked unforgiving\nspirit in your heart, and this, all about one single girl, whereas\nwe now offer you the seven best we have, and much else into the bargain.\nBe then of a more gracious mind, respect the hospitality of your own\nroof. We are with you as messengers from the host of the Danaans,\nand would fain he held nearest and dearest to yourself of all the\nAchaeans.\" \n\n\"Ajax,\" replied Achilles, \"noble son of Telamon, you have spoken much\nto my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, and remember\nhow the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though I were some\nvile tramp, and that too in the presence of the Argives. Go, then,\nand deliver your message; say that I will have no concern with fighting\ntill Hector, son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of the Myrmidons\nin his murderous course, and flings fire upon their ships. For all\nhis lust of battle, I take it he will be held in check when he is\nat my own tent and ship.\" \n\nOn this they took every man his double cup, made their drink-offerings,\nand went back to the ships, Ulysses leading the way. But Patroclus\ntold his men and the maid-servants to make ready a comfortable bed\nfor Phoenix; they therefore did so with sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet\nof fine linen. The old man then laid himself down and waited till\nmorning came. But Achilles slept in an inner room, and beside him\nthe daughter of Phorbas lovely Diomede, whom he had carried off from\nLesbos. Patroclus lay on the other side of the room, and with him\nfair Iphis whom Achilles had given him when he took Scyros the city\nof Enyeus. \n\nWhen the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeans\nrose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. King\nAgamemnon was the first to do so. Tell me, Ulysses,\" said he, \"will\nhe save the ships from burning, or did be refuse, and is he still\nfurious?\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\nAchilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever,\nand spurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with\nthe Achaeans to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself,\nhe said that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water.\nHe said further that he should advise every one to sail home likewise,\nfor that you will not reach the goal of Ilius. 'Jove,' he said, 'has\nlaid his hand over the city to protect it, and the people have taken\nheart.' This is what he said, and the others who were with me can\ntell you the same story- Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them,\nwho may be trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep,\nfor so Achilles would have it, that he might go home with him in the\nmorning if he so would; but he will not take him by force.\"\n\nThey all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and dejected,\nby reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refused them, till\npresently Diomed said, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\nyou ought not to have sued the son of Peleus nor offered him gifts.\nHe is proud enough as it is, and you have encouraged him in his pride\nam further. Let him stay or go as he will. He will fight later when\nhe is in the humour, and heaven puts it in his mind to do so. Now,\ntherefore, let us all do as I say; we have eaten and drunk our fill,\nlet us then take our rest, for in rest there is both strength and\nstay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears, forthwith bring out\nyour host and your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them on,\nand yourself fighting among the foremost.\" \n\nThus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They then\nmade their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent, where\nthey laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK X\n\nNow the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night\nthrough, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he could\nget no rest. As when fair Juno's lord flashes his lightning in token\nof great rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground,\nor again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war,\neven so did Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled\nwithin him. When he looked upon the plain of Troy he marvelled at\nthe many watchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at the sound of\npipes and flutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned\ntowards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls\nbefore Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness of\nhis soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at once to Nestor son\nof Neleus, and see if between them they could find any way of the\nAchaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt, bound\nhis sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny\nlion over his shoulders- a skin that reached his feet- and took his\nspear in his hand. \n\nNeither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives\nwho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the Trojans.\nHe covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther, put\na casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny\nhand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most powerful\nof the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though he were\na god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting his goodly\narray about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his brother\nhad come. \n\nMenelaus spoke first. \"Why,\" said he, \"my dear brother, are you thus\narming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the Trojans?\nI greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and spy upon\nthe enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of great daring.\"\n\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd\ncounsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his\nmind, and inclines towards Hector's sacrifices rather than ours. I\nnever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in\none day as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans-\nand that too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god\nnor goddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore,\nwith all speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.\nMeanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among\nthe companies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they\nwill listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and Meriones\nbrother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. It was to them\nmore particularly that we gave this charge.\" \n\nMenelaus replied, \"How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with them\nand wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given\nyour orders?\" \"Wait,\" answered King Agamemnon, \"for there are so many\npaths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man\non your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and\nby his father's name, give each all titular observance, and stand\nnot too much upon your own dignity; we must take our full share of\ntoil, for at our birth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us.\"\n\nWith these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went on\nto Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent\nhard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him- his shield,\nhis two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle\nwith which the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people\ninto battle- for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his\nelbow and looked up at Agamemnon. \"Who is it,\" said he, \"that goes\nthus about the host and the ships alone and in the dead of night,\nwhen men are sleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for\nsome comrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but speak. What\nis your business?\" \n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\nname, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has laid labour\nand sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my limbs carry\nme. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my\nheart is big with war and with the jeopardy of the Achaeans. I am\nin great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without sure counsel;\nmy heart beats as though it would leap out of my body, and my limbs\nfail me. If then you can do anything- for you too cannot sleep- let\nus go the round of the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with\ntoil and sleeping to the neglect of their duty. The enemy is encamped\nhard and we know not but he may attack us by night.\" \n\nNestor replied, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\nJove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he will\nhave troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger.\nI will go with you, and we will rouse others, either the son of Tydeus,\nor Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some one\nhad also better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their ships\nare not near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however refrain\nfrom blaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him- and I will\nsay so plainly, even at the risk of offending you- for sleeping and\nleaving all this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about imploring\naid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme danger.\"\n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly,\nfor he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself- not indeed\nfrom sloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects\nme to take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before\nI was, and came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to\ncall the very men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We\nshall find them with the watch outside the gates, for it was there\nI said that we would meet them.\" \n\n\"In that case,\" answered Nestor, \"the Argives will not blame him nor\ndisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them instructions.\"\n\nWith this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his comely\nfeet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large, and\nof a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear,\nand wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First he called\nloudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he was\nsoon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent\nand said, \"Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the\nline of the ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that you\nfind so urgent?\" And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, \"Ulysses, noble\nson of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits.\nCome with me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with\nus whether we shall fight or fly.\" \n\nOn this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about his\nshoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son of\nTydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his\ncomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as\nfor their spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts\nthat were driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed\nafar like the lightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon\nthe skin of an ox, with a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor\nwent up to him and stirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding\nhim and urging him to bestir himself. \"Wake up,\" he exclaimed, \"son\nof Tydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? Can you not see that\nthe Trojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships,\nwith but a little space between us and them?\" \n\nOn these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, \"Old man, your\nheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are there\nno younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the\nprinces? There is no tiring you.\" \n\nAnd Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, \"My son, all that you have\nsaid is true. I have good sons, and also much people who might call\nthe chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and\ndeath are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for\nyou are younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet\nson of Phyleus.\" \n\nDiomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders- a\nskin that reached his feet- and grasped his spear. When he had roused\nthe heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the round\nof those who were on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at\ntheir posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As\nsheep dogs that watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear\na wild beast coming through the mountain forest towards them- forthwith\nthere is a hue and cry of dogs and men, and slumber is broken- even\nso was sleep chased from the eyes of the Achaeans as they kept the\nwatches of the wicked night, for they turned constantly towards the\nplain whenever they heard any stir among the Trojans. The old man\nwas glad bade them be of good cheer. \"Watch on, my children,\" said\nhe, \"and let not sleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph\nover us.\" \n\nWith this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of the\nAchaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the brave\nson of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were\nbeyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held their meeting\non the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses, for it\nwas here that when night fell Hector had turned back from his onslaught\non the Argives. They sat down, therefore, and held debate with one\nanother. \n\nNestor spoke first. \"My friends,\" said he, \"is there any man bold\nenough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or us news\nof what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by the ships\naway from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\nthey will retire within their walls. If he could learn all this and\ncome back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in the mouths\nof all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs from all\nour ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb- which\nis a present of surpassing value- and he would be asked as a guest\nto all feasts and clan-gatherings.\" \n\nThey all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke saying,\n\"Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over against\nus, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greater confidence\nand comfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some opportunity\nwhich the other has not caught sight of; if a man is alone he is less\nfull of resource, and his wit is weaker.\" \n\nOn this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes, servants\nof Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did\nMenelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host of\nthe Trojans, for he was ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon\nking of men spoke thus: \"Diomed,\" said he, \"son of Tydeus, man after\nmy own heart, choose your comrade for yourself- take the best man\nof those that have offered, for many would now go with you. Do not\nthrough delicacy reject the better man, and take the worst out of\nrespect for his lineage, because he is of more royal blood.\"\n\nHe said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, \"If\nyou bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I fail\nto think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face\nall kinds of danger- and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were\nto go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is\nquick to see and understand.\" \n\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Ulysses, \"say neither good nor ill about\nme, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, for\nthe night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,\ntwo-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone\nleft us.\" \n\nThey then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son\nof Tydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his\nship) and on his head he set a helmet of bull's hide without either\npeak or crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear.\nMeriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set\na leathern helmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern\nthongs, while on the outside it was thickly studded with boar's teeth,\nwell and skilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner lining\nof felt. This helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out of Eleon when\nhe broke into the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. He gave it to Amphidamas\nof Cythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift\nto Molus, who gave it to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon\nthe head of Ulysses. \n\nWhen the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains\nbehind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon\ntheir right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they\nheard its cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to Minerva:\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who spy\nout all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships; befriend\nme in this mine hour, and grant that we may return to the ships covered\nwith glory after having achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring\nsorrow to the Trojans.\" \n\nThen Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: \"Hear me too,\" said he,\n\"daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with my\nnoble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the Achaeans.\nHe left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus, and went to\nthe city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; on his return\nthence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring, for\nyou were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard me now, and\nin return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a\nyear old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I\nwill gild her horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\"\n\nThus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they\nhad done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their way\nlike two lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained\nbodies of them that had fallen. \n\nNeither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called\nthe princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his counsel\nbefore them. \"Is there one,\" said he, \"who for a great reward will\ndo me the service of which I will tell you? He shall be well paid\nif he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the\nfleetest that can be found at the ships of the Achaeans, if he will\ndare this thing; and he will win infinite honour to boot; he must\ngo to the ships and find out whether they are still guarded as heretofore,\nor whether now that we have beaten them the Achaeans design to fly,\nand through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.\"\n\nThey all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain\nman named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald- a man rich in\ngold and bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an\nonly son among five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans.\n\"I, Hector,\" said he, \"Will to the ships and will exploit them. But\nfirst hold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the chariot,\nbedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry the noble son of\nPeleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail you. I will\ngo through the host from one end to the other till I come to the ship\nof Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are now\nconsulting whether they shall fight or fly.\" \n\nWhen he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore him\nhis oath saying, \"May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear witness\nthat no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that\nyou shall have your will with them for ever.\" \n\nThe oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on going.\nHe hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore the skin\nof a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret skin. Then\nhe took a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships, but he\nwas not to return with any news for Hector. When he had left the horses\nand the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but Ulysses\nperceived his coming and said to Diomed, \"Diomed, here is some one\nfrom the camp; I am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is\nsome thief who would plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a\nlittle past us, we can then spring upon him and take him. If, however,\nhe is too quick for us, go after him with your spear and hem him in\ntowards the ships away from the Trojan camp, to prevent his getting\nback to the town.\" \n\nWith this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses.\nDolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had got\nabout as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds\none that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land\nquicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their footsteps\nhe stood still, for he made sure they were friends from the Trojan\ncamp come by Hector's orders to bid him return; when, however, they\nwere only a spear's cast, or less away form him, he saw that they\nwere enemies as fast as his legs could take him. The others gave chase\nat once, and as a couple of well-trained hounds press forward after\na doe or hare that runs screaming in front of them, even so did the\nson of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cut him off from his own\npeople. But when he had fled so far towards the ships that he would\nsoon have fallen in with the outposts, Minerva infused fresh strength\ninto the son of Tydeus for fear some other of the Achaeans might have\nthe glory of being first to hit him, and he might himself be only\nsecond; he therefore sprang forward with his spear and said, \"Stand,\nor I shall throw my spear, and in that case I shall soon make an end\nof you.\" \n\nHe threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew\nover the man's right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He stood\nstock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered, and\nhe turned pale with fear. The two came breathless up to him and seized\nhis hands, whereon he began to weep and said, \"Take me alive; I will\nransom myself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron,\nand from this my father will satisfy you with a very large ransom,\nshould he hear of my being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\n\n\"Fear not,\" replied Ulysses, \"let no thought of death be in your mind;\nbut tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about alone\nin the dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships, while\nother men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies of the slain,\nor did Hector send you to spy out what was going on at the ships?\nOr did you come here of your own mere notion?\" \n\nDolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: \"Hector, with his\nvain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He said\nhe would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his bronze-bedizened\nchariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the flying night, get\nclose to the enemy, and find out whether the ships are still guarded\nas heretofore, or whether, now that we have beaten them, the Achaeans\ndesign to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep\ntheir watches.\" \n\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \"You had indeed set your heart\nupon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are\nhardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles\nhimself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and tell me true,\nwhere did you leave Hector when you started? Where lies his armour\nand his horses? How, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of the\nTrojans ordered? What are their plans? Will they stay here by the\nships and away from the city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\nwill they retire within their walls?\" \n\nAnd Dolon answered, \"I will tell you truly all. Hector and the other\ncouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of great Ilus,\naway from the general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask\nme, there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host. The Trojans\nhave their watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they, therefore,\nare awake and keep each other to their duty as sentinels; but the\nallies who have come from other places are asleep and leave it to\nthe Trojans to keep guard, for their wives and children are not here.\"\n\nUlysses then said, \"Now tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan\ntroops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may understand it.\"\n\n\"I will tell you truly all,\" replied Dolon. \"To the seaward lie the\nCarians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and the\nnoble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and\nMeonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask\nabout an this? If you want to find your way into the host of the Trojans,\nthere are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lie apart from\nthe others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesus son of\nEioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongest that\nI have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any wind\nthat blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and he has\nbrought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarest workmanship- too\nsplendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet only for the gods.\nNow, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely here, until\nyou come back and have proved my words whether they be false or true.\"\n\nDiomed looked sternly at him and answered, \"Think not, Dolon, for\nall the good information you have given us, that you shall escape\nnow you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you\nwill come some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as\na spy or as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you\nwill give no more trouble.\" \n\nOn this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him further,\nbut Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his sword and\ncut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the dust\nwhile he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his\nhead, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses\nhung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and\nprayed saying, \"Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in\npreference to all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still further\ntowards the horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians.\"\n\nWith these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree,\nand they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs\nof tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through\nthe' flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid the\nfallen armour and the blood, and came presently to the company of\nThracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with their day's toil;\ntheir goodly armour was lying on the ground beside them all orderly\nin three rows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus\nwas sleeping in the middle, and hard by him his horses were made fast\nto the topmost rim of his chariot. Ulysses from some way off saw him\nand said, \"This, Diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about\nwhich Dolon whom we killed told us. Do your very utmost; dally not\nabout your armour, but loose the horses at once- or else kill the\nmen yourself, while I see to the horses.\" \n\nThereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote\nthem right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being\nhacked about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion springs\nfuriously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds without their\nshepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian soldiers\ntill he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and drew\nthem aside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go forward\nfreely without being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies,\nfor they were not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to\nthe king, he killed him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing\nhard, for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the seed of Oeneus,\nhovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses untied the horses,\nmade them fast one to another and drove them off, striking them with\nhis bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then\nhe whistled as a sign to Diomed. \n\nBut Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he\nmight accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which\nthe king's armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift\nthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill\nsome more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up\nto him and said, \"Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be driven\nthither, should some other god rouse the Trojans.\" \n\nDiomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the horses.\nUlysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the ships of\nthe Achaeans. \n\nBut Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the son\nof Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the Trojans\nhe roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman\nof Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses\nwere no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping in their\ndeath-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend\nby name. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people\nkept hurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes\nwho had now got away towards the ships. \n\nWhen they reached the place where they had killed Hector's scout,\nUlysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the ground,\nplaced the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and remounted:\nthen he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward nothing loth\ntowards the ships as though of their own free will. Nestor was first\nto hear the tramp of their feet. \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes and\ncounsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right or wrong?- but I must\nsay what I think: there is a sound in my ears as of the tramp of horses.\nI hope it may Diomed and Ulysses driving in horses from the Trojans,\nbut I much fear that the bravest of the Argives may have come to some\nharm at their hands.\" \n\nHe had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,\nwhereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and congratulated\nthem. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question them. \"Tell me,\"\nsaid he, \"renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by these horses?\nDid you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you\nand give them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant\nwith the Trojans, for old warrior though I am I never hold back by\nthe ships, but I never yet saw or heard of such horses as these are.\nSurely some god must have met you and given them to you, for you are\nboth of dear to Jove, and to Jove's daughter Minerva.\" \n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\nname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than these,\nfor the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses, however,\nabout which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomed killed\ntheir king with the twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the\nships we took a thirteenth man- a scout whom Hector and the other\nTrojans had sent as a spy upon our ships.\" \n\nHe laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while\nthe other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly\nbuilt quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs\nof leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood eating\ntheir sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils of Dolon\nat the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering\nto Minerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea and washed the\nsweat from their bodies, and from their necks and thighs. When the\nsea-water had taken all the sweat from off them, and had refreshed\nthem, they went into the baths and washed themselves. After they had\nso done and had anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table,\nand drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of wine\nto Minerva. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XI\n\nAnd now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of\nlight alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord with\nthe ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. She took\nher stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses' ship which was middlemost\nof all, so that her voice might carry farthest on either side, on\nthe one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the\nother towards those of Achilles- for these two heroes, well-assured\nof their own strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the\ntwo ends of the line. There she took her stand, and raised a cry both\nloud and shrill that filled the Achaeans with courage, giving them\nheart to fight resolutely and with all their might, so that they had\nrather stay there and do battle than go home in their ships.\n\nThe son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves\nfor battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodly\ngreaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle clasps of silver;\nand about his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras had once\ngiven him as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far as Cyprus\nthat the Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore he gave\nit to the king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of gold,\nand ten of tin. There were serpents of cyanus that reared themselves\nup towards the neck, three upon either side, like the rainbows which\nthe son of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal men. About\nhis shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and\nthe scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang\nit. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered his body\nwhen he was in battle- fair to see, with ten circles of bronze running\nall round see, wit it. On the body of the shield there were twenty\nbosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the middle: this\nlast was made to show a Gorgon's head, fierce and grim, with Rout\nand Panic on either side. The band for the arm to go through was of\nsilver, on which there was a writhing snake of cyanus with three heads\nthat sprang from a single neck, and went in and out among one another.\nOn his head Agamemnon set a helmet, with a peak before and behind,\nand four plumes of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; then\nhe grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his\narmour shot from him as a flame into the firmament, while Juno and\nMinerva thundered in honour of the king of rich Mycene. \n\nEvery man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold\nthem in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on foot\nclad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the dawning.\nThe chiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got there,\nbut these came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portent of evil\nsound about their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for he was\nabout to send many a brave man hurrying down to Hades. \n\nThe Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain,\nwere gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who was\nhonoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of Antenor,\nPolybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god. Hector's round\nshield showed in the front rank, and as some baneful star that shines\nfor a moment through a rent in the clouds and is again hidden beneath\nthem; even so was Hector now seen in the front ranks and now again\nin the hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamed like the lightning\nof aegis-bearing Jove. \n\nAnd now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a\nrich man's land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so did\nthe Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood\nfor yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the better\nof the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the\nonly god that went among them; the others were not there, but stayed\nquietly each in his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus.\nAll of them blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to Live victory to\nthe Trojans, but father Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all,\nand sat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city\nof the Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and\nalike upon the slayers and on the slain. \n\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their darts\nrained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hour\ndrew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get\nhis midday meal- for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is\ntired out, and must now have food- then the Danaans with a cry that\nrang through all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon\nled them on, and slew first Bienor, a leader of his people, and afterwards\nhis comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprang from his chariot and\nwas coming full towards him; but Agamemnon struck him on the forehead\nwith his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail against the weapon,\nwhich pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were battered\nin and he was killed in full fight. \n\nAgamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with their\nbreasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went on to\nkill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the other\nborn in wedlock; they were in the same chariot- the bastard driving,\nwhile noble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had once taken both\nof them prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them with fresh\nwithes as they were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them;\nnow, however, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in the chest above\nthe nipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphus hard by the ear\nand threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he stripped their goodly\narmour from off them and recognized them, for he had already seen\nthem at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida. As a lion fastens\non the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great jaws, robbing\nthem of their tender life while he on his way back to his lair- the\nhind can do nothing for them even though she be close by, for she\nis in an agony of fear, and flies through the thick forest, sweating,\nand at her utmost speed before the mighty monster- so, no man of the\nTrojans could help Isus and Antiphus, for they were themselves flying\npanic before the Argives. \n\nThen King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and\nbrave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in preventing\nHelen's being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely bribed by Alexandrus;\nand now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the same chariot, trying\nto bring their horses to a stand- for they had lost hold of the reins\nand the horses were mad with fear. The son of Atreus sprang upon them\nlike a lion, and the pair besought him from their chariot. \"Take us\nalive,\" they cried, \"son of Atreus, and you shall receive a great\nransom for us. Our father Antimachus has great store of gold, bronze,\nand wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy you with a very large\nransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\n\nWith such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but they\nheard no pitiful answer in return. \"If,\" said Agamemnon, \"you are\nsons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed that\nMenelaus and Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be killed\nand not suffered to return, you shall now pay for the foul iniquity\nof your father.\" \n\nAs he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth, smiting\nhim on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost upon\nthe ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he\ncut off his hands and his head- which he sent rolling in among the\ncrowd as though it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and wherever\nthe ranks were thickest thither he flew, while the other Achaeans\nfollowed. Foot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in rout\nbefore them, and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen, and\nthe thundering tramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust frim off\nthe plain. King Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and cheering\non the Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze- the eddying\ngusts whirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and are\nconsumed before the blast of the flame- even so fell the heads of\nthe flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and many a noble\npair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways of war, for\nlack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful now to vultures\nthan to their wives. \n\nJove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage and\ndin of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling out lustily\nto the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son of Dardanus,\nin the middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild fig-tree\nmaking always for the city- the son of Atreus still shouting, and\nwith hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the Scaean\ngates and the oak tree, there they halted and waited for the others\nto come up. Meanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over the middle of\nthe plain like a herd cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked\nthem in the dead of night- he springs on one of them, seizes her neck\nin the grip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges\nhimself upon her entrails- even so did King Agamemnon son of Atreus\npursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they fled pell-mell\nbefore him. Many a man was flung headlong from his chariot by the\nhand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded his spear with fury.\n\nBut when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city, the\nfather of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat, thunderbolt\nin hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He then told Iris\nof the golden wings to carry a message for him. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet\nIris, and speak thus to Hector- say that so long as he sees Agamemnon\nheading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, he is to keep\naloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon\nis wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then\nwill I vouchsafe him strength to slay till he reach the ships and\nnight falls at the going down of the sun.\" \n\nIris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the\ncrests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariot\nand horses. Then she said, \"Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in counsel,\nfather Jove has sent me to bear you this message- so long as you see\nAgamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, you\nare to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,\nbut when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes\nto his chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till\nyou reach the ships, and till night falls at the going down of the\nsun.\" \n\nWhen she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armed\nfrom his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went about\neverywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and stirring\nthe dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round, and again\nmet the Achaeans, while the Argives on their part strengthened their\nbattalions. The battle was now in array and they stood face to face\nwith one another, Agamemnon ever pressing forward in his eagerness\nto be ahead of all others. \n\nTell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who, whether\nof the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face Agamemnon? It\nwas Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and of great stature,\nwho was brought up in fertile Thrace the mother of sheep. Cisses,\nhis mother's father, brought him up in his own house when he was a\nchild- Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reached manhood, Cisses\nwould have kept him there, and was for giving him his daughter in\nmarriage, but as soon as he had married he set out to fight the Achaeans\nwith twelve ships that followed him: these he had left at Percote\nand had come on by land to Ilius. He it was that naw met Agamemnon\nson of Atreus. When they were close up with one another, the son of\nAtreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on the girdle below the\ncuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strength\nof arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for the\npoint of the spear struck against the silver and was turned aside\nas though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from his hand,\nand drew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he then drew his\nsword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the neck. So there\nthe poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed\nin the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from his wedded wife, of\nwhom he had had no joy though he had given much for her: he had given\na hundred-head of cattle down, and had promised later on to give a\nthousand sheep and goats mixed, from the countless flocks of which\nhe was possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreus then despoiled him, and\ncarried off his armour into the host of the Achaeans. \n\nWhen noble Coon, Antenor's eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were\nhis eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon he\ngot beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his\narm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the\narm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for this\ndid he leave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that\nflew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon Coon who was trying to\ndrag off the body of his brother- his father's son- by the foot, and\nwas crying for help to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon\nstruck him with a bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was dragging\nthe dead body through the press of men under cover of his shield:\nhe then cut off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas. Thus\ndid the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son of\nAtreus, and go down into the house of Hades. \n\nAs long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon went\nabout attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and with\ngreat handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and\nthe wound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which\nthe Eilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno and dispensers\nof cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour- even so sharp\nwere the pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot,\nand bade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was in great agony.\nWith a loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, \"My friends, princes\nand counsellors of the Argives, defend the ships yourselves, for Jove\nhas not suffered me to fight the whole day through against the Trojans.\"\n\nWith this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and\nthey flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam\nand their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of\nthe battle. \n\nWhen Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the Trojans\nand Lycians saying, \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors, be\nmen, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their best\nman has left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph; charge\nthe foe with your chariots that. you may win still greater glory.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a huntsman\nhounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did Hector,\npeer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans. Full\nof hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight like\nsome fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes its\ndeep blue waters into fury. \n\nWhat, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed\nin the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus,\nAutonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus;\nAesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains\nof the Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank and\nfile. As when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south\nand beats them down with the fierceness of its fury- the waves of\nthe sea roll high, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the\nwandering wind- even so thick were the heads of them that fell by\nthe hand of Hector. \n\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would\nhave fled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to Diomed,\n\"Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget our prowess?\nCome, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, we shall be shamed\nfor ever if Hector takes the ships.\" \n\nAnd Diomed answered, \"Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shall\nhave scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to the Trojans\nrather than to us.\" \n\nWith these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the ground,\nsmiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysses killed\nMolion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that they had stopped\ntheir fighting; the two heroes then went on playing havoc with the\nfoe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the hounds that\nhunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slay them, and\nthe Achaeans were thankful to have breathing time in their flight\nfrom Hector. \n\nThey then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of Merops\nof Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of divination. He\nhad forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would not obey him,\nfor fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son of Tydeus slew them\nboth and stripped them of their armour, while Ulysses killed Hippodamus\nand Hypeirochus. \n\nAnd now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained that\nneither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing one\nanother. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in the\nhip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to fly\nwith, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of\nit at some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremost\nuntil he lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed and Ulysses\nwere making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed by\nthe Trojan ranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and\nsaid to Ulysses who was beside him, \"Great Hector is bearing down\nupon us and we shall be undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.\"\n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss his\nmark. He had aimed at Hector's head near the top of his helmet, but\nbronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spear\nwas stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal, which\nPhoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a great bound\nunder cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped himself\nwith his brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had fallen\non his eyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among\nthe foremost fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the\nground; meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing back into\nhis chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life.\nBut Diomed made at him with his spear and said, \"Dog, you have again\ngot away though death was close on your heels. Phoebus Apollo, to\nwhom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, has again saved you,\nnevertheless I will meet you and make and end of you hereafter, if\nthere is any god who will stand by me too and be my helper. For the\npresent I must pursue those I can lay hands on.\" \n\nAs he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, but\nAlexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaning\nagainst a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son\nof Dardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass\nfrom off the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the\nshield from off his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly\nan arrow that sped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat\nof Diomed's right foot, going right through it and fixing itself in\nthe ground. Thereon Paris with a hearty laugh sprang forward from\nhis hiding-place, and taunted him saying, \"You are wounded- my arrow\nhas not been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly\nand killed you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a\nlion, would have had a truce from evil.\" \n\nDiomed all undaunted answered, \"Archer, you who without your bow are\nnothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single\ncombat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serve\nyou in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched\nthe sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy\nhad hit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when\nI wound a man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for\nmy weapon will lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief\nand his children will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening\nthe earth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round\nhim.\" \n\nThus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this\ncover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the\npain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot and\nbade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.\n\nUlysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for they\nwere all panic-stricken. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in his dismay,\n\"what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before these\nodds, but it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner,\nfor the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic.\nBut why talk to myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards\nquit the field, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand\nfirm and hold his own.\" \n\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced\nand hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to me it. As hounds\nand lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair whetting\nhis white tusks- they attack him from every side and can hear the\ngnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold their\nground- even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses. First he\nsprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on the shoulder\nwith a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. After these\nhe struck Chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he had just\nsprung down from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutched\nthe earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went on\nto wound Charops son of Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus,\nhero that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he was close\nto Ulysses he said, \"Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil,\nthis day you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of\nHippasus and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before\nmy spear.\" \n\nWith these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went through\nthe shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass, tearing\nthe flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not suffer it to pierce\nthe entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hour was not yet come,\nbut he gave ground and said to Socus, \"Wretch, you shall now surely\ndie. You have stayed me from fighting further with the Trojans, but\nyou shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory to myself, and your\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\" \n\nSocus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him\nin the back midway between the shoulders, and went right through his\nchest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over him\nsaying, \"O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has been\ntoo quick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not even\nin death shall your father and mother close your eyes, but the ravening\nvultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their dark wings\nand devour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans will give\nme my due rites of burial.\" \n\nSo saying he drew Socus's heavy spear out of his flesh and from his\nshield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so\nthat he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses was bleeding\nthey raised a great shout and came on in a body towards him; he therefore\ngave ground, and called his comrades to come and help him. Thrice\ndid he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did brave Menelaus\nhear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close beside him and\nsaid, \"Ajax, noble son of Telamon, captain of your people, the cry\nof Ulysses rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off\nand were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let us make our way\nthrough the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I fear he\nmay come to harm for all his valour if he be left without support,\nand the Danaans would miss him sorely.\" \n\nHe led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had gathered\nround Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the carcase of\nsome homed stag that has been hit with an arrow- the stag has fled\nat full speed so long as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted,\nbut when the arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals devour him\nin the shady glades of the forest. Then heaven sends a fierce lion\nthither, whereon the jackals fly in terror and the lion robs them\nof their prey- even so did Trojans many and brave gather round crafty\nUlysses, but the hero stood at bay and kept them off with his spear.\nAjax then came up with his shield before him like a wall, and stood\nhard by, whereon the Trojans fled in all directions. Menelaus took\nUlysses by the hand, and led him out of the press while his squire\nbrought up his chariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans and\nkilled Doryclus, a bastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandocus,\nLysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes rushing\nin full flood from the mountains on to the plain, big with the rain\nof heaven- many a dry oak and many a pine does it engulf, and much\nmud does it bring down and cast into the sea- even so did brave Ajax\nchase the foe furiously over the plain, slaying both men and horses.\n\nHector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting on\nthe extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander,\nwhere the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestor\nand brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughter\nwith his spear and furious driving, and was destroying the ranks that\nwere opposed to him; still the Achaeans would have given no ground,\nhad not Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen stayed the prowess of Machaon\nshepherd of his people, by wounding him in the right shoulder with\na triple-barbed arrow. The Achaeans were in great fear that as the\nfight had turned against them the Trojans might take him prisoner,\nand Idomeneus said to Nestor, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the\nAchaean name, mount your chariot at once; take Machaon with you and\ndrive your horses to the ships as fast as you can. A physician is\nworth more than several other men put together, for he can cut out\narrows and spread healing herbs.\" \n\nNestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at once\nmounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician Aesculapius\nwent with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward nothing loth\ntowards the ships, as though of their own free will. \n\nThen Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from\nhis place beside him, \"Hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme\nwing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout,\nthey and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before\nhim; I know him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot\nand horses thither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately,\nand where the cry of battle is loudest.\" \n\nWith this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip\nthey drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans, over\nthe bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was bespattered\nwith blood, and the rail round the car was covered with splashes both\nfrom the horses' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels. Hector tore\nhis way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and\nhis presence threw the Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not\nlong idle; nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword\nand spear, and throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax son of Telamon,\nfor Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought a better\nman than himself. \n\nThen father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart of\nAjax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind him-\nlooking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some\nwild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowly backwards.\nAs peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their stockyard, and\nwatch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick of their herd-\nhe makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for the darts from many a\nstrong hand fall thick around him, with burning brands that scare\nhim for all his fury, and when morning comes he slinks foiled and\nangry away- even so did Ajax, sorely against his will, retreat angrily\nbefore the Trojans, fearing for the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some\nlazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken about his back, when he\ninto a field begins eating the corn- boys beat him but he is too many\nfor them, and though they lay about with their sticks they cannot\nhurt him; still when he has had his fill they at last drive him from\nthe field- even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue great Ajax,\never smiting the middle of his shield with their darts. Now and again\nhe would turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions of the Trojans,\nand then he would again retreat; but he prevented any of them from\nmaking his way to the ships. Single-handed he stood midway between\nthe Trojans and Achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck\nsome of them in his mighty shield, while many, though thirsting for\nhis blood, fell to the ground ere they could reach him to the wounding\nof his fair flesh. \n\nNow when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was being\noverpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and hurled his\nspear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver below the midriff,\nand laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped the armour\nfrom his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimed an arrow\nat him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow broke, but the\npoint that was left in the wound dragged on the thigh; he drew back,\ntherefore, under cover of his comrades to save his life, shouting\nas he did so to the Danaans, \"My friends, princes and counsellors\nof the Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who is being overpowered,\nand I doubt whether he will come out of the fight alive. Hither, then,\nto the rescue of great Ajax son of Telamon.\" \n\nEven so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came near,\nand gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from their shoulders\nso as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, and turned round\nto stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men. \n\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the\nmares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor out\nof the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles\nsaw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship watching\nthe hard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from the ship\nto his comrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came out looking\nlike Mars himself- here indeed was the beginning of the ill that presently\nbefell him. \"Why,\" said he, \"Achilles do you call me? what do you\nwhat do you want with me?\" And Achilles answered, \"Noble son of Menoetius,\nman after my own heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans\npraying at my knees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroclus,\nand ask Nestor who is that he is bearing away wounded from the field;\nfrom his back I should say it was Machaon son of Aesculapius, but\nI could not see his face for the horses went by me at full speed.\"\n\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off running\nby the ships and tents of the Achaeans. \n\nWhen Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of Neleus,\nthey dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horses from the\nchariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside to dry the\nsweat from their shirts, and when they had so done they came inside\nand took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had had awarded to\nhim from Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them a mess; she was\ndaughter of wise Arsinous, and the Achaeans had given her to Nestor\nbecause he excelled all of them in counsel. First she set for them\na fair and well-made table that had feet of cyanus; on it there was\na vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, with\nhoney and cakes of barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship\nwhich the old man had brought with him from home, studded with bosses\nof gold; it had four handles, on each of which there were two golden\ndoves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. Any one else would\nhardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was full,\nbut Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the woman, as fair as\na goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat's\nmilk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in a handful of white\nbarley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess she bade them drink\nit. When they had done so and had thus quenched their thirst, they\nfell talking with one another, and at this moment Patroclus appeared\nat the door. \n\nWhen the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand,\nled him into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; but\nPatroclus stood where he was and said, \"Noble sir, I may not stay,\nyou cannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be\ntrifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you\nwere bearing away from the field. I can now see for myself that he\nis Machaon shepherd of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles.\nYou, sir, know what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even\nwhere no blame should lie.\" \n\nAnd Nestor answered, \"Why should Achilles care to know how many of\nthe Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns\nin our host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed\nson of Tydeus is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus\nhas been hit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing\nthis man from the field- he too wounded- with an arrow; nevertheless\nAchilles, so valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Will\nhe wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we perish\none upon the other? As for me, I have no strength nor stay in me any\nlonger; would that I Were still young and strong as in the days when\nthere was a fight between us and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding.\nI then killed Itymoneus the valiant son of Hypeirochus a dweller in\nElis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown my\nhand while fighting in the front rank in defence of his cows, so he\nfell and the country people around him were in great fear. We drove\noff a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of cattle\nand as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and as many\nwide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses moreover we seized a hundred\nand fifty, all of them mares, and many had foals running with them.\nAll these did we drive by night to Pylus the city of Neleus, taking\nthem within the city; and the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had\ntaken so much, though it was the first time I had ever been in the\nfield. At daybreak the heralds went round crying that all in Elis\nto whom there was a debt owing should come; and the leading Pylians\nassembled to divide the spoils. There were many to whom the Epeans\nowed chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and had been oppressed\nwith wrong; in former years Hercules had come, and had laid his hand\nheavy upon us, so that all our best men had perished. Neleus had had\ntwelve sons, but I alone was left; the others had all been killed.\nThe Epeans presuming upon all this had looked down upon us and had\ndone us much evil. My father chose a herd of cattle and a great flock\nof sheep- three hundred in all- and he took their shepherds with him,\nfor there was a great debt due to him in Elis, to wit four horses,\nwinners of prizes. They and their chariots with them had gone to the\ngames and were to run for a tripod, but King Augeas took them, and\nsent back their driver grieving for the loss of his horses. Neleus\nwas angered by what he had both said and done, and took great value\nin return, but he divided the rest, that no man might have less than\nhis full share. \n\n\"Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods throughout\nthe city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in a body, many\nin number, they and their chariots, in full array, and with them the\ntwo Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads and unused\nto fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perched upon\na rock on the river Alpheus, the border city Pylus; this they would\ndestroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they had crossed\ntheir whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympus and bade\nus set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiers in Pylos,\nfor the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, and hid my\nhorses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war; nevertheless\nMinerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I was, I fought\namong our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them. There\nis a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene, and there\nthey that were mounted (and I with them) waited till morning, when\nthe companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force. Thence in\nfull panoply and equipment we came towards noon to the sacred waters\nof the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty Jove, with\na bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer to Minerva.\nAfter this we took supper in our companies, and laid us down to rest\neach in his armour by the river. \n\n\"The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take\nit, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store for\nthem. When the sun's rays began to fall upon the earth we joined battle,\npraying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight had begun, I was\nthe first to kill my man and take his horses- to wit the warrior Mulius.\nHe was son-in-law to Augeas, having married his eldest daughter, golden-haired\nAgamede, who knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the face\nof the earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me, and when\nhe fell headlong in the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and took my\nplace in the front ranks. The Epeans fled in all directions when they\nsaw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had) laid low,\nand I swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fifty chariots-\nand in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my spear. I should\nhave even killed the two Moliones sons of Actor, unless their real\nfather, Neptune lord of the earthquake, had hidden them in a thick\nmist and borne them out of the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the\nPylians a great victory, for we chased them far over the plain, killing\nthe men and bringing in their armour, till we had brought our horses\nto Buprasium rich in wheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill\nthat is called Alision, at which point Minerva turned the people back.\nThere I slew the last man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their\nhorses back from Buprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among\nthe gods, and among mortal men to Nestor. \n\n\"Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles is\nfor keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue it hereafter\nwhen the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did not Menoetius\ncharge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon?\nUlysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard all that he said\nto you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits\nthroughout all Achaea, and when we got there we found Menoetius and\nyourself, and Achilles with you. The old knight Peleus was in the\nouter court, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Jove the\nlord of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which\nhe poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. You\ntwo were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood at\nthe gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the hand\ninto the house, placed us at table, and set before us such hospitable\nentertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfied ourselves with\nmeat and drink, I said my say and urged both of you to join us. You\nwere ready enough to do so, and the two old men charged you much and\nstraitly. Old Peleus bade his son Achilles fight ever among the foremost\nand outvie his peers, while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus\nto you: 'My son,' said he, 'Achilles is of nobler birth than you are,\nbut you are older than he, though he is far the better man of the\ntwo. Counsel him wisely, guide him in the right way, and he will follow\nyou to his own profit.' Thus did your father charge you, but you have\nforgotten; nevertheless, even now, say all this to Achilles if he\nwill listen to you. Who knows but with heaven's help you may talk\nhim over, for it is good to take a friend's advice. If, however, he\nis fearful about some oracle, or if his mother has told him something\nfrom Jove, then let him send you, and let the rest of the Myrmidons\nfollow with you, if perchance you may bring light and saving to the\nDanaans. And let him send you into battle clad in his own armour,\nthat the Trojans may mistake you for him and leave off fighting; the\nsons of the Achaeans may thus have time to get their breath, for they\nare hard pressed and there is little breathing time in battle. You,\nwho are fresh, might easily drive a tired enemy back to his walls\nand away from the tents and ships.\" \n\nWith these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off running\nby the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus. When he\nhad got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was their place of assembly\nand court of justice, with their altars dedicated to the gods, Eurypylus\nson of Euaemon met him, wounded in the thigh with an arrow, and limping\nout of the fight. Sweat rained from his head and shoulders, and black\nblood welled from his cruel wound, but his mind did not wander. The\nson of Menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon him and spoke\npiteously saying, \"O unhappy princes and counsellors of the Danaans,\nare you then doomed to feed the hounds of Troy with your fat, far\nfrom your friends and your native land? say, noble Eurypylus, will\nthe Achaeans be able to hold great Hector in check, or will they fall\nnow before his spear?\" \n\nWounded Eurypylus made answer, \"Noble Patroclus, there is no hope\nleft for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All they\nthat were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the\nhands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But save\nme and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash\nthe black blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it those\ngracious herbs which, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles,\nwho was himself shown them by Chiron, most righteous of all the centaurs.\nFor of the physicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that the one\nis lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need of healing, while\nthe other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain.\" \n\n\"Hero Eurypylus,\" replied the brave son of Menoetius, \"how may these\nthings be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble\nAchilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even\nso I will not be unmindful your distress.\" \n\nWith this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,\nand a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground\nfor him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp\narrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with\nwarm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his\nhands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which\nkilled all pain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left off\nflowing. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XII\n\nSo the son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus within\nthe tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately, nor\nwere the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans in\ncheck longer. They had built it to protect their ships, and had dug\nthe trench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and\nthe rich spoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs\nto the gods. It had been built without the consent of the immortals,\nand therefore it did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achilles\nnursed his anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken,\nthe great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of\nthe Trojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some\nwere yet left alive when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenth\nyear, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to their own\ncountry- then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall,\nand they turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount\nIda into the sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus,\nAesopus, and goodly Scamander, with Simois, where many a shield and\nhelm had fallen, and many a hero of the race of demigods had bitten\nthe dust. Phoebus Apollo turned the mouths of all these rivers together\nand made them flow for nine days against the wall, while Jove rained\nthe whole time that he might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune\nhimself, trident in hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea\nall the foundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid\nwith so much toil; he made all level by the mighty stream of the Hellespont,\nand then when he had swept the wall away he spread a great beach of\nsand over the place where it had been. This done he turned the rivers\nback into their old courses. \n\nThis was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but as\nyet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its timbers\nrang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowed by\nthe scourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear of Hector\nthe mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought with the force\nand fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turns fiercely on\nthe dogs and men that attack him, while these form solid wall and\nshower their javelins as they face him- his courage is all undaunted,\nbut his high spirit will be the death of him; many a time does he\ncharge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall back as often\nas he does so- even so did Hector go about among the host exhorting\nhis men, and cheering them on to cross the trench. \n\nBut the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink,\nfor the width frightened them. They could neither jump it nor cross\nit, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above\nwhich there were the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans had\nplanted so close and strong as a defence against all who would assail\nit; a horse, therefore, could not get into it and draw his chariot\nafter him, but those who were on foot kept trying their very utmost.\nThen Polydamas went up to Hector and said, \"Hector, and you other\ncaptains of the Trojans and allies, it is madness for us to try and\ndrive our horses across the trench; it will be very hard to cross,\nfor it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall.\nOur horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no use\nif they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to harm.\nIf, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in his anger\nwill utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly see them\nperish now and here far from Argos; but if they should rally and we\nare driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench there will\nbe not so much as a man get back to the city to tell the tale. Now,\ntherefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires hold our horses\nby the trench, but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, clad in\nfull armour, and if the day of their doom is at hand the Achaeans\nwill not be able to withstand us.\" \n\nThus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang in\nfull armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they saw\nhim do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horses\nover to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at the\ntrench. Then they formed themselves into companies, made themselves\nready, and in five bodies followed their leaders. Those that went\nwith Hector and Polydamas were the bravest and most in number, and\nthe most determined to break through the wall and fight at the ships.\nCebriones was also joined with them as third in command, for Hector\nhad left his chariot in charge of a less valiant soldier. The next\ncompany was led by Paris, Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus\nand Deiphobus, two sons of Priam, and with them was the hero Asius-\nAsius the son of Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breed that\ncomes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas the\nvaliant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sons of Antenor,\nArchelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts of war. Sarpedon\nwas captain over the allies, and took with him Glaucus and Asteropaeus\nwhom he deemed most valiant after himself- for he was far the best\nman of them all. These helped to array one another in their ox-hide\nshields, and then charged straight at the Danaans, for they felt sure\nthat they would not hold out longer and that they should themselves\nnow fall upon the ships. \n\nThe rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel\nof Polydamas but Asius son of Hyrtacus would not leave his horses\nand his esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with\nhim towards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end in consequence.\nNevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exulting in his chariot\nand his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened name had overshadowed\nhim and he had fallen by the spear of Idomeneus the noble son of Deucalion.\nHe had driven towards the left wing of the ships, by which way the\nAchaeans used to return with their chariots and horses from the plain.\nHither he drove and found the gates with their doors opened wide,\nand the great bar down- for the gatemen kept them open so as to let\nthose of their comrades enter who might be flying towards the ships.\nHither of set purpose did he direct his horses, and his men followed\nhim with a loud cry, for they felt sure that the Achaeans would not\nhold out longer, and that they should now fall upon the ships. Little\ndid they know that at the gates they should find two of the bravest\nchieftains, proud sons of the fighting Lapithae- the one, Polypoetes,\nmighty son of Pirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous\nMars. These stood before the gates like two high oak trees upon the\nmountains, that tower from their wide-spreading roots, and year after\nyear battle with wind and rain- even so did these two men await the\nonset of great Asius confidently and without flinching. The Trojans\nled by him and by Iamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius, Thoon\nand Oenomaus, raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the\nwall, holding their shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for\na while the two defenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans\non to stand firm in the defence of their ships; when, however, they\nsaw that the Trojans were attacking the wall, while the Danaans were\ncrying out for help and being routed, they rushed outside and fought\nin front of the gates like two wild boars upon the mountains that\nabide the attack of men and dogs, and charging on either side break\ndown the wood all round them tearing it up by the roots, and one can\nhear the clattering of their tusks, till some one hits them and makes\nan end of them- even so did the gleaming bronze rattle about their\nbreasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they fought with great\nfury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were on the wall\nabove them. These threw great stones at their assailants in defence\nof themselves their tents and their ships. The stones fell thick as\nthe flakes of snow which some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds\nand showers down in sheets upon the earth- even so fell the weapons\nfrom the hands alike of Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang\nout as the great stones rained upon them, and Asius the son of Hyrtacus\nin his dismay cried aloud and smote his two thighs. \"Father Jove,\"\nhe cried, \"of a truth you too are altogether given to lying. I made\nsure the Argive heroes could not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted\nwasps, or bees that have their nests in the rocks by the wayside-\nthey leave not the holes wherein they have built undefended, but fight\nfor their little ones against all who would take them- even so these\nmen, though they be but two, will not be driven from the gates, but\nstand firm either to slay or be slain.\" \n\nHe spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then was\nto give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans were fighting\nabout the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able to tell about\nall these things, for the battle raged everywhere about the stone\nwall as it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited though they\nwere, were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods who were\ndefending the Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithae kept\non fighting with might and main. \n\nThereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a spear\nupon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him, for\nthe point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so that\nthe brain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. He then\nslew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killed Hippomachus\nthe son of Antimachus by striking him with his spear upon the girdle.\nHe then drew his sword and sprang first upon Antiphates whom he killed\nin combat, and who fell face upwards on the earth. After him he killed\nMenon, Iamenus, and Orestes, and laid them low one after the other.\n\nWhile they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the youths\nwho were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were the greater\npart and the most valiant of those that were trying to break through\nthe wall and fire the ships) were still standing by the trench, uncertain\nwhat they should do; for they had seen a sign from heaven when they\nhad essayed to cross it- a soaring eagle that flew skirting the left\nwing of their host, with a monstrous blood-red snake in its talons\nstill alive and struggling to escape. The snake was still bent on\nrevenge, wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it struck the\nbird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird being\nin pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host, and\nthen flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were struck\nwith terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing Jove,\nwrithing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hector and\nsaid, \"Hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke\nme, even when I speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth,\nthat one of the people should cross your will either in the field\nor at the council board; you would have them support you always: nevertheless\nI will say what I think will be best; let us not now go on to fight\nthe Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen if this soaring\neagle which skirted the left wing of our with a monstrous blood-red\nsnake in its talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent\nas an omen to the Trojans on their essaying to cross the trench. The\neagle let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking it home to her\nlittle ones, and so will it be- with ourselves; even though by a mighty\neffort we break through the gates and wall of the Achaeans, and they\ngive way before us, still we shall not return in good order by the\nway we came, but shall leave many a man behind us whom the Achaeans\nwill do to death in defence of their ships. Thus would any seer who\nwas expert in these matters, and was trusted by the people, read the\nportent.\" \n\nHector looked fiercely at him and said, \"Polydamas, I like not of\nyour reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will.\nIf, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven\nrobbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to the counsels\nof Jove, nor to the promises he made me- and he bowed his head in\nconfirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild-fowl.\nWhat care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark, and whether they\nbe on my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trust rather in\nthe counsel of great Jove, king of mortals and immortals. There is\none omen, and one only- that a man should fight for his country. Why\nare you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at the ships of the\nArgives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for you are not\nsteadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or would talk others\nover from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before my spear.\"\n\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after with\na cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent the blast\nof a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dust down\ntowards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into security, and\ngave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to their\nown might and to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break through\nthe great wall of the Achaeans. They tore down the breastworks from\nthe walls, and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved the buttresses,\nwhich the Achaeans had set in front of the wall in order to support\nit; when they had pulled these down they made sure of breaking through\nthe wall, but the Danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they\nstill fenced the battlements with their shields of ox-hide, and hurled\ntheir missiles down upon the foe as soon as any came below the wall.\n\nThe two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the\nAchaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to any\none whom they saw to be remiss. \"My friends,\" they cried, \"Argives\none and all- good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet,\nin which all were of equal prowess- there is now work enough, as you\nvery well know, for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flight\ntowards the ships, daunted by the shouting of the foe, but press forward\nand keep one another in heart, if it may so be that Olympian Jove\nthe lord of lightning will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive\nthem back towards the city.\" \n\nThus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on. As\nthe flakes that fall thick upon a winter's day, when Jove is minded\nto snow and to display these his arrows to mankind- he lulls the wind\nto rest, and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops of\nthe high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy\nplains, and the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the\nforelands, and havens of the grey sea, but the waves as they come\nrolling in stay it that it can come no further, though all else is\nwrapped as with a mantle so heavy are the heavens with snow- even\nthus thickly did the stones fall on one side and on the other, some\nthrown at the Trojans, and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and\nthe whole wall was in an uproar. \n\nStill the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down\nthe gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedon\nagainst the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle. Before\nhim he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith had beaten\nso fair and round, and had lined with ox hides which he had made fast\nwith rivets of gold all round the shield; this he held in front of\nhim, and brandishing his two spears came on like some lion of the\nwilderness, who has been long famished for want of meat and will dare\nbreak even into a well-fenced homestead to try and get at the sheep.\nHe may find the shepherds keeping watch over their flocks with dogs\nand spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from the fold till he\nhas had a try for it; he will either spring on a sheep and carry it\noff, or be hit by a spear from strong hand- even so was Sarpedon fain\nto attack the wall and break down its battlements. Then he said to\nGlaucus son of Hippolochus, \"Glaucus, why in Lycia do we receive especial\nhonour as regards our place at table? Why are the choicest portions\nserved us and our cups kept brimming, and why do men look up to us\nas though we were gods? Moreover we hold a large estate by the banks\nof the river Xanthus, fair with orchard lawns and wheat-growing land;\nit becomes us, therefore, to take our stand at the head of all the\nLycians and bear the brunt of the fight, that one may say to another,\nOur princes in Lycia eat the fat of the land and drink best of wine,\nbut they are fine fellows; they fight well and are ever at the front\nin battle.' My good friend, if, when we were once out of this fight,\nwe could escape old age and death thenceforward and for ever, I should\nneither press forward myself nor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand\nshapes hangs ever over our heads, and no man can elude him; therefore\nlet us go forward and either win glory for ourselves, or yield it\nto another.\" \n\nGlaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host\nof Lycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them,\nfor it was against his part of the wall that they came- bringing destruction\nwith them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain to support\nhis comrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for the fray,\nand Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them; but\nhe could not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great an\nuproar was there from crashing shields and helmets and the battering\nof gates with a din which reached the skies. For all the gates had\nbeen closed, and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and break\ntheir way through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with a\nmessage to Ajax. \"Run, good Thootes,\" said and call Ajax, or better\nstill bid both come, for it will be all over with us here directly;\nthe leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever fought desperately\nheretofore. But if the have too much on their hands to let them come,\nat any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous\nbowman come with him.\" \n\nThe messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wall\nof the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, \"Sirs,\nprinces of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to him\nfor a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or\nit will be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians\nare upon him, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if\nyou have too much on your hands to let both come, at any rate let\nAjax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with\nhim.\" \n\nGreat Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, and at once spoke\nto the son of Oileus. \"Ajax,\" said he, \"do you two, yourself and brave\nLycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight their\nhardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but\nI will come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help\nthey need.\" \n\nWith this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer his brother by\nthe same father went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer's bow. They\nwent along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where\nMenestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave\ncaptains and leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements\nas it were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising\nthe battle-cry aloud. \n\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of Sarpedon,\nhitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the battlements at the\nvery top of the wall. As men now are, even one who is in the bloom\nof youth could hardly lift it with his two hands, but Ajax raised\nit high aloft and flung it down, smashing Epicles' four-crested helmet\nso that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell\nfrom the high wall as though he were diving, with no more life left\nin him. Then Teucer wounded Glaucus the brave son of Hippolochus as\nhe was coming on to attack the wall. He saw his shoulder bare and\naimed an arrow at it, which made Glaucus leave off fighting. Thereon\nhe sprang covertly down for fear some of the Achaeans might see that\nhe was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was stung with grief when he\nsaw Glaucus leave him, still he did not leave off fighting, but aimed\nhis spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor and hit him. He drew his spear\nback again Alcmaon came down headlong after it with his bronzed armour\nrattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized the battlement in his strong\nhands, and tugged at it till it an gave way together, and a breach\nwas made through which many might pass. \n\nAjax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him with\nan arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body,\nbut Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not fall by\nthe ships' sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced his shield,\nbut the spear did not go clean through, though it hustled him back\nthat he could come on no further. He therefore retired a little space\nfrom the battlement, yet without losing all his ground, for he still\nthought to cover himself with glory. Then he turned round and shouted\nto the brave Lycians saying, \"Lycians, why do you thus fail me? For\nall my prowess I cannot break through the wall and open a way to the\nships single-handed. Come close on behind me, for the more there are\nof us the better.\" \n\nThe Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who was\ntheir counsellor their king. The Argives on their part got their men\nin fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly struggle\nbetween them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and force\ntheir way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians from\nthe wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods\nin hand, quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own in\ncommon, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a mere\nstrip, even so did the battlements now serve as a bone of contention,\nand they beat one another's round shields for their possession. Many\na man's body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round\nand bared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean through\ntheir shields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged with\nthe blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans. But even so the Trojans\ncould not rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as some honest\nhard-working woman weighs wool in her balance and sees that the scales\nbe true, for she would gain some pitiful earnings for her little ones,\neven so was the fight balanced evenly between them till the time came\nwhen Jove gave the greater glory to Hector son of Priam, who was first\nto spring towards the wall of the Achaeans. As he did so, he cried\naloud to the Trojans, \"Up, Trojans, break the wall of the Argives,\nand fling fire upon their ships.\" \n\nThus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at\nthe wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements with sharp\nspears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay just outside\nthe gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other; two of\nthe best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise it from\nthe ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted it quite easily\nby himself, for the son of scheming Saturn made it light for him.\nAs a shepherd picks up a ram's fleece with one hand and finds it no\nburden, so easily did Hector lift the great stone and drive it right\nat the doors that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set. These\ndoors were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars\nto which there was but one key. When he had got close up to them,\nHector strode towards them that his blow might gain in force and struck\nthem in the middle, leaning his whole weight against them. He broke\nboth hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its great weight.\nThe portals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, and\nthe doors flew open, one one way, and the other the other, through\nthe force of the blow. Then brave Hector leaped inside with a face\nas dark as that of flying night. The gleaming bronze flashed fiercely\nabout his body and he had tow spears in his hand. None but a god could\nhave withstood him as he flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes\nglared like fire. Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called\non them to scale the wall, and they did as he bade them- some of them\nat once climbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates.\nThe Danaans then fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all\nwas uproar and confusion. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XIII\n\nNow when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the ships,\nhe left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keen eyes\naway, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace, the\nMysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, who live\non milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind. He no longer turned so\nmuch as a glance towards Troy, for he did not think that any of the\nimmortals would go and help either Trojans or Danaans. \n\nBut King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking admiringly\non the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of wooded Samothrace,\nwhence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and the ships\nof the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and taken his place\nhere, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcome by the Trojans;\nand he was furiously angry with Jove. \n\nPresently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as he\nstrode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath\nthe tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the\nfourth he reached his goal- Aegae, where is his glittering golden\npalace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there,\nhe yoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all\nflying in the wind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped\nhis gold whip, and took his stand upon his chariot. As he went his\nway over the waves the sea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew\ntheir lord, and came gambolling round him from every quarter of the\ndeep, while the sea in her gladness opened a path before his chariot.\nSo lightly did the horses fly that the bronze axle of the car was\nnot even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him to\nthe ships of the Achaeans. \n\nNow there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway\nbetween Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the earthquake\nstayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosial\nforage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold which none could\neither unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place\nuntil their lord should return. This done he went his way to the host\nof the Achaeans. \n\nNow the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like a\nstorm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising\nthe cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of\nthe Achaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there. Meanwhile\nearth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on the Argives,\nfor he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice\nof Calchas. \n\nFirst he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,\nand said, \"Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if you\nwill put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted.\nI am not afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force,\nwill be victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all\nof them in check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here\nwhere furious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself,\nis leading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put\nit into your hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others\nto do the like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even\nthough he be inspired by Jove himself.\" \n\nAs he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck both\nof them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring. He made\ntheir legs light and active, as also their hands and their feet. Then,\nas the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some sheer rock,\nand presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even\nso did Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air\nand leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first\nto know who it was that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax\nson of Telamon, \"Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus,\nwho in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by our\nships. It was not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knew him\nat once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods are\nsoon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn more fiercely\nwithin me, while my hands and my feet under me are more eager for\nthe fray.\" \n\nAnd Ajax son of Telamon answered, \"I too feel my hands grasp my spear\nmore firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble; I long,\nmoreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even in single combat.\"\n\nThus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with which\nthe god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler roused the\nAchaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at once\nby hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans had got over\nthe wall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes as they beheld\nthem, for they made sure that they should not escape destruction;\nbut the lord of the earthquake passed lightly about among them and\nurged their battalions to the front. \n\nFirst he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and Thoas\nand Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors; all\ndid he exhort. \"Shame on you young Argives,\" he cried, \"it was on\nyour prowess I relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not\nwith might and main, this very day will see us overcome by the Trojans.\nOf a truth my eyes behold a great and terrible portent which I had\nnever thought to see- the Trojans at our ships- they, who were heretofore\nlike panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest,\nwith no strength but in flight for they cannot defend themselves.\nHitherto the Trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of the\nAchaeans, but now they have sallied far from their city and are fighting\nat our very ships through the cowardice of our leader and the disaffection\nof the people themselves, who in their discontent care not to fight\nin defence of the ships but are being slaughtered near them. True,\nKing Agamemnon son of Atreus is the cause of our disaster by having\ninsulted the son of Peleus, still this is no reason why we should\nleave off fighting. Let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the\nbrave heal quickly. You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the\nfinest soldiers in our whole army. I blame no man for keeping out\nof battle if he is a weakling, but I am indignant with such men as\nyou are. My good friends, matters will soon become even worse through\nthis slackness; think, each one of you, of his own honour and credit,\nfor the hazard of the fight is extreme. Great Hector is now fighting\nat our ships; he has broken through the gates and the strong bolt\nthat held them.\" \n\nThus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them on.\nThereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men, of\nwhom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could make light\nif they went among them, for they were the picked men of all those\nwho were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans. They made\na living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to buckler,\nhelmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests on their gleaming\nhelmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closely seffied\nwere they; the spears they brandished in their strong hands were interlaced,\nand their hearts were set on battle. \n\nThe Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head pressing\nright on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of some mountain\nfrom whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the foundations\nof the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, and as it\nbounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an uproar;\nit swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches level ground,\nbut then for all its fury it can go no further- even so easily did\nHector for a while seem as though he would career through the tents\nand ships of the Achaeans till he had reached the sea in his murderous\ncourse; but the closely serried battalions stayed him when he reached\nthem, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears\npointed at both ends, and drove him from them so that he staggered\nand gave ground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, \"Trojans, Lycians,\nand Dardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans\nhave set themselves as a wall against me, but they will not check\nme for long; they will give ground before me if the mightiest of the\ngods, the thundering spouse of Juno, has indeed inspired my onset.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus son\nof Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with his\nround shield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly forward.\nMeriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit the\nbroad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the spear\nbroke in two pieces long ere he could do so; moreover Deiphobus had\nseen it coming and had held his shield well away from him. Meriones\ndrew back under cover of his comrades, angry alike at having failed\nto vanquish Deiphobus, and having broken his spear. He turned therefore\ntowards the ships and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind\nin his tent. \n\nThe others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into\nthe heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man,\nto wit, the warrior Imbrius son of Mentor rich in horses. Until the\nAchaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste\na bastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet\nhe had gone back to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans,\ndwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like honour with his own\nsons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spear\nwhich he then drew back again, and Imbrius fell headlong as an ash-tree\nwhen it is felled on the crest of some high mountain beacon, and its\ndelicate green foliage comes toppling down to the ground. Thus did\nhe fall with his bronze-dight armour ringing harshly round him, and\nTeucer sprang forward with intent to strip him of his armour; but\nas he was doing so, Hector took aim at him with a spear. Teucer saw\nthe spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit Amphimachus, son\nof Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he was coming into battle,\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\nHector sprang forward to take Amphimachus's helmet from off his temples,\nand in a moment Ajax threw a spear at him, but did not wound him,\nfor he was encased all over in his terrible armour; nevertheless the\nspear struck the boss of his shield with such force as to drive him\nback from the two corpses, which the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius\nand Menestheus, captains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to\nthe host of the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes\ndid the like by Imbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds\nthat have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high\nabove the ground in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the\nbody of Imbrius, and strip it of its armour. Then the son of Oileus\nsevered the head from the neck in revenge for the death of Amphimachus,\nand sent it whirling over the crowd as though it had been a ball,\ntill fell in the dust at Hector's feet. \n\nNeptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus should\nhave fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of the Achaeans\nto urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for the Trojans.\nIdomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who had just\ncome to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. His fellow-soldiers\nbore him off the field, and Idomeneus having given orders to the physicians\nwent on to his tent, for he was still thirsting for battle. Neptune\nspoke in the likeness and with the voice of Thoas son of Andraemon\nwho ruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron and high Calydon, and was honoured\namong his people as though he were a god. \"Idomeneus,\" said he, \"lawgiver\nto the Cretans, what has now become of the threats with which the\nsons of the Achaeans used to threaten the Trojans?\" \n\nAnd Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, \"Thoas, no one, so\nfar as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held back\nneither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the of almighty\nJove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos:\nyou, Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart\nif you see any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all\nto do their utmost.\" \n\nTo this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, \"Idomeneus, may\nhe never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten upon,\nwho is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour and go,\nwe must make all haste together if we may be of any use, though we\nare only two. Even cowards gain courage from companionship, and we\ntwo can hold our own with the bravest.\" \n\nTherewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and Idomeneus\nwhen he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped his two spears,\nand sallied forth. As the lightning which the son of Saturn brandishes\nfrom bright Olympus when he would show a sign to mortals, and its\ngleam flashes far and wide- even so did his armour gleam about him\nas he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire met him while he was still near\nhis tent (for he was going to fetch his spear) and Idomeneus said\n\n\"Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you left\nthe field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting\nyou? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I had\nfar rather fight than stay in my tent.\" \n\n\"Idomeneus,\" answered Meriones, \"I come for a spear, if I can find\none in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at the\nshield of Deiphobus.\" \n\nAnd Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, \"You will find one\nspear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall\nof my tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for\nI am not one to keep my enemy at arm's length; therefore I have spears,\nbossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets.\" \n\nThen Meriones said, \"I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils taken\nfrom the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at all times\nvalorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my own\namong the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who do not\nknow how I fight, but you know it well enough yourself.\"\n\nIdomeneus answered, \"I know you for a brave man: you need not tell\nme. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush-\nand there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of;\nit comes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change\ncolour at every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keeps shifting\nhis weight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart beats\nfast as he thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of his\nteeth; whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be on finding\nhimself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go into action-\nif the best men were being chosen for such a service, no one could\nmake light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck by\na dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind, in\nyour neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or belly\nas you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks. But let\nus no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill spoken\nof; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once.\" \n\nOn this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself a\nspear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with great\ndeeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and\nhis son Panic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror\neven into the heart of a hero- the pair have gone from Thrace to arm\nthemselves among the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they will\nnot listen to both the contending hosts, and will give victory to\none side or to the other- even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captains\nof men, go out to battle clad in their bronze armour. Meriones was\nfirst to speak. \"Son of Deucalion,\" said he, \"where would you have\nus begin fighting? On the right wing of the host, in the centre, or\non the left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?\"\n\nIdomeneus answered, \"There are others to defend the centre- the two\nAjaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans, and\nis good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector son of\nPriam enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to vanquish\ntheir indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of Saturn\nfling a firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon\nwill yield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats the grain of\nCeres, if bronze and great stones can overthrow him. He would not\nyield even to Achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of\nfoot there is none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards the\nleft wing, that we may know forthwith whether we are to give glory\nto some other, or he to us.\" \n\nMeriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to the\npart of the host which Idomeneus had named. \n\nNow when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire,\nhim and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shouted\nand made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight\nraged under the ships' sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle\nupon a day when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it\ninto a thick cloud- even such was the fury of the combat, and might\nand main did they hack at each other with spear and sword throughout\nthe host. The field bristled with the long and deadly spears which\nthey bore. Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their\nfresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they joined\nbattle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage who could\ntake pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look on it without\nbeing dismayed. \n\nThus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal heroes.\nJove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to Hector, so as\nto do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did not mean to utterly\noverthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, and only wanted to glorify\nThetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the other hand went about among\nthe Argives to incite them, having come up from the grey sea in secret,\nfor he was grieved at seeing them vanquished by the Trojans, and was\nfuriously angry with Jove. Both were of the same race and country,\nbut Jove was elder born and knew more, therefore Neptune feared to\ndefend the Argives openly, but in the likeness of man, he kept on\nencouraging them throughout their host. Thus, then, did these two\ndevise a knot of war and battle, that none could unloose or break,\nand set both sides tugging at it, to the failing of men's knees beneath\nthem. \n\nAnd now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,\ncalled loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as he\nleaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner,\nwho had but lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandra\nthe fairest of Priam's daughters in marriage, but offered no gifts\nof wooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he would drive\nthe sons of the Achaeans willy nilly from Troy; old King Priam had\ngiven his consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on the\nstrength of the promises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed a spear,\nand hit him as he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze did not\nprotect him, and the spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily\nto the ground. Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying, \"Othryoneus,\nthere is no one in the world whom I shall admire more than I do you,\nif you indeed perform what you have promised Priam son of Dardanus\nin return for his daughter. We too will make you an offer; we will\ngive you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus, and will bring\nher from Argos for you to marry, if you will sack the goodly city\nof Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along with me, that we\nmay make a covenant at the ships about the marriage, and we will not\nbe hard upon you about gifts of wooing.\" \n\nWith this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick\nof the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in front\nof his horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he\ncould feel their 'breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike\ndown Idomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with his\nspear in the throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean\nthrough it. He fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrights\nhave felled for ship's timber upon the mountains with whetted axes-\neven thus did he lie full length in front of his chariot and horses,\ngrinding his teeth and clutching at the bloodstained just. His charioteer\nwas struck with panic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape:\nthereupon Antilochus hit him in the middle of his body with a spear;\nhis cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the spear stuck in\nhis belly. He fell gasping from his chariot and Antilochus great Nestor's\nson, drove his horses from the Trojans to the Achaeans. \n\nDeiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and took\naim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided\nit, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore- a shield\nof oxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He crouched\nunder cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the shield rang\nout as the spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in vain from the\nstrong hand of Deiphobus, for it struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus,\nshepherd of his people, in the liver under the midriff, and his limbs\nfailed beneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud\nvoice saying, \"Of a truth Asius has not fallen unavenied; he will\nbe glad even while passing into the house of Hades, strong warden\nof the gate, that I have sent some one to escort him.\" \n\nThus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. Noble\nAntilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him\nforget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and\ncovered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades, Mecisteus\nson of Echius, and Alastor stooped down, and bore him away groaning\nheavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He kept on\nstriving continually either to enshroud some Trojan in the darkness\nof death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil day from the\nAchaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes: he was son-in-law\nto Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia who was\nthe darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her generation\nin beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore the bravest\nman in all Troy had taken her to wife- him did Neptune lay low by\nthe hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding his strong\nlimbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one side,\nbut stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck\nhim with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mail that\nhad hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly as\nthe spear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground, and the\nspear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end\nof the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life. Idomeneus\nvaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, \"Deiphobus, since\nyou are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killed\nthree men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself,\nthat you may learn what manner of Jove-begotten man am I that have\ncome hither. Jove first begot Minos chief ruler in Crete, and Minos\nin his turn begot a son, noble Deucalion; Deucalion begot me to be\na ruler over many men in Crete, and my ships have now brought me hither,\nto be the bane of yourself, your father, and the Trojans.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go back\nand fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the challenge\nsingle-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch Aeneas,\nwhom he found standing in the rear, for he had long been aggrieved\nwith Priam because in spite his brave deeds he did not give him his\ndue share of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said, \"Aeneas, prince\namong the Trojans, if you know any ties of kinship, help me now to\ndefend the body of your sister's husband; come with me to the rescue\nof Alcathous, who being husband to your sister brought you up when\nyou were a child in his house, and now Idomeneus has slain him.\"\n\nWith these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in pursuit\nof Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneus was not\nto be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his ground\nas a wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming of\na great crowd of men in some lonely place- the bristles stand upright\non his back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness\nto defend himself against hounds and men- even so did famed Idomeneus\nhold his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud\nto his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus, Deipyrus, Meriones,\nand Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers- \"Hither my friends,\" he\ncried, \"and leave me not single-handed- I go in great fear by fleet\nAeneas, who is coming against me, and is a redoubtable dispenser of\ndeath battle. Moreover he is in the flower of youth when a man's strength\nis greatest; if I was of the same age as he is and in my present mind,\neither he or I should soon bear away the prize of victory\n\nOn this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on shoulder.\nAeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking towards Deiphobus,\nParis, and Agenor, who were leaders of the Trojans along with himself,\nand the people followed them as sheep follow the ram when they go\ndown to drink after they have been feeding, and the heart of the shepherd\nis glad- even so was the heart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his\npeople follow him. \n\nThen they fought furiously in close combat about the body of Alcathous,\nwielding their long spears; and the bronze armour about their bodies\nrang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the press of the\nfight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers of Mars, outxied\nevery one in their desire to hack at each other with sword and spear.\nAeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was on the lookout and avoided\nthe spear, so that it sped from Aeneas' strong hand in vain, and fell\nquivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oenomaus in the\nmiddle of his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereon his\nbowels came gushing out and he clutched the earth in the palms of\nhis hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus drew his spear\nout of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his armour\nfor the rain of darts that were showered upon him: moreover his strength\nwas now beginning to fail him so that he could no longer charge, and\ncould neither spring forward to recover his own weapon nor swerve\naside to avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore, though he still\ndefended himself in hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear\nhim swiftly out of the battle. Deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he\nwas retreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him\nwas as fierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit Ascalaphus,\nthe son of Mars; the spear went through his shoulder, and he clutched\nthe earth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.\n\nGrim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen,\nfor he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the golden clouds,\nby command of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting, forbidden\nto take part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously about the\nbody. Deiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, but Meriones sprang\nupon him, and struck him on the arm with a spear so that the visored\nhelmet fell from his hand and came ringing down upon the ground. Thereon\nMeriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from his shoulder,\nand fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites, own brother of\nDeiphobus passed his arms around his waist, and bore him away from\nthe battle till he got to his horses that were standing in the rear\nof the fight with the chariot and their driver. These took him towards\nthe city groaning and in great pain, with the blood flowing from his\narm. \n\nThe others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven without\nceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and struck him\nwith a spear in his throat which was turned towards him; his head\nfell on one side, his helmet and shield came down along with him,\nand death, life's foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied his chance,\nflew forward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round.\nHe laid open the vein that runs all the way up the back to the neck;\nhe cut this vein clean away throughout its whole course, and Thoon\nfell in the dust face upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly\ntowards his comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the\narmour from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so.\nThe Trojans came about him on every side and struck his broad and\ngleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptune stood guard\nover the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thickly round him. He\nwas never clear of the foe, but was always in the thick of the fight;\nhis spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it in every direction,\nso eager was he to hit some one from a distance or to fight him hand\nto hand. \n\nAs he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas son of\nAsius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the middle\nof his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, for he grudged\nhim the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of the spear stuck\nfast like a charred stake in Antilochus's shield, while the other\nlay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men,\nbut Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway between\nthe private parts and the navel, where a wound is particualrly painful\nto wretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed\nconvulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen have\nbound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce. Even so did\nhe move convulsively for a while, but not for very long, till Meriones\ncame up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyes were veiled\nin darkness. \n\nHelenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting\nhim on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his\nhead; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were fighting\non the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his feet, but\nthe eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.\n\nOn this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,\nbrandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the two attacked\none another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and\nthe other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit the breastplate\nof Menelaus's corslet, but the arrow glanced from off it. As black\nbeans or pulse come pattering down on to a threshing-floor from the\nbroad winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill winds and shaken by the shovel-\neven so did the arrow glance off and recoil from the shield of Menelaus,\nwho in his turn wounded the hand with which Helenus carried his bow;\nthe spear went right through his hand and stuck in the bow itself,\nso that to his life he retreated under cover of his men, with his\nhand dragging by his side- for the spear weighed it down till Agenor\ndrew it out and bound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which\nhis esquire had with him. \n\nPisander then made straight at Menelaus- his evil destiny luring him\non to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus.\nWhen the two were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus\nturned aside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield\nof brave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the\nspear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure\nof victory; forthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword and\nsprang upon him. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with\nits long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under\nhis shield, and the two made at one another. Pisander struck the peak\nof Menelaus's crested helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaus\nhit Pisander as he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at\nthe rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled\neyes fell by his feet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground,\nand Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and\nvaunted over him saying, \"Even thus shall you Trojans leave the ships\nof the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle though you be: nor\nshall you lack any of the disgrace and shame which you have heaped\nupon myself. Cowardly she-wolves that you are, you feared not the\nanger of dread Jove, avenger of violated hospitality, who will one\nday destroy your city; you stole my wedded wife and wickedly carried\noff much treasure when you were her guest, and now you would fling\nfire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. A day will come when, rage\nas you may, you shall be stayed. O father Jove, you, who they say\nart above all both gods and men in wisdom, and from whom all things\nthat befall us do proceed, how can you thus favour the Trojans- men\nso proud and overweening, that they are never tired of fighting? All\nthings pall after a while- sleep, love, sweet song, and stately dance-\nstill these are things of which a man would surely have his fill rather\nthan of battle, whereas it is of battle that the Trojans are insatiate.\"\n\nSo saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body\nof Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged himself\namong those who were in the front of the fight. \n\nHarpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come\nto fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go home again.\nHe struck the middle of Menelaus's shield with his spear but could\nnot pierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of his men,\nlooking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. But Meriones\naimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the field, and\nhit him on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through and\nthrough, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and\nbreathed his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm\nupon the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed\nfrom his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care;\nthey raised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city\nof Troy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but there\nwas no ransom that could bring his dead son to life again.\n\nParis was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host\nwhen he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore,\nin order to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor,\nson of Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was\nin Corinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that\nit would be the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus had\noften told him that he must either stay at home and die of a terrible\ndisease, or go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans;\nhe chose, therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans\nwould have laid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain\nand suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on the jaw under his\near, whereon the life went out of him and he was enshrouded in the\ndarkness of death. \n\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector had\nnot yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havoc\nof his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere\nlong would have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer\nthem on and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he\nhad first forced his way through the gates and the wall, after breaking\nthrough the serried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the\nships of Ajax and Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here\nthe wall was at its lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged\nmost fiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics,\nthe Locrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans\ncould hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could\nthey drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The chosen\nmen of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus son of Peteos,\nwith whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias: Meges son\nof Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius commanded the Epeans, while Medon\nand staunch Podarces led the men of Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard\nson to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from\nhis own country, for he had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis,\nthe wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was the son of Iphiclus son\nof Phylacus. These two stood in the van of the Phthians, and defended\nthe ships along with the Boeotians. \n\nAjax son of Oileus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son of\nTelamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the plough\nwhich they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat steams upwards\nfrom about the roots of their horns- nothing but the yoke divides\nthem as they break up the ground till they reach the end of the field-\neven so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another.\nMany and brave comrades followed the son of Telamon, to relieve him\nof his shield when he was overcome with sweat and toil, but the Locrians\ndid not follow so close after the son of Oileus, for they could not\nhold their own in a hand-to-hand fight. They had no bronze helmets\nwith plumes of horse-hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears,\nbut they had come to Troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted\nwool from which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of\nthe Trojans. The others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the\nbrunt of the fight with the Trojans and with Hector, while the Locrians\nshot from behind, under their cover; and thus the Trojans began to\nlose heart, for the arrows threw them into confusion. \n\nThe Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the ships\nand tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently said to\nHector, \"Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice. Because\nheaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, you think that\nyou must therefore excel others in counsel; but you cannot thus claim\npreeminence in all things. Heaven has made one man an excellent soldier;\nof another it has made a dancer or a singer and player on the lyre;\nwhile yet in another Jove has implanted a wise understanding of which\nmen reap fruit to the saving of many, and he himself knows more about\nit than any one; therefore I will say what I think will be best. The\nfight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now that\nthe Trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in full armour,\nwhile others are fighting scattered and outnumbered near the ships.\nDraw back, therefore, and call your chieftains round you, that we\nmay advise together whether to fall now upon the ships in the hope\nthat heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to beat a retreat while we\ncan yet safely do so. I greatly fear that the Achaeans will pay us\ntheir debt of yesterday in full, for there is one abiding at their\nships who is never weary of battle, and who will not hold aloof much\nlonger.\" \n\nThus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprang\nin full armour from his chariot and said, \"Polydamas, gather the chieftains\nhere; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return at once when\nI have given them their orders.\" \n\nHe then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loud\ncry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. When they\nheard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas the excellent\nson of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost, looking everywhere\nto find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son of Asius, and Asius\nson of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless he could no longer\nfind them, for the two last were lying by the sterns of the Achaean\nships, slain by the Argives, while the others had been also stricken\nand wounded by them; but upon the left wing of the dread battle he\nfound Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, cheering his men and urging\nthem on to fight. He went up to him and upbraided him. \"Paris,\" said\nhe, \"evil-hearted Paris, fair to see but woman-mad and false of tongue,\nwhere are Deiphobus and King Helenus? Where are Adamas son of Asius,\nand Asius son of Hyrtacus? Where too is Othryoneus? Ilius is undone\nand will now surely fall!\" \n\nAlexandrus answered, \"Hector, why find fault when there is no one\nto find fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day rather\nthan this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about\nme. From the moment when you set our men fighting about the ships\nwe have been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comrades\nabout whom you ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alone have\nleft the field, wounded both of them in the hand, but the son of Saturn\nsaved them alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us\ngo, and we will follow with right goodwill; you shall not find us\nfail you in so far as our strength holds out, but no man can do more\nthan in him lies, no matter how willing he may be.\" \n\nWith these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went towards\nthe part of the battle where the fight was thickest, about Cebriones,\nbrave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius,\nand Morys son of Hippotion, who had come from fertile Ascania on the\npreceding day to relieve other troops. Then Jove urged them on to\nfight. They flew forth like the blasts of some fierce wind that strike\nearth in the van of a thunderstorm- they buffet the salt sea into\nan uproar; many and mighty are the great waves that come crashing\nin one after the other upon the shore with their arching heads all\ncrested with foam- even so did rank behind rank of Trojans arrayed\nin gleaming armour follow their leaders onward. The way was led by\nHector son of Priam, peer of murderous Mars, with his round shield\nbefore him- his shield of ox-hides covered with plates of bronze-\nand his gleaming helmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward\nunder cover of his shield in every direction, making trial of the\nranks to see if they would give way be him, but he could not daunt\nthe courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first to stride out and\nchallenge him. \"Sir,\" he cried, \"draw near; why do you think thus\nvainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellent soldiers,\nbut the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Your heart, forsooth,\nis set on destroying our ships, but we too have bands that can keep\nyou at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner taken and sacked\nby ourselves. The time is near when you shall pray Jove and all the\ngods in your flight, that your steeds may be swifter than hawks as\nthey raise the dust on the plain and bear you back to your city.\"\n\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and the\nhost of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. But\nHector answered, \"Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I\nwere as sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, with\nQueen Juno for my mother, and of being held in like honour with Minerva\nand Apollo, as I am that this day is big with the destruction of the\nAchaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dare abide my spear;\nit shall rend your fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds\nof prey with your fat and your flesh, as you fall by the ships of\nthe Achaeans.\" \n\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after with\na cry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argives\non their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their prowess,\nbut stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojan chieftains, and\nthe cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to the brightness\nof Jove's presence. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XIV\n\nNestor was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not escape\nhim, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, \"What, noble Machaon,\nis the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our ships\ngrow stronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over your\nwine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted\nblood from off you. I will go at once to the look-out station and\nsee what it is all about.\" \n\nAs he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was\nlying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken\nhis father's shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear,\nand as soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans\nwho, now that their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before\nthe Trojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the\nwaves are dumb- they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter\nwhence the fierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where\nthey are and set neither this way nor that, till some particular wind\nsweeps down from heaven to determine them- even so did the old man\nponder whether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of\nAgamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus;\nbut meanwhile the hosts were fighting and killing one another, and\nthe hard bronze rattled on their bodies, as they thrust at one another\nwith their swords and spears. \n\nThe wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son of\nAtreus, fell in Nestor as they were coming up from their ships- for\ntheirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was going on,\nbeing on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached first,\nwhile the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch of\nthe shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the ships,\nand the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placed the\nships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the whole opening\nof the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings, leaning\non their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being in great\nanxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with dismay.\nThen King Agamemnon said to him, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to\nthe Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I fear\nthat what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among\nthe Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had fired\nour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all coming\ntrue. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in anger with\nme that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships.\"\n\nThen Nestor knight of Gerene answered, \"It is indeed as you say; it\nis all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders from\non high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we relied as\nan impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The Trojans are\nfighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you\nmay you cannot see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming;\nthey are being killed in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends\nto heaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any use, what we had\nbetter do; but I do not advise our going into battle ourselves, for\na man cannot fight when he is wounded.\" \n\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed fighting\nat the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench has\nserved us- over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they deemed\nwould be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet- I see it\nmust be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously\nhere, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to defend us, and\nI know now that he is raising the Trojans to like honour with the\ngods, while us, on the other hand, he bas bound hand and foot. Now,\ntherefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring down the ships that\nare on the beach and draw them into the water; let us make them fast\nto their mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of night-\nif even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may then\ndraw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in flying\nruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly and\nbe saved than be caught and killed.\" \n\nUlysses looked fiercely at him and said, \"Son of Atreus, what are\nyou talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other and\nbaser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a\nlife of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of\nus perish. Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win\nwhich we have suffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some\nother of the Achaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to give\ngood counsel, no king over so great a host as that of the Argives\nshould ever have let fall from his lips. I despise your judgement\nutterly for what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us draw\ndown our ships into the water while the battle is raging, and thus\nplay further into the hands of the conquering Trojans? It would be\nruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting when they see the ships\nbeing drawn into the water, but will cease attacking and keep turning\ntheir eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir captain, would\nbe our destruction.\" \n\nAgamemnon answered, \"Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart.\nI am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into\nthe sea whether they will or no. Some one, it may be, old or young,\ncan offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice to hear.\"\n\nThen said Diomed, \"Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek,\nif you will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger\nthan any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who\nlies buried at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,\nAgrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was\nthe knight Oeneus, my father's father, and he was the most valiant\nof them all. Oeeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as\nJove and the other gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married\ninto the family of Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance,\nfor he had large estates of rich corn-growing land, with much orchard\nground as well, and he had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the\nArgives in the use of the spear. You must yourselves have heard whether\nthese things are true or no; therefore when I say well despise not\nmy words as though I were a coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then,\nlet us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though we be. When\nthere, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the range of the spears\nlest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we have already, but\nwe can spur on others, who have been indulging their spleen and holding\naloof from battle hitherto.\" \n\nThus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,\nKing Agamemnon leading the way. \n\nMeanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them\nin the semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon's right hand in\nhis own and said, \"Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that\nhe sees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse-\nmay he come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself,\nthe blessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the\nprinces and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust\nupon the plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tents\ntowards their city.\" \n\nWith this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to the\nplain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine\nor ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight,\nand it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war\nand do battle without ceasing. \n\nJuno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of\nOlympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at\nonce her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither\namid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the\ntopmost crests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set herself\nto think how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed that\nit would be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in rich attire,\nin the hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, and wish to embrace\nher. While he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be\nmade to steal over his eyes and senses. \n\nShe went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made her,\nand the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a secret\nkey so that no other god could open them. Here she entered and closed\nthe doors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her fair body\nwith ambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil, ambrosial,\nvery soft, and scented specially for herself- if it were so much as\nshaken in the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervaded the\nuniverse of heaven and earth. With this she anointed her delicate\nskin, and then she plaited the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in\na stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. She put on the\nwondrous robe which Minerva had worked for her with consummate art,\nand had embroidered with manifold devices; she fastened it about her\nbosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself with a girdle that\nhad a hundred tassels: then she fastened her earrings, three brilliant\npendants that glistened most beautifully, through the pierced lobes\nof her ears, and threw a lovely new veil over her head. She bound\nher sandals on to her feet, and when she had arrayed herself perfectly\nto her satisfaction, she left her room and called Venus to come aside\nand speak to her. \"My dear child,\" said she, \"will you do what I am\ngoing to ask of you, or will refuse me because you are angry at my\nbeing on the Danaan side, while you are on the Trojan?\" \n\nJove's daughter Venus answered, \"Juno, august queen of goddesses,\ndaughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it for\nat once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.\" \n\nThen Juno told her a lying tale and said, \"I want you to endow me\nwith some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all\nthings mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world's\nend to visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys:\nthey received me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up,\nhaving taken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn\nin the depths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them\nthat I may make peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and\nare so angry that they have not slept with one another this long while;\nif I can bring them round and restore them to one another's embraces,\nthey will be grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards.\"\n\nThereon laughter-loving Venus said, \"I cannot and must not refuse\nyou, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king.\"\n\nAs she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered girdle\ninto which all her charms had been wrought- love, desire, and that\nsweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most prudent.\nShe gave the girdle to Juno and said, \"Take this girdle wherein all\nmy charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will wear it I promise\nyou that your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless.\"\n\nWhen she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the girdle\nin her bosom. \n\nVenus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down\nfrom the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair Emathia,\nand went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the Thracian\nhorsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever setting\nfoot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the, waves\nof the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas. There\nshe met Sleep, own brother to Death, and caught him by the hand, saying,\n\"Sleep, you who lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if you ever\ndid me a service in times past, do one for me now, and I shall be\ngrateful to you ever after. Close Jove's keen eyes for me in slumber\nwhile I hold him clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful\ngolden seat, that can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son Vulcan\nshall make it for you, and he shall give it a footstool for you to\nrest your fair feet upon when you are at table.\" \n\nThen Sleep answered, \"Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of\nmighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep without\ncompunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all\nof them proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep\nunless he bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what\nyou asked me, on the day when Jove's mighty son Hercules set sail\nfrom Ilius after having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding\nI suffused my sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and\nlaid him to rest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and\nset the blasts of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took\nhim to the goodly city of Cos away from all his friends. Jove was\nfurious when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the\nhouse; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would have\nflung me down through space into the sea where I should never have\nbeen heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and gods protected\nme. I fled to her and Jove left off looking for me in spite of his\nbeing so angry, for he did not dare do anything to displease Night.\nAnd now you are again asking me to do something on which I cannot\nventure.\" \n\nAnd Juno said, \"Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into\nyour head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans,\nas he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the\nyoungest of the Graces, and she shall be your own- Pasithea, whom\nyou have always wanted to marry.\" \n\nSleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, \"Then swear it\nto me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the bounteous\nearth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods\nwho dwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, and see that\nyou really do give me one of the youngest of the Graces- Pasithea,\nwhom I have always wanted to marry.\" \n\nJuno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of the\nnether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had completed\nher oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist and sped lightly\nforward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them. Presently they reached\nmany-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Lectum where they\nleft the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the trees of the forest\nsoughed under the going of their feet. Here Sleep halted, and ere\nJove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty pine-tree- the tallest\nthat reared its head towards heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind\nthe branches and sat there in the semblance of the sweet-singing bird\nthat haunts the mountains and is called Chalcis by the gods, but men\ncall it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the topmost peak of\nIda, and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as\nhe did so he became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her\nthat he had felt when they had first enjoyed each other's embraces,\nand slept with one another without their dear parents knowing anything\nabout it. He went up to her and said, \"What do you want that you have\ncome hither from Olympus- and that too with neither chariot nor horses\nto convey you?\" \n\nThen Juno told him a lying tale and said, \"I am going to the world's\nend, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mother Tethys;\nthey received me into their house, took care of me, and brought me\nup. I must go and see them that I may make peace between them: they\nhave been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not slept with\none another this long time. The horses that will take me over land\nand sea are stationed on the lowermost spurs of many-fountained Ida,\nand I have come here from Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was\nafraid you might be angry with me later on, if I went to the house\nof Oceanus without letting you know.\" \n\nAnd Jove said, \"Juno, you can choose some other time for paying your\nvisit to Oceanus- for the present let us devote ourselves to love\nand to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so overpowered\nby passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at this moment\nfor yourself- not even when I was in love with the wife of Ixion who\nbore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with Danae the\ndaintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me the famed hero Perseus.\nThen there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore me Minos and Rhadamanthus:\nthere was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot my lion-hearted\nson Hercules, while Semele became mother to Bacchus the comforter\nof mankind. There was queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and yourself-\nbut with none of these was I ever so much enamoured as I now am with\nyou.\" \n\nJuno again answered him with a lying tale. \"Most dread son of Saturn,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"what are you talking about? Would you have us enjoy\none another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can be\nseen? What if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping together,\nand tell the others? It would be such a scandal that when I had risen\nfrom your embraces I could never show myself inside your house again;\nbut if you are so minded, there is a room which your son Vulcan has\nmade me, and he has given it good strong doors; if you would so have\nit, let us go thither and lie down.\" \n\nAnd Jove answered, \"Juno, you need not be afraid that either god or\nman will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense golden\ncloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams shall not\nsee through it.\" \n\nWith this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace; whereon\nthe earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with dew-bespangled\nlotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it raised them\nwell above the ground. Here they laid themselves down and overhead\nthey were covered by a fair cloud of gold, from which there fell glittering\ndew-drops. \n\nThus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the crest\nof Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his spouse\nin his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the Achaeans,\nto tell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake. When he\nhad found him he said, \"Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaans with\na will, and give them victory though it be only for a short time while\nJove is still sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet slumber, and\nJuno has beguiled him into going to bed with her.\" \n\nSleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind, leaving\nNeptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted forward\namong the first ranks and shouted saying, \"Argives, shall we let Hector\nson of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himself\nwith glory? This is what he says that he shall now do, seeing that\nAchilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall get on very well\nwithout him if we keep each other in heart and stand by one another.\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best\nand largest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally\nforth with our longest spears in our hands; will lead you on, and\nHector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out against\nus. If any good staunch soldier has only a small shield, let him hand\nit over to a worse man, and take a larger one for himself.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of Tydeus,\nUlysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the others in\narray, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour;\nthe most valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse to the worse\nman. When they had donned their bronze armour they marched on with\nNeptune at their head. In his strong hand he grasped his terrible\nsword, keen of edge and flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes\nacross it in the day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away\nfrom it. \n\nHector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune\nand Hector waged fierce war on one another- Hector on the Trojan and\nNeptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces\nmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of the Achaeans,\nbut waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly when driven before\nthe blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roar more\nfiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor does the wind\nbellow with ruder music as it tears on through the tops of when it\nis blowing its hardest, than the terrible shout which the Trojans\nand Achaeans raised as they sprang upon one another. \n\nHector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards\nhim, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bands\npassed over his chest- the band of his shield and that of his silver-studded\nsword- and these protected his body. Hector was angry that his spear\nshould have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of his men.\nAs he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon struck him with a stone,\nof which there were many lying about under the men's feet as they\nfought- brought there to give support to the ships' sides as they\nlay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of them and struck Hector above\nthe rim of his shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin round\nlike a top and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when\nuprooted by the lightning flash of father Jove, and there is a terrible\nsmell of brimstone- no man can help being dismayed if he is standing\nnear it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing- even so did Hector\nfall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand, but\nhis shield and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze\narmour rang about him. \n\nThe sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,\nhoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,\nbut none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and covered\nby the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain of the\nLycians, and noble Glaucus: of the others, too, there was not one\nwho was unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him\nto cover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore\nhim away from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting\nfor him at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot;\nthese then took him towards the city groaning and in great pain. When\nthey reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthus, begotten of Immortal\nJove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on the\nground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathed\nagain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited blood,\nbut soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again closed\nin darkness for he was still sturined by the blow. \n\nWhen the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and\nset upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileus\nbegan by springing on Satnius son of Enops and wounding him with his\nspear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding\ncattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came\nup to him and struck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce\nfight between Trojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas\nson of Panthous drew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son\nof Areilycus on the right shoulder; the terrible spear went right\nthrough his shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the\ndust. Polydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, \"Again I take it that\nthe spear has not sped in vain from the strong hand of the son of\nPanthous; an Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve him\nfor a staff as he goes down into the house of Hades.\" \n\nThe Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon was\nmore angry than any, for the man had fallen close be, him; so he aimed\nat Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by\nswerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for\nheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the head springs\nfrom the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the\ntendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached\nthe ground long before his legs and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted\nto Polydamas saying, \"Think, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether\nthis man is not as well worth killing as Prothoenor was: he seems\nrich, and of rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight\nAntenor, for he is very like him.\" \n\nBut he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.\nAcamas then bestrode his brother's body and wounded Promachus the\nBoeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother's body\naway. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, \"Argive archers, braggarts\nthat you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only, but some\nof you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how Promachus\nnow sleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother's blood\nhas not long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he\nleaves a kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall.\"\n\nHis taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged than\nany of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not stand his\nground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master Phorbas,\nwhom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth than any\nother of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos now\nwounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from\nits socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape of\nthe neck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos\nthen drew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and\nhelmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking\nin the eye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head,\nand showed it to the Trojans, vaunting over them as he did so. \"Trojans,\"\nhe cried, \"bid the father and mother of noble Ilioneus make moan for\nhim in their house, for the wife also of Promachus son of Alegenor\nwill never be gladdened by the coming of her dear husband- when we\nArgives return with our ships from Troy.\" \n\nAs he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about\nto see whither he might fly for safety. \n\nTell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the\nArgives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of the\nearthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was\nfirst to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.\nAntilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morys\nand Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son\nof Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank,\nand the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among\nthem; on this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where\nhe had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son\nof Oileus killed more than any other, for there was no man so fleet\nas he to pursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XV\n\nBut when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set\nstakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojans\nmade a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear.\nJove now woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying with golden-throned\nJuno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw the Trojans and\nAchaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others driving them\npell-mell before them with King Neptune in their midst. He saw Hector\nlying on the ground with his comrades gathered round him, gasping\nfor breath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, for it was not the\nfeeblest of the Achaeans who struck him. \n\nThe sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on Juno.\n\"I see, Juno,\" said he, \"you mischief- making trickster, that your\ncunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout of\nhis host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will\nbe the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not\nremember how once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two anvils\non to your feet, and bound your hands in a chain of gold which none\nmight break, and you hung in mid-air among the clouds. All the gods\nin Olympus were in a fury, but they could not reach you to set you\nfree; when I caught any one of them I gripped him and hurled him from\nthe heavenly threshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even\nthis did not relieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which I felt\nabout noble Hercules whom you and Boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond\nthe seas to Cos, after suborning the tempests; but I rescued him,\nand notwithstanding all his mighty labours I brought him back again\nto Argos. I would remind you of this that you may learn to leave off\nbeing so deceitful, and discover how much you are likely to gain by\nthe embraces out of which you have come here to trick me.\"\n\nJuno trembled as he spoke, and said, \"May heaven above and earth below\nbe my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx- and this is the\nmost solemn oath that a blessed god can take- nay, I swear also by\nyour own almighty head and by our bridal bed- things over which I\ncould never possibly perjure myself- that Neptune is not punishing\nHector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing\nof mine; it is all of his own mere motion because he was sorry to\nsee the Achaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him,\nI should tell him to do as you bid him.\" \n\nThe sire of gods and men smiled and answered, \"If you, Juno, were\nalways to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune,\nlike it or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking.\nIf, then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among\nthe rank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the\nbow, that I want them- Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and\ntell Neptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he\nmay send Hector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he\nwill thus forget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back\nin confusion till they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus.\nAchilles will then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and Hector\nwill kill him in front of Ilius after he has slain many warriors,\nand among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill Hector\nto avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it about that\nthe Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back till they fulfil\nthe counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will not stay my anger,\nnor permit any god to help the Danaans till I have accomplished the\ndesire of the son of Peleus, according to the promise I made by bowing\nmy head on the day when Thetis touched my knees and besought me to\ngive him honour.\" \n\nJuno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great Olympus.\nSwift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vast continents,\nand he says to himself, \"Now I will be here, or there,\" and he would\nhave all manner of things- even so swiftly did Juno wing her way till\nshe came to high Olympus and went in among the gods who were gathered\nin the house of Jove. When they saw her they all of them came up to\nher, and held out their cups to her by way of greeting. She let the\nothers be, but took the cup offered her by lovely Themis, who was\nfirst to come running up to her. \"Juno,\" said she, \"why are you here?\nAnd you seem troubled- has your husband the son of Saturn been frightening\nyou?\" \n\nAnd Juno answered, \"Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what\na proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to table,\nwhere you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs which\nhe has avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will be angered by\nthem, however peaceably he may be feasting now.\" \n\nOn this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the house\nof Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with care,\nand she spoke up in a rage. \"Fools that we are,\" she cried, \"to be\nthus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up to him and\nstay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and cares for\nnobody, for he knows that he is much stronger than any other of the\nimmortals. Make the best, therefore, of whatever ills he may choose\nto send each one of you; Mars, I take it, has had a taste of them\nalready, for his son Ascalaphus has fallen in battle- the man whom\nof all others he loved most dearly and whose father he owns himself\nto be.\" \n\nWhen he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat\nof his hands, and said in anger, \"Do not blame me, you gods that dwell\nin heaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death\nof my son, even though it end in my being struck by Jove's lightning\nand lying in blood and dust among the corpses.\" \n\nAs he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout, while\nhe put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused to still\nmore fierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals, had\nnot Minerva, ararmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her seat\nand hurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and the shield\nfrom his shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from his strong\nhand and set it on one side; then she said to Mars, \"Madman, you are\nundone; you have ears that hear not, or you have lost all judgement\nand understanding; have you not heard what Juno has said on coming\nstraight from the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish to go through\nall kinds of suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry\nto Olympus, after having caused infinite mischief to all us others?\nJove would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves;\nhe would come to Olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one after\nanother, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay aside your anger for\nthe death of your son; better men than he have either been killed\nalready or will fall hereafter, and one cannot protect every one's\nwhole family.\" \n\nWith these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno called\nApollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. \"Jove,\" she said\nto them, \"desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; when you have\nseen him you are to do as he may then bid you.\" \n\nThereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris and\nApollo made all haste on their way. When they reached many-fountained\nIda, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seated on topmost Gargarus\nwith a fragrant cloud encircling his head as with a diadem. They stood\nbefore his presence, and he was pleased with them for having been\nso quick in obeying the orders his wife had given them. \n\nHe spoke to Iris first. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, tell King Neptune\nwhat I now bid you- and tell him true. Bid him leave off fighting,\nand either join the company of the gods, or go down into the sea.\nIf he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider well whether\nhe is strong enough to hold his own against me if I attack him. I\nam older and much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid to set\nhimself up as on a level with myself, of whom all the other gods stand\nin awe.\" \n\nIris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or snowflakes\nthat fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas, even so did\nshe wing her way till she came close up to the great shaker of the\nearth. Then she said, \"I have come, O dark-haired king that holds\nthe world in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove. He bids\nyou leave off fighting, and either join the company of the gods or\ngo down into the sea; if, however, you take no heed and disobey him,\nhe says he will come down here and fight you. He would have you keep\nout of his reach, for he is older and much stronger than you are,\nand yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself,\nof whom all the other gods stand in awe.\" \n\nNeptune was very angry and said, \"Great heavens! strong as Jove may\nbe, he has said more than he can do if he has threatened violence\nagainst me, who am of like honour with himself. We were three brothers\nwhom Rhea bore to Saturn- Jove, myself, and Hades who rules the world\nbelow. Heaven and earth were divided into three parts, and each of\nus was to have an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell to me to\nhave my dwelling in the sea for evermore; Hades took the darkness\nof the realms under the earth, while air and sky and clouds were the\nportion that fell to Jove; but earth and great Olympus are the common\nproperty of all. Therefore I will not walk as Jove would have me.\nFor all his strength, let him keep to his own third share and be contented\nwithout threatening to lay hands upon me as though I were nobody.\nLet him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters, who\nmust perforce obey him. \n\nIris fleet as the wind then answered, \"Am I really, Neptune, to take\nthis daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsider\nyour answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know that\nthe Erinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person.\"\n\nNeptune answered, \"Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in season.\nIt is well when a messenger shows so much discretion. Nevertheless\nit cuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke so angrily\nanother who is his own peer, and of like empire with himself. Now,\nhowever, I will give way in spite of my displeasure; furthermore let\nme tell you, and I mean what I say- if contrary to the desire of myself,\nMinerva driver of the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King Vulcan, Jove\nspares steep Ilius, and will not let the Achaeans have the great triumph\nof sacking it, let him understand that he will incur our implacable\nresentment.\" \n\nNeptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely did\nthe Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, \"Go, dear Phoebus,\nto Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has now\ngone down under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure. Had\nhe not done so those gods who are below with Saturn would have come\nto hear of the fight between us. It is better for both of us that\nhe should have curbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for I should\nhave had much trouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis,\nand shake it furiously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic;\ntake, moreover, brave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and\nrouse him to deeds of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back\nto their ships and to the Hellespont. From that point I will think\nit well over, how the Achaeans may have a respite from their troubles.\"\n\nApollo obeyed his father's saying, and left the crests of Ida, flying\nlike a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He found Hector\nno longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he had just come\nto himself again. He knew those who were about him, and the sweat\nand hard breathing had left him from the moment when the will of aegis-bearing\nJove had revived him. Apollo stood beside him and said, \"Hector, son\nof Priam, why are you so faint, and why are you here away from the\nothers? Has any mishap befallen you?\" \n\nHector in a weak voice answered, \"And which, kind sir, of the gods\nare you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me\non the chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships\nof the Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure\nthat this very day I should breathe my last and go down into the house\nof Hades.\" \n\nThen King Apollo said to him, \"Take heart; the son of Saturn has sent\nyou a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, even\nme, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian hitherto\nnot only of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore, order your\nhorsemen to drive their chariots to the ships in great multitudes.\nI will go before your horses to smooth the way for them, and will\nturn the Achaeans in flight.\" \n\nAs he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his people.\nAnd as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallops gloriously\nover the plain to the place where he is wont to take his bath in the\nriver- he tosses his head, and his mane streams over his shoulders\nas in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to the pastures\nwhere the mares are feeding- even so Hector, when he heard what the\ngod said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward as fast as his limbs\ncould take him. As country peasants set their hounds on to a homed\nstag or wild goat- he has taken shelter under rock or thicket, and\nthey cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shouts have\nroused stands in their path, and they are in no further humour for\nthe chase- even so the Achaeans were still charging on in a body,\nusing their swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they\nsaw Hector going about among his men they were afraid, and their hearts\nfell down into their feet. \n\nThen spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man\nwho could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,\nwhile few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided.\nHe then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: \"What,\nin heaven's name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again?\nEvery one made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but\nit seems that one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killed\nmany of us Danaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the\nhand of Jove must be with him or he would never dare show himself\nso masterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us\nall do as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall\nback upon the ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower\nof the army stand firm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back\nat the point of our spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive\nthat he will then think better of it before he tries to charge into\nthe press of the Danaans.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who were\nabout Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of Teucer, Meriones,\nand Meges peer of Mars called all their best men about them and sustained\nthe fight against Hector and the Trojans, but the main body fell back\nupon the ships of the Achaeans. \n\nThe Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding\non at their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloud\nabout his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with its shaggy\nfringe, which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to strike terror into\nthe hearts of men. With this in his hand he led on the Trojans.\n\nThe Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of battle\nrose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the bowstrings.\nMany a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the bodies of\nmany a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway, before\nthey could taste of man's fair flesh and glut themselves with blood.\nSo long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and without shaking\nit, the weapons on either side took effect and the people fell, but\nwhen he shook it straight in the face of the Danaans and raised his\nmighty battle-cry their hearts fainted within them and they forgot\ntheir former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in the dead of\nnight on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman\nis not there- even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for Apollo\nfilled them with panic and gave victory to Hector and the Trojans.\n\nThe fight then became more scattered and they killed one another where\nthey best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one, leader\nof the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of Menestheus.\nAeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard son to Oileus,\nand brother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own country,\nfor he had killed a man, a kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom\nOileus had married. Iasus had become a leader of the Athenians, and\nwas son of Sphelus the son of Boucolos. Polydamas killed Mecisteus,\nand Polites Echius, in the front of the battle, while Agenor slew\nClonius. Paris struck Deiochus from behind in the lower part of the\nshoulder, as he was flying among the foremost, and the point of the\nspear went clean through him. \n\nWhile they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the Achaeans\nwere flying pellmell to the trench and the set stakes, and were forced\nback within their wall. Hector then cried out to the Trojans, \"Forward\nto the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see any man keeping back\non the other side the wall away from the ships I will have him killed:\nhis kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire, but\ndogs shall tear him in pieces in front of our city.\" \n\nAs he spoke he laid his whip about his horses' shoulders and called\nto the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted with a\ncry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with his\nown. Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the banks of the\ndeep trench into its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as\nbroad as the throw of a spear when a man is trying his strength. The\nTrojan battalions poured over the bridge, and Apollo with his redoubtable\naegis led the way. He kicked down the wall of the Achaeans as easily\nas a child who playing on the sea-shore has built a house of sand\nand then kicks it down again and destroys it- even so did you, O Apollo,\nshed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with panic and\nconfusion. \n\nThus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out\nto one another and raising their hands with loud cries every man to\nheaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted\nup his hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently\nthan any of them. \"Father Jove,\" said he, \"if ever any one in wheat-growing\nArgos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer and prayed that\nhe might return safely home, whereon you bowed your head to him in\nassent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans to triumph\nthus over the Achaeans.\" \n\nAll counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to die prayer of the\naged son of Neleus. When the heard Jove thunder they flung themselves\nyet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking over the bulwarks\nof a ship when the sea runs high before a gale- for it is the force\nof the wind that makes the waves so great- even so did the Trojans\nspring over the wall with a shout, and drive their chariots onwards.\nThe two sides fought with their double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand\nencounter-the Trojans from their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing\nup into their ships and wielding the long pikes that were lying on\nthe decks ready for use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod with bronze.\n\nNow Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting about\nthe wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships, remained sitting\nin the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him with his conversation\nand spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain. When, however,\nhe saw the Trojans swarming through the breach in the wall, while\nthe Achaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, he cried aloud,\nand smote his two thighs with the flat of his hands. \"Eurypylus,\"\nsaid he in his dismay, \"I know you want me badly, but I cannot stay\nwith you any longer, for there is hard fighting going on; a servant\nshall take care of you now, for I must make all speed to Achilles,\nand induce him to fight if I can; who knows but with heaven's help\nI may persuade him. A man does well to listen to the advice of a friend.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm and\nresisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer in\nnumber, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither could\nthe Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among the\ntents and ships. As a carpenter's line gives a true edge to a piece\nof ship's timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva\nhas instructed in all kinds of useful arts- even so level was the\nissue of the fight between the two sides, as they fought some round\none and some round another. \n\nHector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about the\nsame ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor\nyet could Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought\nhim. \n\nThen Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear\nas he was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the ground\nand the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen\nin front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,\n\"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a\njot, but rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of\nhis armour now that he has fallen.\" \n\nHe then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit Lycophron\na follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was living with Ajax\ninasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans. Hector's spear\nstruck him on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from the\nship's prow on to the ground with no life left in him. Ajax shook\nwith rage and said to his brother, \"Teucer, my good fellow, our trusty\ncomrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came to live with us from\nCythera and whom we honoured as much as our own parents. Hector has\njust killed him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which\nPhoebus Apollo gave you.\" \n\nTeucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver\nin his hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and\nhit Cleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son\nof Panthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to his\nhorses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,\ndoing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now come\nupon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avert\nit, for the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from\nhis chariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside.\nKing Polydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up\nto the horses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon,\nand ordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He\nthen went back and took his place in the front ranks. \n\nTeucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have been\nno more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him then\nand there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyes\non Teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring\nfor him just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim; on this\nthe arrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands. Teucer shook\nwith anger and said to his brother, \"Alas, see how heaven thwarts\nus in all we do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from\nmy hand, though I strung it this selfsame morning that it might serve\nme for many an arrow.\" \n\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \"My good fellow, let your bow and your\narrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite the Danaans.\nTake your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both fight\nthe Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may be successful\nfor the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find it a hard\nmatter to take the ships.\" \n\nTeucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield\nfour hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set\nhis helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\nabove it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and forthwith\nhe was by the side of Ajax. \n\nWhen Hector saw that Teucer's bow was of no more use to him, he shouted\nout to the Trojans and Lycians, \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians\ngood in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your mettle here\nat the ships, for I see the weapon of one of their chieftains made\nuseless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see when Jove is helping\npeople and means to help them still further, or again when he is bringing\nthem down and will do nothing for them; he is now on our side, and\nis going against the Argives. Therefore swarm round the ships and\nfight. If any of you is struck by spear or sword and loses his life,\nlet him die; he dies with honour who dies fighting for his country;\nand he will leave his wife and children safe behind him, with his\nhouse and allotment unplundered if only the Achaeans can be driven\nback to their own land, they and their ships.\" \n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the\nother side exhorted his comrades saying, \"Shame on you Argives, we\nare now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the\nenemy from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you\nwill be able to get home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on\nhis whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they\nare not at a dance but in battle? Our only course is to fight them\nwith might and main; we had better chance it, life or death, once\nfor all, than fight long and without issue hemmed in at our ships\nby worse men than ourselves.\" \n\nWith these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then killed\nSchedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajax killed\nLaodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamas killed\nOtus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of the proud\nEpeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but Polydamas crouched\ndown, and he missed him, for Apollo would not suffer the son of Panthous\nto fall in battle; but the spear hit Croesmus in the middle of his\nchest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped him\nof his armour. At that moment the valiant soldier Dolops son of Lampus\nsprang upon Lampus was son of Laomedon and for his valour, while his\nson Dolops was versed in all the ways of war. He then struck the middle\nof the son of Phyleus' shield with his spear, setting on him at close\nquarters, but his good corslet made with plates of metal saved him;\nPhyleus had brought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where his\nhost, King Euphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect\nhim. It now served to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck\nthe topmost crest of Dolops's bronze helmet with his spear and tore\naway its plume of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet\nas it was it tumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting\nand confident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got\nby the side of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder,\nfrom behind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into\nhis chest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him\nto strip him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers\nfor help, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon,\nwho erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before\nthe war broke out; but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went\nback to Ilius, where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near\nPriam who treated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him\nand said, \"Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note\nof the death of your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying\nto take Dolops's armour? Follow me; there must be no fighting the\nArgives from a distance now, but we must do so in close combat till\neither we kill them or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her\npeople.\" \n\nHe led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after. Meanwhile\nAjax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. \"My friends,\" he\ncried, \"be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves in battle so as\nto win respect from one another. Men who respect each other's good\nopinion are less likely to be killed than those who do not, but in\nflight there is neither gain nor glory.\" \n\nThus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back the\nTrojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with\na wall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of the\nloud battle-cry urged Antilochus on. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"you are\nyoung and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more\nvaliant than you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and\nkill him.\" \n\nHe hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once darted\nout from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking carefully\nround him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart did not\nspeed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippus the proud\nson of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming forward,\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\nAntilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn which a hunter\nhas hit as it was breaking away from its covert, and killed it. Even\nso, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus spring upon you to strip\nyou of your armour; but noble Hector marked him, and came running\nup to him through the thick of the battle. Antilochus, brave soldier\nthough he was, would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage\ncreature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed\na dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can\nbe gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor fly, and the\nTrojans and Hector with a cry that rent the air showered their weapons\nafter him; nor did he turn round and stay his flight till he had reached\nhis comrades. \n\nThe Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the ships\nin fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them on to\nnew deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argives\nand defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving\nglory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the\nships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had\nmade him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he should see the glare\nof a blazing ship. From that hour he was about so to order that the\nTrojans should be driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory\nto the Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam,\nwho was cager enough already, to assail the ships. His fury was as\nthat of Mars, or as when a fire is raging in the glades of some dense\nforest upon the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared\nunder his terrible eye-brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples\nby reason of the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was with\nhim, and though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory\nand glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already Pallas\nMinerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands of\nthe son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to break the ranks\nof the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in the goodliest\narmour; but do what he might he could not break through them, for\nthey stood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff rising from\nthe grey sea that braves the anger of the gale, and of the waves that\nthunder up against it. He fell upon them like flames of fire from\nevery quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high by wind and storm,\nbreaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roar\nagainst the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, and\nthey are saved but by a very little from destruction- even so were\nthe hearts of the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lion\nattacking a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the\nlow-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore- the herdsman is at his\nwit's end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now in the\nvan and now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion springs into\nthe thick of them and fastens on a cow so that they all tremble for\nfear- even so were the Achaeans utterly panic-stricken by Hector and\nfather Jove. Nevertheless Hector only killed Periphetes of Mycenae;\nhe was son of Copreus who was wont to take the orders of King Eurystheus\nto mighty Hercules, but the son was a far better man than the father\nin every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior, and in understanding\nranked among the foremost men of Mycenae. He it was who then afforded\nHector a triumph, for as he was turning back he stumbled against the\nrim of his shield which reached his feet, and served to keep the javelins\noff him. He tripped against this and fell face upward, his helmet\nringing loudly about his head as he did so. Hector saw him fall and\nran up to him; he then thrust a spear into his chest, and killed him\nclose to his own comrades. These, for all their sorrow, could not\nhelp him for they were themselves terribly afraid of Hector.\n\nThey had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had been\ndrawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans came pouring\nafter them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of ships,\nbut they made a stand by their tents without being broken up and scattered;\nshame and fear restrained them. They kept shouting incessantly to\none another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans,\nwas loudest in imploring every man by his parents, and beseeching\nhim to stand firm. \n\n\"Be men, my friends,\" he cried, \"and respect one another's good opinion.\nThink, all of you, on your children, your wives, your property, and\nyour parents whether these be alive or dead. On their behalf though\nthey are not here, I implore you to stand firm, and not to turn in\nflight.\" \n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva lifted\nthe thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon\nthem, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight was\nraging. They could see Hector and all his men, both those in the rear\nwho were taking no part in the battle, and those who were fighting\nby the ships. \n\nAjax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but strode\nfrom deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve cubits\nlong and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of horsemanship\ncouples four horses together and comes tearing full speed along the\npublic way from the country into some large town- many both men and\nwomen marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time changing his\nhorse, springing from one to another without ever missing his feet\nwhile the horses are at a gallop- even so did Ajax go striding from\none ship's deck to another, and his voice went up into the heavens.\nHe kept on shouting his orders to the Danaans and exhorting them to\ndefend their ships and tents; neither did Hector remain within the\nmain body of the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle swoops down upon\na flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river-geese, it may be, or cranes,\nor long-necked swans- even so did Hector make straight for a dark-prowed\nship, rushing right towards it; for Jove with his mighty hand impelled\nhim forward, and roused his people to follow him. \n\nAnd now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would have\nthought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely did\nthey fight; and this was the mind in which they were- the Achaeans\ndid not believe they should escape destruction but thought themselves\ndoomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat high with\nthe hope of firing the ships and putting the Achaean heroes to the\nsword. \n\nThus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of the\ngood ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore him\nback to his native land. Round this ship there raged a close hand-to-hand\nfight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fight at a distance\nwith bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at one another in\nclose combat with their mighty swords and spears pointed at both ends;\nthey fought moreover with keen battle-axes and with hatchets. Many\na good stout blade hilted and scabbarded with iron, fell from hand\nor shoulder as they fought, and the earth ran red with blood. Hector,\nwhen he had seized the ship, would not loose his hold but held on\nto its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans, \"Bring fire, and raise\nthe battle-cry all of you with a single voice. Now has Jove vouchsafed\nus a day that will pay us for all the rest; this day we shall take\nthe ships which came hither against heaven's will, and which have\ncaused us such infinite suffering through the cowardice of our councillors,\nwho when I would have done battle at the ships held me back and forbade\nthe host to follow me; if Jove did then indeed warp our judgements,\nhimself now commands me and cheers me on.\" \n\nAs he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the Achaeans,\nand Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome by the darts\nthat were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed. Therefore\nhe left the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to the seven-foot\nbench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out, and with his\nspear held back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the ships. All\nthe time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice and exhorting\nthe Danaans. \"My friends,\" he cried, \"Danaan heroes, servants of Mars,\nbe men my friends, and fight with might and with main. Can we hope\nto find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely than\nthe one we have? There is no strong city within reach, whence we may\ndraw fresh forces to turn the scales in our favour. We are on the\nplain of the armed Trojans with the sea behind us, and far from our\nown country. Our salvation, therefore, is in the might of our hands\nand in hard fighting.\" \n\nAs he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when\nany Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector's bidding, he\nwould be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long spear.\nTwelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the ships.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XVI\n\nThus did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus\ndrew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some\nspring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice.\nWhen Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said,\n\"Why, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child\nthat comes running to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried-\nshe catches hold of her mother's dress to stay her though she is in\na hurry, and looks tearfully up until her mother carries her- even\nsuch tears, Patroclus, are you now shedding. Have you anything to\nsay to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthia\nwhich you alone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is still\nalive, as also Peleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons- men whose\nloss we two should bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the\nArgives and the way in which they are being killed at the ships, throu\ntheir own high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell\nme that both of us may know about it.\" \n\nThen, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered, \"Achilles,\nson of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not be angry,\nbut I weep for the disaster that has now befallen the Argives. All\nthose who have been their champions so far are lying at the ships,\nwounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus has been hit\nwith a spear, while famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have received sword-wounds;\nEurypylus again has been struck with an arrow in the thigh; skilled\napothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healing them of their\nwounds; are you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it never be\nmy lot to nurse such a passion as you have done, to the baning of\nyour own good name. Who in future story will speak well of you unless\nyou now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity; knight Peleus\nwas not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the grey sea bore\nyou and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel and remorseless are you.\nIf however you are kept back through knowledge of some oracle, or\nif your mother Thetis has told you something from the mouth of Jove,\nat least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if I may bring deliverance\nto the Danaans. Let me moreover wear your armour; the Trojans may\nthus mistake me for you and quit the field, so that the hard-pressed\nsons of the Achaeans may have breathing time- which while they are\nfighting may hardly be. We who are fresh might soon drive tired men\nback from our ships and tents to their own city.\" \n\nHe knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own\ndestruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, \"What, noble\nPatroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding,\nnor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove, but I am\ncut to the very heart that one of my own rank should dare to rob me\nbecause he is more powerful than I am. This, after all that I have\ngone through, is more than I can endure. The girl whom the sons of\nthe Achaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spear on\nhaving sacked a city- her has King Agamemnon taken from me as though\nI were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no man\nmay keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till battle\nand the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird\nmy armour about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle,\nfor the dark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet;\nthe Argives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow\nspace, and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out against\nthem, because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near them.\nHad they seen this, there would not have been a creek nor grip that\nhad not been filled with their dead as they fled back again. And so\nit would have been, if only King Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me.\nAs it is the Trojans have beset our host. Diomed son of Tydeus no\nlonger wields his spear to defend the Danaans, neither have I heard\nthe voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hated head, whereas\nthat of murderous Hector rings in my cars as he gives orders to the\nTrojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill the whole plain with\ntheir cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fall upon them and save\nthe fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent us from being able\nto return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that you may win me great\nhonour from all the Danaans, and that they may restore the girl to\nme again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When you have driven\nthe Trojans from the ships, come back again. Though Juno's thundering\nhusband should put triumph within your reach, do not fight the Trojans\nfurther in my absence, or you will rob me of glory that should be\nmine. And do not for lust of battle go on killing the Trojans nor\nlead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of the ever-living gods from\nOlympus attack you- for Phoebus Apollo loves them well: return when\nyou have freed the ships from peril, and let others wage war upon\nthe plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that not a\nsingle man of all the Trojans might be left alive, nor yet of the\nArgives, but that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle\nthat veils the brow of Troy.\" \n\nThus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground for\nthe shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and the\njavelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed\nabout his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missiles\nthat kept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected\nhis face. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his\nshield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, they\ncould not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the\nsweat rained from every pore of his body, he had not a moment's respite,\nand on all sides he was beset by danger upon danger. \n\nAnd now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how\nfire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close\nup and let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax.\nHe cut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened on\nto the shaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a\nheadless spear, while the bronze point flew some way off and came\nringing down on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this,\nand was dismayed at seeing that Jove had now left him utterly defenceless\nand was willing victory for the Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and\nthe Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped in\nflame. \n\nThe fire was now flaring about the ship's stern, whereon Achilles\nsmote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, \"Up, noble knight, for\nI see the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy\nour ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on your\narmour at once while I call our people together.\" \n\nAs he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legs\nwith greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver;\nafter this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaid\nand studded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his\nshoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his\nhelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\nabove it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited his hands,\nbut he did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout and strong,\nfor none other of the Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles could\ndo so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion, which Chiron\nhad cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to\ndeal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his horses with\nall speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour next after Achilles,\nand on whose support in battle he could rely most firmly. Automedon\ntherefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius, steeds that could\nfly like the wind: these were they whom the harpy Podarge bore to\nthe west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of the\nriver Oceanus. In the side traces he set the noble horse Pedasus,\nwhom Achilles had brought away with him when he sacked the city of\nEetion, and who, mortal steed though he was, could take his place\nalong with those that were immortal. \n\nMeanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade\nhis Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves\nthat are feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the\nmountains, and their jaws are red with blood- they go in a pack to\nlap water from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and\nthey reek of blood and slaughter; they know not what fear is, for\nit is hunger drives them- even so did the leaders and counsellors\nof the Myrmidons gather round the good squire of the fleet descendant\nof Aeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both\nmen and horses. \n\nFifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there\nwas a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom\nhe could trust, while he was himself commander over them all. Menesthius\nof the gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius that streams\nfrom heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair Polydora daughter\nof Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheius- a woman mated with\na god- but he was called son of Borus son of Perieres, with whom his\nmother was living as his wedded wife, and who gave great wealth to\ngain her. The second company was led by noble Eudorus, son to an unwedded\nwoman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas the graceful dancer, bore him;\nthe mighty slayer of Argos was enamoured of her as he saw her among\nthe singing women at a dance held in honour of Diana the rushing huntress\nof the golden arrows; he therefore- Mercury, giver of all good- went\nwith her into an upper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon\nshe bore him a noble son Eudorus, singularly fleet of foot and in\nfight valiant. When Ilithuia goddess of the pains of child-birth brought\nhim to the light of day, and he saw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles\nson of Actor took the mother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain\nher, but her father Phylas brought the child up, and took care of\nhim, doting as fondly upon him as though he were his own son. The\nthird company was led by Pisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman\namong all the Myrmidons next to Achilles' own comrade Patroclus. The\nold knight Phoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon,\nnoble son of Laerceus of the fifth. \n\nWhen Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with their\ncaptains, he charged them straitly saying, \"Myrmidons, remember your\nthreats against the Trojans while you were at the ships in the time\nof my anger, and you were all complaining of me. 'Cruel son of Peleus,'\nyou would say, 'your mother must have suckled you on gall, so ruthless\nare you. You keep us here at the ships against our will; if you are\nso relentless it were better we went home over the sea.' Often have\nyou gathered and thus chided with me. The hour is now come for those\nhigh feats of arms that you have so long been pining for, therefore\nkeep high hearts each one of you to do battle with the Trojans.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they serried\ntheir companies yet more closely when they heard the of their king.\nAs the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high house\nwhich is to give shelter from the winds- even so closely were the\nhelmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield pressed\non shield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they that the\nhorse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched\neach other as they bent their heads. \n\nIn front of them all two men put on their armour- Patroclus and Automedon-\ntwo men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then Achilles went\ninside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest which silver-footed\nThetis had given him to take on board ship, and which she had filled\nwith shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and good thick rugs. In\nthis chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which no man but\nhimself might drink, nor would he make offering from it to any other\ngod save only to father Jove. He took the cup from the chest and cleansed\nit with sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, and after he\nhad washed his hands he drew wine. Then he stood in the middle of\nthe court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making his drink-offering\nof wine; nor was he unseen of Jove whose joy is in thunder. \"King\nJove,\" he cried, \"lord of Dodona, god of the Pelasgi, who dwellest\nafar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your sway, where your prophets\nthe Selli dwell around you with their feet unwashed and their couches\nmade upon the ground- if you heard me when I prayed to you aforetime,\nand did me honour while you sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe\nme now the fulfilment of yet this further prayer. I shall stay here\nwhere my ships are lying, but I shall send my comrade into battle\nat the head of many Myrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory\nmay go with him; put your courage into his heart that Hector may learn\nwhether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether his might\nis only then so indomitable when I myself enter the turmoil of war.\nAfterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of battle from\nthe ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with his armour and\nhis comrades, fighters in close combat.\" \n\nThus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part\nof it he did indeed vouchsafe him- but not the whole. He granted that\nPatroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but refused\nto let him come safely out of the fight. \n\nWhen he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles\nwent inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.\n\nThen he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce\nfight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans. \n\nMeanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till\nthey sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out\nlike wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children\nlove to tease, whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung-\nor again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident,\nevery wasp will come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones-\neven with such rage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their\nships, and their cry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus called\nout to his men at the top of his voice, \"Myrmidons, followers of Achilles\nson of Peleus, be men my friends, fight with might and with main,\nthat we may win glory for the son of Peleus, who is far the foremost\nman at the ships of the Argives- he, and his close fighting followers.\nThe son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing\nno respect to the bravest of the Achaeans.\" \n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they fell\nin a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the cry which\nthe Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son of Menoetius\nand his squire all gleaming in their armour, they were daunted and\ntheir battalions were thrown into confusion, for they thought the\nfleet son of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, and have been\nreconciled to Agamemnon; every one, therefore, looked round about\nto see whither he might fly for safety. \n\nPatroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where men\nwere packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus.\nHe hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon\nand the broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on the\nright shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on\nthis his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader,\nwho was the finest soldier among them, Patroclus struck panic into\nthem all. He thus drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that\nwas then blazing- leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was.\nThe Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent the skies,\nwhile the Danaans poured after them from their ships, shouting also\nwithout ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the thunder-cloud, spreads\na dense canopy on the top of some lofty mountain, and all the peaks,\nthe jutting headlands, and forest glades show out in the great light\nthat flashes from the bursting heavens, even so when the Danaans had\nnow driven back the fire from their ships, they took breath for a\nlittle while; but the fury of the fight was not yet over, for the\nTrojans were not driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle,\nand were ousted from their ground only by sheer fighting.\n\nThe fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed one\nanother when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius first\ndrove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was turning\nround; the point went clean through, and broke the bone so that he\nfell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest, where\nit was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The son\nof Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he could do\nso took aim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles are\nthicker than in any other part; the spear tore through all the sinews\nof the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sons of Nestor\none, Antilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point of the spear\nthrough his throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang on Antilochus\nin hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body\nspear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him, and\nin a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow;\nhis aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root\nof his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell heavily\nto the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did these\ntwo noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain by the two\nsons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of Amisodorus, who had\nreared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. Ajax son of Oileus\nsprang on Cleobulus and took him alive as he was entangled in the\ncrush; but he killed him then and there by a sword-blow on the neck.\nThe sword reeked with his blood, while dark death and the strong hand\nof fate gripped him and closed his eyes. \n\nPeneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed each\nother with their spears. They had both thrown without effect, so now\nthey drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest of Peneleos'\nhelmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote Lycon\non the neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the head was\nheld on by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life left in\nhim. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on foot and caught him up just\nas he was about to mount his chariot; he drove a spear through his\nright shoulder so that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyes\nwere closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the\nbronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the brain,\ncrashing in among the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth\nwere all of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream\nfrom both his eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils,\nand the darkness of death enfolded him round about. \n\nThus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his man.\nAs ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when\nthey are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock\nthrough the carelessness of the shepherd- and when the wolves see\nthis they pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves-\neven so did the Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with ill-omened\ncries in their panic and had no more fight left in them.\n\nMeanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector,\nbut Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well under\ncover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the whizzing\nof the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He well knew that\nthe fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood his ground and\ntried to protect his comrades. \n\nAs when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a\nclear sky when Jove is brewing a gale- even with such panic stricken\nrout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going.\nHector's fleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and\nhe left the Trojan host penned in by the deep trench against their\nwill. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in\nthe trench and left their master's car behind them. Patroclus gave\nchase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against\nthe Trojans, who, being now no longer in a body, filled all the ways\nwith their cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened with the\nclouds of dust they raised, and the horses strained every nerve in\ntheir flight from the tents and ships towards the city. \n\nPatroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying\nin confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were being smashed\nin all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from his own\ncar to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whose immortal\nsteeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench at a bound\nas they sped onward. He was intent on trying to get near Hector, for\nhe had set his heart on spearing him, but Hector's horses were now\nhurrying him away. As the whole dark earth bows before some tempest\non an autumn day when Jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving\ncrooked judgement in their courts, and arriving justice therefrom\nwithout heed to the decrees of heaven- all the rivers run full and\nthe torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong from the\nmountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of men-\neven such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in their\nflight. \n\nPatroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and\ndrove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach\nthe city, but he would not Yet them, and bore down on them between\nthe river and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he then\navenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it was\nexposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground.\nNext he sprang on Thestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled\nup in his chariot, for he had lost his head and the reins had been\ntorn out of his hands. Patroclus went up to him and drove a spear\ninto his right jaw; he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear\npulled him over the rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of\nsome jutting rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook\nand a line- even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping\nfrom his chariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while\nfalling. On this, as Erylaus was on to attack him, he struck him full\non the head with a stone, and his brains were all battered inside\nhis helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of\ndeath took hold upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas,\nAmphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris, lpheus,\nEuippus and Polymelus son of Argeas. \n\nNow when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,\nbeing overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycians\nsaying. \"Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle;\nI will myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so\nmasterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a brave\nman upon the ground.\" \n\nHe sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he saw\nthis, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one another\nwith loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that scream\nand tear at one another in some high mountain fastness. \n\nThe son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said\nto Juno who was his wife and sister, \"Alas, that it should be the\nlot of Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of Patroclus.\nI am in two minds whether to catch him up out of the fight and set\nhim down safe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, or to let him\nnow fall by the hand of the son of Menoetius.\" \n\nAnd Juno answered, \"Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that you\nare saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long been\nfated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall not\nall of us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to your\nheart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other\nof the gods will be also wanting to escort his son out of battle,\nfor there are many sons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and\nyou will make every one jealous. If, however, you are fond of him\nand pity him, let him indeed fall by the hand of Patroclus, but as\nsoon as the life is gone out of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to\nbear him off the field and take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where\nhis brothers and his kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar,\nin due honour to the dead.\" \n\nThe sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood upon\nthe earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to kill on\nthe rich plain of Troy far from his home. \n\nWhen they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck Thrasydemus,\nthe brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of the belly, and\nkilled him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus and missed him,\nbut he struck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, and it screamed\naloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life went out of it.\nThe other two horses began to plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked\nand they got entangled in the reins through the fall of the horse\nthat was yoked along with them; but Automedon knew what to do; without\nthe loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that hung by his sturdy\nthigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the other two righted\nthemselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went together into\nbattle. \n\nSarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him,\nthe point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting\nhim. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from\nhis hand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds\nthe ever-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or\ntall pine to which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains\nto make timber for ship-building- even so did he lie stretched at\nfull length in front of his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching\nat the blood-stained dust. As when a lion springs with a bound upon\na herd of cattle and fastens on a great black bull which dies bellowing\nin its clutches- even so did the leader of the Lycian warriors struggle\nin death as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. He called on his trusty\ncomrade and said, \"Glaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth\nall your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit yourself\nlike a valiant soldier. First go about among the Lycian captains and\nbid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do battle to save\nmy armour from being taken. My name will haunt you henceforth and\nfor ever if the Achaeans rob me of my armour now that I have fallen\nat their ships. Do your very utmost and call all my people together.\"\n\nDeath closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on his\nbreast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came out\nalong with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon's soul\nat the same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds,\nwho were wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.\n\nGlaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said,\nfor he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his other\nhand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer's arrow had\ngiven him when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, was assailing\nit. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying, \"Hear me O king\nfrom your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, or may be in Troy,\nfor in all places you can hear the prayer of one who is in distress,\nas I now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain,\nthere is no staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason\nof my hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go among my foes and\nfight them, thou our prince, Jove's son Sarpedon, is slain. Jove defended\nnot his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me of my wound, ease\nmy pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the Lycians and to\nfight along with them round the body of him who has fallen.\"\n\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,\nstaunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.\nGlaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had answered\nhis prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian captains,\nand bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From these\nhe strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthous and Agenor;\nhe then went in search of Aeneas and Hector, and when he had found\nthem he said, \"Hector, you have utterly forgotten your allies, who\nlanguish here for your sake far from friends and home while you do\nnothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycian warriors has\nfallen- he who was at once the right and might of Lycia; Mars has\nlaid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by him, my friends,\nand suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to treat\nhis body with contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom we have\nspeared at the ships.\" \n\nAs he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable grief;\nfor Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the main stays\nof their city, both as having much people with him, and himself the\nforemost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated by the\nfall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans with all their\nmight, while the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son of Menoetius cheered\non the Achaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, men who needed\nno bidding. \"Ajaxes,\" said he, \"may it now please you to show youselves\nthe men you have always been, or even better- Sarpedon is fallen-\nhe who was first to overleap the wall of the Achaeans; let us take\nthe body and outrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders,\nand kill his comrades if they try to rescue his body.\" \n\nHe spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides, therefore,\nthe Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the Myrmidons and Achaeans\non the other, strengthened their battalions, and fought desperately\nabout the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely the while. Mighty was\nthe din of their armour as they came together, and Jove shed a thick\ndarkness over the fight, to increase the of the battle over the body\nof his son. \n\nAt first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for one\nof the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of noble\nAgacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; but\npresently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took refuge\nwith Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noble steeds\nto fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him on the\nhead with a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, and his\nbrains inside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell face\nforemost upon the body of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was\nenraged by the death of his comrade, and sped through the front ranks\nas swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings.\nEven so swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, did you make straight for\nthe Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith he struck\nSthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and broke\nthe tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this Hector and\nthe front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man can throw a\njavelin when competing for some prize, or even in battle- so far did\nthe Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans. Glaucus, captain of the\nLycians, was the first to rally them, by killing Bathycles son of\nChalcon who lived in Hellas and was the richest man among the Myrmidons.\nGlaucus turned round suddenly, just as Bathycles who was pursuing\nhim was about to lay hold of him, and drove his spear right into the\nmiddle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and the\nfall of so good a man filled the Achaeans with dismay, while the Trojans\nwere exultant, and came up in a body round the corpse. Nevertheless\nthe Achaeans, mindful of their prowess, bore straight down upon them.\n\nMeriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus son\nof Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured by\nthe people as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under the\njaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the darkness of death\nlaid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping\nto hit him under the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw\nit coming and stooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew\npast him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went\non quivering till Mars robbed it of its force. The spear, therefore,\nsped from Aeneas's hand in vain and fell quivering to the ground.\nAeneas was angry and said, \"Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if\nI had hit you my spear would soon have made an end of you.\"\n\nAnd Meriones answered, \"Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will not\nbe able to make an end of every one who comes against you. You are\nonly a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle\nof your shield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you\nmay be, I should soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life\nto Hades of the noble steeds.\" \n\nOn this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, \"Meriones, hero\nthough you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my good\nfriend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; some\nof them must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words for\ncouncil; fight, therefore, and say nothing.\" \n\nHe led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As\nthe sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains-\nand the thud of their axes is heard afar- even such a din now rose\nfrom earth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as\nmen smote each other with their swords and spears pointed at both\nends. A man had need of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so covered\nwas he from head to foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmed\nabout the body, as flies that buzz round the full milk-pails in spring\nwhen they are brimming with milk- even so did they gather round Sarpedon;\nnor did Jove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight,\nbut kept looking at it all the time, for he was settling how best\nto kill Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should be allowed\nto end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and strip\nhim of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet further trouble\nto the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the brave squire\nof Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojans back\ntowards the city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, he\nmade Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and\nfled, bidding the other Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales\nof Jove had turned against him. Neither would the brave Lycians stand\nfirm; they were dismayed when they saw their king lying struck to\nthe heart amid a heap of corpses- for when the son of Saturn made\nthe fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore\nstripped the gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son\nof Menoetius gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Jove lord\nof the storm-cloud said to Apollo, \"Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you,\nand take Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black blood\nfrom off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may wash\nhim in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortal\nraiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two fleet messengers,\nDeath, and Sleep, who will carry him straightway to the rich land\nof Lycia, where his brothers and kinsmen will inter him, and will\nraise both mound and pillar to his memory, in due honour to the dead.\"\n\nThus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father's saying, and came down from\nthe heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he took\nSarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way\noff, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosia\nand clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him to\nthe arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who presently\nset him down in the rich land of Lycia. \n\nMeanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to Automedon,\npursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and foolishness of his\nheart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son of Peleus, he would\nhave, escaped death and have been scatheless; but the counsels of\nJove pass man's understanding; he will put even a brave man to flight\nand snatch victory from his grasp, or again he will set him on to\nfight, as he now did when he put a high spirit into the heart of Patroclus.\n\nWho then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when\nthe gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus, Autonous,\nEcheclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and Melanippus; after\nthese he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes. These he slew, but the\nrest saved themselves by flight. \n\nThe sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands of\nPatroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not Phoebus Apollo\ntaken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to aid the\nTrojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the high wall,\nand thrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield with his\nown immortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god for yet\na fourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said,\n\"Draw back, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city of\nthe Trojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of Achilles who is\na far better man than you are.\" On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew\nto some distance and avoided the anger of Apollo. \n\nMeanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean gates,\nin doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or to call\nthe army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo\ndrew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius,\nwho was Hector's uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of Dymas\nwho lived in Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; in his\nlikeness Jove's son Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, \"Hector, why\nhave you left off fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as much\nbetter a man than you, as I am worse, you should soon rue your slackness.\nDrive straight towards Patroclus, if so be that Apollo may grant you\na triumph over him, and you may rull him.\" \n\nWith this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade\nCebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them,\nand struck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector\nand the Trojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no\nman, but drove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his\nchariot to the ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right\na jagged stone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and\nthrew it, nor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was\nnot in vain, for the stone struck Cebriones, Hector's charioteer,\na bastard son of Priam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone\nhit him on the forehead and drove his brows into his head for the\nbone was smashed, and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He\ndropped dead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there\nwas no more life left in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O knight\nPatroclus, saying, \"Bless my heart, how active he is, and how well\nhe dives. If we had been at sea this fellow would have dived from\nthe ship's side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could\nstomach, even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his\nchariot on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are divers also\namong the Trojans.\" \n\nAs he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it were,\nof a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struck in the\nchest, and his courage is his own bane- even so furiously, O Patroclus,\ndid you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also from his chariot\nto the ground. The pair then fought over the body of Cebriones. As\ntwo lions fight fiercely on some high mountain over the body of a\nstag that they have killed, even so did these two mighty warriors,\nPatroclus son of Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another\nover the corpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let him go when he\nhad once got him by the head, while Patroclus kept fast hold of his\nfeet, and a fierce fight raged between the other Danaans and Trojans.\nAs the east and south wind buffet one another when they beat upon\nsome dense forest on the mountains- there is beech and ash and spreading\ncornel; the to of the trees roar as they beat on one another, and\none can hear the boughs cracking and breaking- even so did the Trojans\nand Achaeans spring upon one another and lay about each other, and\nneither side would give way. Many a pointed spear fell to ground and\nmany a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about the body of Cebriones;\nmany a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought\naround his body, but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust,\nall huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now. \n\nSo long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of either\nside were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he went down\ntowards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved to\nbe beyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out of\nrange of the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the armour\nfrom his shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce intent\nand a terrific shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill nine\nmen; but as he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O Patroclus,\nwas the hour of your end approaching, for Phoebus fought you in fell\nearnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about in the crush,\nfor he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck him from\nbehind on his back and his broad shoulders with the flat of his hand,\nso that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat the helmet from\noff his head, and it rolled rattling off under the horses' feet, where\nits horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust and blood. Never\nindeed had that helmet fared so before, for it had served to protect\nthe head and comely forehead of the godlike hero Achilles. Now, however,\nZeus delivered it over to be worn by Hector. Nevertheless the end\nof Hector also was near. The bronze-shod spear, so great and so strong,\nwas broken in the hand of Patroclus, while his shield that covered\nhim from head to foot fell to the ground as did also the band that\nheld it, and Apollo undid the fastenings of his corslet.\n\nOn this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he stood\nas one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, the best\nspearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner,\ncame behind him and struck him in the back with a spear, midway between\nthe shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had come up with his chariot\nhad dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of\nwar- he it was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove a weapon into\nyou, but he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then ran back into\nthe crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would\nnot stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed though he now was,\nto attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god had\ngiven him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men\nin fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to be wounded and\ngiving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and when close up\nwith him struck him in the lower part of the belly with a spear, driving\nthe bronze point right through it, so that he fell heavily to the\nground to the great of the Achaeans. As when a lion has fought some\nfierce wild-boar and worsted him- the two fight furiously upon the\nmountains over some little fountain at which they would both drink,\nand the lion has beaten the boar till he can hardly breathe- even\nso did Hector son of Priam take the life of the brave son of Menoetius\nwho had killed so many, striking him from close at hand, and vaunting\nover him the while. \"Patroclus,\" said he, \"you deemed that you should\nsack our city, rob our Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them\noff in your ships to your own country. Fool; Hector and his fleet\nhorses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I am foremost\nof all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage from off them;\nas for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles\nwith all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I ween when you\nleft him he charged you straitly saying, 'Come not back to the ships,\nknight Patroclus, till you have rent the bloodstained shirt of murderous\nHector about his body. Thus I ween did he charge you, and your fool's\nheart answered him 'yea' within you.\" \n\nThen, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight Patroclus:\n\"Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn and Apollo\nhave vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished me so\neasily, and they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders; had\ntwenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen\nbefore my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and\namong mortal men Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in the killing\nof me. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, you too shall\nlive but for a little season; death and the day of your doom are close\nupon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles son of\nAeacus.\" \n\nWhen he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul left\nhis body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad\nfate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead\nthough he was, Hector still spoke to him saying, \"Patroclus, why should\nyou thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis,\nmay be smitten by my spear and die before me?\" \n\nAs he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his\nfoot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He\nthen went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet descendant\nof Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which\nthe gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him swiftly from\nthe field. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XVII\n\nBrave Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had\nfallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armour\nto bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even\nso did yellow-haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his round\nshield and his spear in front of him, resolute to kill any who should\ndare face him. But the son of Panthous had also noted the body, and\ncame up to Menelaus saying, \"Menelaus, son of Atreus, draw back, leave\nthe body, and let the bloodstained spoils be. I was first of the Trojans\nand their brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, let me, therefore,\nhave my full glory among the Trojans, or I will take aim and kill\nyou.\" \n\nTo this Menelaus answered in great anger \"By father Jove, boasting\nis an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savage\nwild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures,\nthan are the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out\nthe days of his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming\nme the meanest soldier among the Danaans. His own feet never bore\nhim back to gladden his wife and parents. Even so shall I make an\nend of you too, if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and\ndo not face me, or it shall be worse for you. Even a fool may be wise\nafter the event.\" \n\nEuphorbus would not listen, and said, \"Now indeed, Menelaus, shall\nyou pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whose\nwife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought grief unspeakable\non his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if I bring your\nhead and armour and place them in the hands of Panthous and noble\nPhrontis. The time is come when this matter shall be fought out and\nsettled, for me or against me.\" \n\nAs he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear did\nnot go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus then took\naim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawing back,\nand Menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaning his\nwhole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point went\nclean through his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him as\nhe fell heavily to the ground. His hair which was like that of the\nGraces, and his locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold,\nwere all bedrabbled with blood. As one who has grown a fine young\nolive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water- the\nplant is full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from every\nquarter it puts forth its white blossoms till the blasts of some fierce\nhurricane sweep down upon it and level it with the ground- even so\ndid Menelaus strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour after he\nhad slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride\nof his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is feeding-\nfirst he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then gorges on\nher blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry against\nhim, but they stand aloof and will not come close to him, for they\nare pale with fear- even so no one had the courage to face valiant\nMenelaus. The son of Atreus would have then carried off the armour\nof the son of Panthous with ease, had not Phoebus Apollo been angry,\nand in the guise of Mentes chief of the Cicons incited Hector to attack\nhim. \"Hector,\" said he, \"you are now going after the horses of the\nnoble son of Aeacus, but you will not take them; they cannot be kept\nin hand and driven by mortal man, save only by Achilles, who is son\nto an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus son of Atreus has bestridden\nthe body of Patroclus and killed the noblest of the Trojans, Euphorbus\nson of Panthous, so that he can fight no more.\" \n\nThe god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of\nHector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranks\nand saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowing\nfrom his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour. On this\nhe made his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming\narmour, and crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heard\nhim, he said to himself in his dismay, \"Alas! what shall I do? I may\nnot let the Trojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallen fighting\non my behalf, lest some Danaan who sees me should cry shame upon me.\nStill if for my honour's sake I fight Hector and the Trojans single-handed,\nthey will prove too many for me, for Hector is bringing them up in\nforce. Why, however, should I thus hesitate? When a man fights in\ndespite of heaven with one whom a god befriends, he will soon rue\nit. Let no Danaan think ill of me if I give place to Hector, for the\nhand of heaven is with him. Yet, if I could find Ajax, the two of\nus would fight Hector and heaven too, if we might only save the body\nof Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus. This, of many evils would\nbe the least.\" \n\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with Hector\nat their head; he therefore drew back and left the body, turning about\nlike some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and men from a\nstockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he is daunted and slinks\nsulkily off- even so did Menelaus son of Atreus turn and leave the\nbody of Patroclus. When among the body of his men, he looked around\nfor mighty Ajax son of Telamon, and presently saw him on the extreme\nleft of the fight, cheering on his men and exhorting them to keep\non fighting, for Phoebus Apollo had spread a great panic among them.\nHe ran up to him and said, \"Ajax, my good friend, come with me at\nonce to dead Patroclus, if so be that we may take the body to Achilles-\nas for his armour, Hector already has it.\" \n\nThese words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among the\nfront ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped Patroclus\nof his armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take\nthe body to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with his\nshield like wall before him, on which Hector withdrew under shelter\nof his men, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to\nthe Trojans to take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; Ajax,\ntherefore, covered the body of Patroclus with his broad shield and\nbestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if hunters have come\nupon him in a forest when he is with his little ones- in the pride\nand fierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they\ncover his eyes- even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, and\nby his side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow in\nhis heart. \n\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and rebuked\nhim sternly. \"Hector,\" said he, \"you make a brave show, but in fight\nyou are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim to so\ngreat a reputation. Think how you may now save your town and citadel\nby the hands of your own people born in Ilius; for you will get no\nLycians to fight for you, seeing what thanks they have had for their\nincessant hardships. Are you likely, sir, to do anything to help a\nman of less note, after leaving Sarpedon, who was at once your guest\nand comrade in arms, to be the spoil and prey of the Danaans? So long\nas he lived he did good service both to your city and yourself; yet\nyou had no stomach to save his body from the dogs. If the Lycians\nwill listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to its fate. If\nthe Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays hold\nof men who are fighting for their country and harassing those who\nwould attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into Ilius. Could\nwe get this dead man away and bring him into the city of Priam, the\nArgives would readily give up the armour of Sarpedon, and we should\nget his body to boot. For he whose squire has been now killed is the\nforemost man at the ships of the Achaeans- he and his close-fighting\nfollowers. Nevertheless you dared not make a stand against Ajax, nor\nface him, eye to eye, with battle all round you, for he is a braver\nman than you are.\" \n\nHector scowled at him and answered, \"Glaucus, you should know better.\nI have held you so far as a man of more understanding than any in\nall Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid of Ajax.\nI fear neither battle nor the din of chariots, but Jove's will is\nstronger than ours; Jove at one time makes even a strong man draw\nback and snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will\nset him on to fight. Come hither then, my friend, stand by me and\nsee indeed whether I shall play the coward the whole day through as\nyou say, or whether I shall not stay some even of the boldest Danaans\nfrom fighting round the body of Patroclus.\" \n\nAs he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, \"Trojans, Lycians,\nand Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends, and\nfight might and main, while I put on the goodly armour of Achilles,\nwhich I took when I killed Patroclus.\" \n\nWith this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men\nwho were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet got\nfar. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed\nhis armour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius and to the\nTrojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus,\nwhich the gods had given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his\nson; but the son did not grow old in his father's armour.\n\nWhen Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and\narming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged his head\nand muttered to himself saying, \"A! poor wretch, you arm in the armour\nof a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you reck nothing\nof the doom that is already close upon you. You have killed his comrade\nso brave and strong, but it was not well that you should strip the\narmour from his head and shoulders. I do indeed endow you with great\nmight now, but as against this you shall not return from battle to\nlay the armour of the son of Peleus before Andromache.\" \n\nThe son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted the\narmour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, and filled\nhis whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode in among\nthe allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemed to\nall of them like the great son of Peleus himself. He went about among\nthem and cheered them on- Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, Thersilochus,\nAsteropaeus, Deisenor and Hippothous, Phorcys, Chromius and Ennomus\nthe augur. All these did he exhort saying, \"Hear me, allies from other\ncities who are here in your thousands, it was not in order to have\na crowd about me that I called you hither each from his several city,\nbut that with heart and soul you might defend the wives and little\nones of the Trojans from the fierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress\nmy people with your food and the presents that make you rich. Therefore\nturn, and charge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the game of war;\nwhoever shall bring Patroclus, dead though he be, into the hands of\nthe Trojans, and shall make Ajax give way before him, I will give\nhim one half of the spoils while I keep the other. He will thus share\nlike honour with myself.\" \n\nWhen he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans\nwith their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran\nhigh that he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body-\nfools that they were, for he was about to take the lives of many.\nThen Ajax said to Menelaus, \"My good friend Menelaus, you and I shall\nhardly come out of this fight alive. I am less concerned for the body\nof Patroclus, who will shortly become meat for the dogs and vultures\nof Troy, than for the safety of my own head and yours. Hector has\nwrapped us round in a storm of battle from every quarter, and our\ndestruction seems now certain. Call then upon the princes of the Danaans\nif there is any who can hear us.\" \n\nMenelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at the\ntop of his voice. \"My friends,\" he cried, \"princes and counsellors\nof the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at the\npublic cost, and give orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafes\nhim power and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I cannot\ndistinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden,\nand think it shame that Patroclus should become meat and morsel for\nTrojan hounds.\" \n\nFleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way\nthrough the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and Meriones\nhis esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others that came into\nthe fight after these, who of his own self could name them?\n\nThe Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a great\nwave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-born river,\nand the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of the breakers\nthat beat and buffet them- even with such a roar did the Trojans come\non; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm about the son\nof Menoetius, and fenced him with their bronze shields. Jove, moreover,\nhid the brightness of their helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borne\nno grudge against the son of Menoetius while he was still alive and\nsquire to the descendant of Aeacus; therefore he was loth to let him\nfall a prey to the dogs of his foes the Trojans, and urged his comrades\non to defend him. \n\nAt first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew from\nthe dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing any one,\nnevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not lose\nit long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus\nalike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and made towards\nthe front like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands at bay\nin the forest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths that have\nattacked him- even so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in among\nthe phalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who had bestridden Patroclus\nand were most bent on winning glory by dragging him off to their city.\nAt this moment Hippothous brave son of the Pelasgian Lethus, in his\nzeal for Hector and the Trojans, was dragging the body off by the\nfoot through the press of the fight, having bound a strap round the\nsinews near the ancle; but a mischief soon befell him from which none\nof those could save him who would have gladly done so, for the son\nof Telamon sprang forward and smote him on his bronze-cheeked helmet.\nThe plumed headpiece broke about the point of the weapon, struck at\nonce by the spear and by the strong hand of Ajax, so that the bloody\nbrain came oozing out through the crest-socket. His strength then\nfailed him and he let Patroclus' foot drop from his hand, as he fell\nfull length dead upon the body; thus he died far from the fertile\nland of Larissa, and never repaid his parents the cost of bringing\nhim up, for his life was cut short early by the spear of mighty Ajax.\nHector then took aim at Ajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and\njust managed to avoid it; the spear passed on and struck Schedius\nson of noble Iphitus, captain of the Phoceans, who dwelt in famed\nPanopeus and reigned over much people; it struck him under the middle\nof the collar-bone the bronze point went right through him, coming\nout at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and his armour rang rattling\nround him as he fell heavily to the ground. Ajax in his turn struck\nnoble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the middle of the belly as he was\nbestriding Hippothous, and broke the plate of his cuirass; whereon\nthe spear tore out his entrails and he clutched the ground in his\npalm as he fell to earth. Hector and those who were in the front rank\nthen gave ground, while the Argives raised a loud cry of triumph,\nand drew off the bodies of Phorcys and Hippothous which they stripped\npresently of their armour. \n\nThe Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and\ndriven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the Argives,\nso great was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a triumph\neven against the will of Jove, if Apollo had not roused Aeneas, in\nthe likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant who had grown\nold in the service of Aeneas' aged father, and was at all times devoted\nto him. In his likeness, then, Apollo said, \"Aeneas, can you not manage,\neven though heaven be against us, to save high Ilius? I have known\nmen, whose numbers, courage, and self-reliance have saved their people\nin spite of Jove, whereas in this case he would much rather give victory\nto us than to the Danaans, if you would only fight instead of being\nso terribly afraid.\" \n\nAeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to\nHector saying, \"Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on\nus if we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius through\nour own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me that Jove\nthe supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make for the\nDanaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away dead Patroclus\nto the ships.\" \n\nAs he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then rallied\nand again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus son of Arisbas,\na valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved with pity\nas he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared Apisaon\nson of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under the midriff,\nso that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was the best\nman of them all after Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forward to avenge\nhim and attack the Danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch\nas those about Patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held\ntheir spears in front of them, for Ajax had given them strict orders\nthat no man was either to give ground, or to stand out before the\nothers, but all were to hold well together about the body and fight\nhand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth ran red with\nblood as the corpses fell thick on one another alike on the side of\nthe Trojans and allies, and on that of the Danaans; for these last,\ntoo, fought no bloodless fight though many fewer of them perished,\nthrough the care they took to defend and stand by one another.\n\nThus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though\nit had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden\nover all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the\ndead son of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought\nat their ease in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them,\nand there was not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain.\nThese last moreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting,\nfor they were some distance apart and beyond the range of one another's\nweapons, whereas those who were in the thick of the fray suffered\nboth from battle and darkness. All the best of them were being worn\nout by the great weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes,\nThrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of Patroclus,\nand believed him to be still alive and leading the van against the\nTrojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve against the death\nor rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered when he sent\nthem from the ships into battle. \n\nThus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the sweat\nof their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on their hands\nand eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son of Peleus.\nIt was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat to\nhis men, and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in\na ring and tug till the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for\nthe many that pull at it, and it is well stretched- even so did the\ntwo sides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass\nof but a little space- the Trojans steadfastly set on drag ing it\ninto Ilius, while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their\nships; and fierce was the fight between them. Not Mars himself the\nlord of hosts, nor yet Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make\nlight of such a battle. \n\nSuch fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordain\nround the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not know that\nhe had fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way\noff the ships. He had no idea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead,\nand deemed that he would return alive as soon as he had gone close\nup to the gates. He knew that he was not to sack the city neither\nwith nor without himself, for his mother had often told him this when\nhe had sat alone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels\nof great Jove. Now, however, she had not told him how great a disaster\nhad befallen him in the death of the one who was far dearest to him\nof all his comrades. \n\nThe others still kept on charging one another round the body with\ntheir pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say, \"My\nfriends, we can never again show our faces at the ships- better, and\ngreatly better, that earth should open and swallow us here in this\nplace, than that we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearing\noff Patroclus to their city.\" \n\nThe Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying, \"Friends,\nthough we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrink from fighting.\"\nWith such words did they exhort each other. They fought and fought,\nand an iron clank rose through the void air to the brazen vault of\nheaven. The horses of the descendant of Aeacus stood out of the fight\nand wept when they heard that their driver had been laid low by the\nhand of murderous Hector. Automedon, valiant son of Diores, lashed\nthem again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and\nmany a time did he upbraid them, but they would neither go back to\nthe ships by the waters of the broad Hellespont, nor yet into battle\namong the Achaeans; they stood with their chariot stock still, as\na pillar set over the tomb of some dead man or woman, and bowed their\nheads to the ground. Hot tears fell from their eyes as they mourned\nthe loss of their charioteer, and their noble manes drooped all wet\nfrom under the yokestraps on either side the yoke. \n\nThe son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He wagged\nhis head, and muttered to himself, saying, \"Poor things, why did we\ngive you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are yourselves\nageless and immortal? Was it that you might share the sorrows that\nbefall mankind? for of all creatures that live and move upon the earth\nthere is none so pitiable as he is- still, Hector son of Priam shall\ndrive neither you nor your chariot. I will not have it. It is enough\nthat he should have the armour over which he vaunts so vainly. Furthermore\nI will give you strength of heart and limb to bear Automedon safely\nto the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojans triumph still\nfurther, and go on killing till they reach the ships; whereon night\nshall fall and darkness overshadow the land.\" \n\nAs he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so that\nthey shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariot\nswiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behind\nthem fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture\namid a flock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed\nhe dashed amid the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of\nhis pursuit he killed no man, for he could not wield his spear and\nkeep his horses in hand when alone in the chariot; at last, however,\na comrade, Alcimedon, son of Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of\nhim and came up behind his chariot. \"Automedon,\" said he, \"what god\nhas put this folly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind,\nthat you fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed? He who\nwas your comrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed\nin the armour of the descendant of Aeacus.\" \n\nAutomedon son of Diores answered, \"Alcimedon, there is no one else\nwho can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can,\nsave only Patroclus- while he was alive- peer of gods in counsel.\nTake then the whip and reins, while I go down from the car and fight.\n\nAlcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and reins,\nwhile Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw him he said\nto Aeneas who was near him, \"Aeneas, counsellor of the mail-clad Trojans,\nI see the steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus come into battle with\nweak hands to drive them. I am sure, if you think well, that we might\ntake them; they will not dare face us if we both attack them.\"\n\nThe valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair went\nright on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dry\nox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also\nwith them, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill\nthe men and capture the horses- fools that they were, for they were\nnot to return scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed\nto father Jove and was forthwith filled with courage and strength\nabounding. He turned to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said, \"Alcimedon,\nkeep your horses so close up that I may feel their breath upon my\nback; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son of Priam till he has\nkilled us and mounted behind the horses; he will then either spread\npanic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himself be killed among\nthe foremost.\" \n\nOn this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, \"Ajaxes captains\nof the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to them that\nare best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us living; for\nHector and Aeneas who are the two best men among the Trojans, are\npressing us hard in the full tide of war. Nevertheless the issue lies\non the lap of heaven, I will therefore hurl my spear and leave the\nrest to Jove.\" \n\nHe poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the round\nshield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed\nit not, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part\nof his belly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow\nbehind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its\nneck so that it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus\ngive one bound and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his\nbody till it made an end of him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon\nbut he saw it coming and stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew\npast him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went\non quivering till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then have\nfought hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced their\nway through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and parted\nthem for all their fury- for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius were afraid\nand drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to the heart. Automedon,\npeer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of his armour and vaunted over\nhim saying, \"I have done little to assuage my sorrow for the son of\nMenoetius, for the man I have killed is not so good as he was.\"\n\nAs he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon his\nchariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all steeped\nin gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull. \n\nAnd now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, for\nMinerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command of\nfar-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encourage\nthe Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token\nto mankind either of war or of the chill storms that stay men from\ntheir labour and plague the flocks- even so, wrapped in such radiant\nraiment, did Minerva go in among the host and speak man by man to\neach. First she took the form and voice of Phoenix and spoke to Menelaus\nson of Atreus, who was standing near her. \"Menelaus,\" said she, \"it\nwill be shame and dishonour to you, if dogs tear the noble comrade\nof Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and urge\nyour men to be so also.\" \n\nMenelaus answered, \"Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva vouchsafe\nme strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall I stand by\nPatroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, but Hector\nis as a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, for Jove\nis now granting him a time of triumph.\" \n\nMinerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the\nother gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders,\nand made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet come\nagain and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man's blood- even\nso bold as this did she make him as he stood over Patroclus and threw\nhis spear. Now there was among the Trojans a man named Podes, son\nof Eetion, who was both rich and valiant. Hector held him in the highest\nhonour for he was his comrade and boon companion; the spear of Menelaus\nstruck this man in the girdle just as he had turned in flight, and\nwent right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward, and Menelaus\nson of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of\nhis own people. \n\nApollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the\nlikeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the\nmost favoured of all Hector's guests. In his likeness Apollo said,\n\"Hector, who of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you\nhave quailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier?\nYet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, and\nhas slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podes\nson of Eetion. \n\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made his\nway to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of Saturn seized\nhis bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sent forth\nhis lightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis he gave\nvictory to the Trojans and routed the Achaeans. \n\nThe panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping his\nface turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear on the\nupper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazed\nthe top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck him\nfrom close at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitus son\nof noble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from\nfighting further. He looked about him in dismay, knowing that never\nagain should he wield spear in battle with the Trojans. While Hector\nwas in pursuit of Leitus, Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate\nover his chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft,\nand the Trojans cheered aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son\nof Deucalion as he was standing on his chariot, and very narrowly\nmissed him, but the spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer\nof Meriones who had come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left\nthe ships on foot and would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans\nif Coiranus had not driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought\nlife and rescue to Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of murderous\nHector. For Hector hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the\nspear drove out his teeth and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that\nhe fell from his chariot and let the reins fall to the ground. Meriones\ngathered them up from the ground and took them into his own hands,\nthen he said to Idomeneus, \"Lay on, till you get back to the ships,\nfor you must see that the day is no longer ours.\" \n\nOn this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had taken\nhold upon him. \n\nAjax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour of\nthe Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. \"Alas,\" said he, \"even a\nfool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All their weapons\nstrike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or a coward that\nhurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one of them\nwithout effect. What, then, will be best both as regards rescuing\nthe body, and our return to the joy of our friends who will be grieving\nas they look hitherwards; for they will make sure that nothing can\nnow check the terrible hands of Hector, and that he will fling himself\nupon our ships. I wish that some one would go and tell the son of\nPeleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heard the sad news\nthat the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I can see not a man\namong the Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike\nhidden in darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from over the sons\nof the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you will that\nwe perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.\" \n\nFather Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwith\nhe chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out and\nall the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, \"Look,\nMenelaus, and if Antilochus son of Nestor be still living, send him\nat once to tell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his\ncomrades has fallen.\" \n\nMenelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a stockyard-\nthe lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keep watch\nthe whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat of their\nherd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain, for\ndarts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunt\nhim for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away-\neven so did Menelaus sorely against his will leave Patroclus, in great\nfear lest the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fall\ninto the hands of the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes\nstraitly saying, \"Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, now\nindeed remember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous while\nalive, bear it in mind now that he is dead.\" \n\nWith this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an eagle,\nwhose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird- however\nhigh he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape him\nby crouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it\nand make an end of it- even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes range\nround the mighty host of your followers to see if you could find the\nson of Nestor still alive. Presently Menelaus saw him on the extreme\nleft of the battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fight\nboldly. Menelaus went up to him and said, \"Antilochus, come here and\nlisten to sad news, which I would indeed were untrue. You must see\nwith your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans,\nand giving victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was the\nbravest of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Run\ninstantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescue\nthe body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector already\nhas it.\" \n\nAntilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was speechless;\nhis eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance, but he\ndid as Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he had given\nhis armour to a comrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horses round,\nclose beside him. \n\nThus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad news\nto Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded to succour\nhis harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians- and greatly\ndid they miss him- but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and himself\nwent back to Patroclus. He came running up to the two Ajaxes and said,\n\"I have sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, but rage against\nHector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight without armour.\nWhat then will be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead,\nand our own escape from death amid the battle-cries of the Trojans?\"\n\nAjax answered, \"Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and Meriones\nstoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray, while we\ntwo behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in heart as in\nname, and long used to fighting side by side with one another.\"\n\nOn this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and\nlifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised\na hue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the body\naway, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at\nthe loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at\nhim as though they would tear him in pieces, but now and again he\nturns on them in a fury, scaring and scattering them in all directions-\neven so did the Trojans for a while charge in a body, striking with\nsword and with spears pointed ai both the ends, but when the two Ajaxes\nfaced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no man dared\npress on to fight further about the dead. \n\nIn this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the body\nto the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them like fierce\nflames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city, and\nthe houses fall in the glare of its burning- even such was the roar\nand tramp of men and horses that pursued them as they bore Patroclus\nfrom the field. Or as mules that put forth all their strength to draw\nsome beam or great piece of ship's timber down a rough mountain-track,\nand they pant and sweat as they, go even so did Menelaus and pant\nand sweat as they bore the body of Patroclus. Behind them the two\nAjaxes held stoutly out. As some wooded mountain-spur that stretches\nacross a plain will turn water and check the flow even of a great\nriver, nor is there any stream strong enough to break through it-\neven so did the two Ajaxes face the Trojans and stern the tide of\ntheir fighting though they kept pouring on towards them and foremost\namong them all was Aeneas son of Anchises with valiant Hector. As\na flock of daws or starlings fall to screaming and chattering when\nthey see a falcon, foe to i'll small birds, come soaring near them,\neven so did the Achaean youth raise a babel of cries as they fled\nbefore Aeneas and Hector, unmindful of their former prowess. In the\nrout of the Danaans much goodly armour fell round about the trench,\nand of fighting there was no end. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XVIII\n\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the\nfleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached Achilles,\nand found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that which was\nindeed too surely true. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness\nof his heart, \"why are the Achaeans again scouring the plain and flocking\ntowards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not now bringing that\nsorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, saying that while\nI was yet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fall before the\nTrojans, and see the light of the sun no longer. I fear the brave\nson of Menoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet I bade\nhim return to the ships as soon as he had driven back those that were\nbringing fire against them, and not join battle with Hector.\"\n\nAs he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and told\nhis sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. \"Alas,\" he cried, \"son of\nnoble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that they were\nuntrue. Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about his naked\nbody- for Hector holds his armour.\" \n\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filled\nboth hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,\ndisfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over his\nshirt so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely at\nfull length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom\nAchilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,\nbeating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.\nAntilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his hands\nas he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into\nhis own throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard\nhim as she was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her\nfather, whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus\nthat dwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There\nwere Glauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, thoe and dark-eyed\nHalie, Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe and\nAgave, Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and\nCallianeira, Doris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes,\nApseudes and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeira and Ianassa,\nMaera, Oreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids\nwho dwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was filled with\ntheir multitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them\nin their lament. \n\n\"Listen,\" she cried, \"sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may hear\nthe burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I have borne\nthe most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, hero among\nheroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plant in a\ngoodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans,\nbut never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long\nas he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is in heaviness,\nand though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I will go,\nthat I may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallen him\nthough he is still holding aloof from battle.\" \n\nShe left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping\nafter, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached\nthe rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line\non to the sands, at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons were\ndrawn up in close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother went\nup to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and\nspoke piteously, saying, \"My son, why are you thus weeping? What sorrow\nhas now befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jove has\ngranted you the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands\nand besought him that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up at\ntheir ships, and rue it bitterly in that you were no longer with them.\"\n\nAchilles groaned and answered, \"Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed vouchsafed\nme the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me, seeing that\nmy dear comrade Patroclus has fallen- he whom I valued more than all\nothers, and loved as dearly as my own life? I have lost him; aye,\nand Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrous armour, so\nglorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when they laid you\nin the couch of a mortal man. Would that you were still dwelling among\nthe immortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken to himself some\nmortal bride. For now you shall have grief infinite by reason of the\ndeath of that son whom you can never welcome home- nay, I will not\nlive nor go about among mankind unless Hector fall by my spear, and\nthus pay me for having slain Patroclus son of Menoetius.\"\n\nThetis wept and answered, \"Then, my son, is your end near at hand-\nfor your own death awaits you full soon after that of Hector.\"\n\nThen said Achilles in his great grief, \"I would die here and now,\nin that I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home,\nand in his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is\nthere for me? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought\nno saving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so\nmany have been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootless\nburden upon the earth, I, who in fight have no peer among the Achaeans,\nthough in council there are better than I. Therefore, perish strife\nboth from among gods and men, and anger, wherein even a righteous\nman will harden his heart- which rises up in the soul of a man like\nsmoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey. Even\nso has Agamemnon angered me. And yet- so be it, for it is over; I\nwill force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will\npursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will then\nabide my doom when it may please Jove and the other gods to send it.\nEven Hercules, the best beloved of Jove- even he could not escape\nthe hand of death, but fate and Juno's fierce anger laid him low,\nas I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom awaits me. Till then\nI will win fame, and will bid Trojan and Dardanian women wring tears\nfrom their tender cheeks with both their hands in the grievousness\nof their great sorrow; thus shall they know that he who has held aloof\nso long will hold aloof no longer. Hold me not back, therefore, in\nthe love you bear me, for you shall not move me.\" \n\nThen silver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, what you have said is\ntrue. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but your\narmour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph\nupon his own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not\nbe lasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the\npress of battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break\nof day I shall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from King\nVulcan.\" \n\nOn this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to\nthe sea-nymphs her sisters, \"Dive into the bosom of the sea and go\nto the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as\nfor me, I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and\nask him to provide my son with a suit of splendid armour.\"\n\nWhen she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves, while\nsilver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the armour\nfor her son. \n\nThus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and meanwhile\nthe Achaeans were flying with loud cries before murderous Hector till\nthey reached the ships and the Hellespont, and they could not draw\nthe body of Mars's servant Patroclus out of reach of the weapons that\nwere showered upon him, for Hector son of Priam with his host and\nhorsemen had again caught up to him like the flame of a fiery furnace;\nthrice did brave Hector seize him by the feet, striving with might\nand main to draw him away and calling loudly on the Trojans, and thrice\ndid the two Ajaxes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him\nfrom off the body; but all undaunted he would now charge into the\nthick of the fight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud,\nbut he would give no ground. As upland shepherds that cannot chase\nsome famished lion from a carcase, even so could not the two Ajaxes\nscare Hector son of Priam from the body of Patroclus. \n\nAnd now he would even have dragged it off and have won imperishable\nglory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her way as messenger\nfrom Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. She came secretly\nwithout the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, for Juno sent\nher, and when she had got close to him she said, \"Up, son of Peleus,\nmightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom this fearful\nfight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another, the\nDanaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans are trying\nto hale it away, and take it to wind Ilius: Hector is the most furious\nof them all; he is for cutting the head from the body and fixing it\non the stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink\nfrom the thought that Patroclus may become meat for the dogs of Troy.\nShame on you, should his body suffer any kind of outrage.\"\n\nAnd Achilles said, \"Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you to\nme?\" \n\nIris answered, \"It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son\nof Saturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of the\nimmortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus.\" \n\nThen fleet Achilles answered her saying, \"How can I go up into the\nbattle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I should\nsee her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from Vulcan;\nI know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of Ajax\nson of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front rank and\nwielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus.\" \n\nIris said, 'We know that your armour has been taken, but go as you\nare; go to the deep trench and show yourelf before the Trojans, that\nthey may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons\nof the Achaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle may\nhardly be.\" \n\nIris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove arose,\nand Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong shoulders;\nshe crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which she kindled\na glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into heaven from\nsome city that is being beleaguered on an island far out at sea- all\nday long do men sally from the city and fight their hardest, and at\nthe going down of the sun the line of beacon-fires blazes forth, flaring\nhigh for those that dwell near them to behold, if so be that they\nmay come with their ships and succour them- even so did the light\nflare from the head of Achilles, as he stood by the trench, going\nbeyond the wall- but he aid not join the Achaeans for he heeded the\ncharge which his mother laid upon him. \n\nThere did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice\nfrom afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing\nas the note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the\ngates of a city, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus,\nand when the Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the\nhorses turned back with their chariots for they boded mischief, and\ntheir drivers were awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyed\ngoddess had kindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.\n\nThrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,\nand thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into confusion;\nwhereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath the wheels\nof their chariots and perished by their own spears. The Achaeans to\ntheir great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of the weapons, and\nlaid him on a litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, and among\nthem fleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying\ndead upon his bier. He had sent him out with horses and chariots into\nbattle, but his return he was not to welcome. \n\nThen Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters of\nOceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and turmoil\nof war. \n\nNow the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked their\nhorses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. They\nkept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallen\nupon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having held\naloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first to\nspeak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both before\nand after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon the\nsame night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed\nthem thus:- \n\n\"Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to your\ncity and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are far from\nour walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnon the Achaeans\nwere easier to deal with, and I would have gladly camped by the ships\nin the hope of taking them; but now I go in great fear of the fleet\nson of Peleus; he is so daring that he will never bide here on the\nplain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fight with equal valour, but\nhe will try to storm our city and carry off our women. Do then as\nI say, and let us retreat. For this is what will happen. The darkness\nof night will for a time stay the son of Peleus, but if he find us\nhere in the morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall\nhave knowledge of him in good earnest. Glad indeed will he be who\ncan escape and get back to Ilius, and many a Trojan will become meat\nfor dogs and vultures may I never live to hear it. If we do as I say,\nlittle though we may like it, we shall have strength in counsel during\nthe night, and the great gates with the doors that close them will\nprotect the city. At dawn we can arm and take our stand on the walls;\nhe will then rue it if he sallies from the ships to fight us. He will\ngo back when he has given his horses their fill of being driven all\nwhithers under our walls, and will be in no mind to try and force\nhis way into the city. Neither will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour\nhim ere he do so.\" \n\nHector looked fiercely at him and answered, \"Polydamas, your words\nare not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within\nthe city. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls?\nIn the old-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over\nfor its wealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out\nof our houses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair\nMeonia, for the hand of Jove has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,\nthat the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here\nand to hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this fool's\nwise among the people. You will have no man with you; it shall not\nbe; do all of you as I now say;- take your suppers in your companies\nthroughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful every man\nof you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let him gather\nthem and give them out among the people. Better let these, rather\nthan the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm and fight about\nthe ships; granted that Achilles has again come forward to defend\nthem, let it be as he will, but it shall go hard with him. I shall\nnot shun him, but will fight him, to fall or conquer. The god of war\ndeals out like measure to all, and the slayer may yet be slain.\"\n\nThus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted\nin applause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding.\nThey gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words\nof Polydamas no man would heed. They took their supper throughout\nthe host, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mourned\nPatroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid\nhis murderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again\nand again as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed\nhim of his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he\nis furious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he\ncan find him, for he is mad with rage- even so with many a sigh did\nAchilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, \"Alas! vain were the words\nwith which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said that\nI would bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked\nIlius and taken his share of the spoils- but Jove does not give all\nmen their heart's desire. The same soil shall be reddened here at\nTroy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomed home\nby the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in this\nplace shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, now that\nI am left behind you, I will not bury you, till I have brought hither\nthe head and armour of mighty Hector who has slain you. Twelve noble\nsons of Trojans will I behead before your bier to avenge you; till\nI have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships, and fair women\nof Troy and Dardanus, whom we have taken with spear and strength of\narm when we sacked men's goodly cities, shall weep over you both night\nand day.\" \n\nThen Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire that\nthey might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon they\nset a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw sticks\non to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played\nabout the belly of the tripod. When the water in the cauldron was\nboiling they washed the body, anointed it with oil, and closed its\nwounds with ointment that had been kept nine years. Then they laid\nit on a bier and covered it with a linen cloth from head to foot,\nand over this they laid a fair white robe. Thus all night long did\nthe Myrmidons gather round Achilles to mourn Patroclus. \n\nThen Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, \"So, Queen Juno, you have\ngained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think that\nthe Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.\" \n\nAnd Juno answered, \"Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this thing?\nMay not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we do,\ndo what he can for another person? And shall not I- foremost of all\ngoddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign in heaven-\ndevise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?\" \n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of Vulcan,\nimperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in heaven, a\nhouse of bronze wrought by the lame god's own hands. She found him\nbusy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making\ntwenty tripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, and he\nset wheels of gold under them all that they might go of their own\nselves to the assemblies of the gods, and come back again- marvels\nindeed to see. They were finished all but the ears of cunning workmanship\nwhich yet remained to be fixed to them: these he was now fixing, and\nhe was hammering at the rivets. While he was thus at work silver-footed\nThetis came to the house. Charis, of graceful head-dress, wife to\nthe far-famed lame god, came towards her as soon as she saw her, and\ntook her hand in her own, saying, \"Why have you come to our house,\nThetis, honoured and ever welcome- for you do not visit us often?\nCome inside and let me set refreshment before you.\" \n\nThe goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a richly\ndecorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under\nher feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, \"Vulcan, come here, Thetis\nwants you\"; and the far-famed lame god answered, \"Then it is indeed\nan august and honoured goddess who has come here; she it was that\ntook care of me when I was suffering from the heavy fall which I had\nthrough my cruel mother's anger- for she would have got rid of me\nbecause I was lame. It would have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome,\ndaughter of the ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, and Thetis, taken\nme to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them, and many beautiful\nworks in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups, and chains, did I\nmake for them in their cave, with the roaring waters of Oceanus foaming\nas they rushed ever past it; and no one knew, neither of gods nor\nmen, save only Thetis and Eurynome who took care of me. If, then,\nThetis has come to my house I must make her due requital for having\nsaved me; entertain her, therefore, with all hospitality, while I\nput by my bellows and all my tools.\" \n\nOn this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legs\nplying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, and\ngathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge and\nwashed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donned\nhis shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door.\nThere were golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like\nreal young women, with sense and reason, voice also and strength,\nand all the learning of the immortals; these busied themselves as\nthe king bade them, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon\na goodly seat, and took her hand in his own, saying, \"Why have you\ncome to our house, Thetis honoured and ever welcome- for you do not\nvisit us often? Say what you want, and I will do it for you at once\nif I can, and if it can be done at all.\" \n\nThetis wept and answered, \"Vulcan, is there another goddess in Olympus\nwhom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so much affliction\nas he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did he make subject\nto a mortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorely against my will\ndid I submit to the embraces of one who was but mortal, and who now\nstays at home worn out with age. Neither is this all. Heaven vouchsafed\nme a son, hero among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling. I tended\nhim as a plant in a goodly garden and sent him with his ships to Ilius\nto fight the Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house\nof Peleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun,\nhe is in heaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him; King\nAgamemnon has made him give up the maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans\nhad awarded him, and he wastes with sorrow for her sake. Then the\nTrojans hemmed the Achaeans in at their ships' sterns and would not\nlet them come forth; the elders, therefore, of the Argives besought\nAchilles and offered him great treasure, whereon he refused to bring\ndeliverance to them himself, but put his own armour on Patroclus and\nsent him into the fight with much people after him. All day long they\nfought by the Scaean gates and would have taken the city there and\nthen, had not Apollo vouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant\nson of Menoetius after he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore\nI am suppliant at your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide\nmy son, whose end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly\ngreaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost\nhis own when his true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and\nhe now lies stretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.\"\n\nAnd Vulcan answered, \"Take heart, and be no more disquieted about\nthis matter; would that I could hide him from death's sight when his\nhour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze\nthe eyes of all who behold it.\" \n\nWhen he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning them\ntowards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows\nblew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some\nfierce to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong\nas Vulcan willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper\ninto the fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil\non its block, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he\ntook the tongs in the other. \n\nFirst he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over\nand binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and\nthe baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five thicknesses,\nand with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it. \n\nHe wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her\nfull and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face\nof heaven- the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which\nmen also call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing.\nOrion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus. \n\nHe wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of men.\nIn the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were going about\nthe city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight from their\nchambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the youths danced to the\nmusic of flute and lyre, while the women stood each at her house door\nto see them. \n\nMeanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a quarrel,\nand two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man who had\nbeen killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid damages\nin full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each was trying\nto make his own case good, and the people took sides, each man backing\nthe side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them back, and the\nelders sate on their seats of stone in a solemn circle, holding the\nstaves which the heralds had put into their hands. Then they rose\nand each in his turn gave judgement, and there were two talents laid\ndown, to be given to him whose judgement should be deemed the fairest.\n\nAbout the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming armour,\nand they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and accept\nthe half of what it contained. But the men of the city would not yet\nconsent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives and little\nchildren kept guard upon the walls, and with them were the men who\nwere past fighting through age; but the others sallied forth with\nMars and Pallas Minerva at their head- both of them wrought in gold\nand clad in golden raiment, great and fair with their armour as befitting\ngods, while they that followed were smaller. When they reached the\nplace where they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to which\nlive stock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here,\nthen, they lay concealed, clad in full armour. Some way off them there\nwere two scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or\ncattle, which presently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing\non their pipes, and had not so much as a thought of danger. When those\nwho were in ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds and\nkilled the shepherds. Meanwhile the besiegers, when they heard much\nnoise among the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses,\nand made with all speed towards them; when they reached them they\nset battle in array by the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed\ntheir bronze-shod spears at one another. With them were Strife and\nRiot, and fell Fate who was dragging three men after her, one with\na fresh wound, and the other unwounded, while the third was dead,\nand she was dragging him along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled\nin men's blood. They went in and out with one another and fought as\nthough they were living people haling away one another's dead.\n\nHe wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed already.\nMany men were working at the plough within it, turning their oxen\nto and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on reaching\nthe headland a man would come up to them and give them a cup of wine,\nand they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the time\nwhen they should again reach the headland. The part that they had\nploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though it was of\ngold, still looked as if it were being ploughed- very curious to behold.\n\nHe wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were reaping\nwith sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to the\nground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them\nin bands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind them\nthere were boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept on bringing\nthem to be bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by in\nsilence and was glad. The servants were getting a meal ready under\nan oak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting\nhim up, while the women were making a porridge of much white barley\nfor the labourers' dinner. \n\nHe wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines\nwere loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the\nvines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal\nall round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one\npath to it, and by this the vintagers went when they would gather\nthe vintage. Youths and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried\nthe luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with them there went a\nboy who made sweet music with his lyre, and sang the Linus-song with\nhis clear boyish voice. \n\nHe wrought also a herd of homed cattle. He made the cows of gold and\ntin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go\nand feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river.\nAlong with the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold,\nand their nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had fastened\non a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as\nhe might they haled him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions\ntore through the bull's thick hide and were gorging on his blood and\nbowels, but the herdsmen were afraid to do anything, and only hounded\non their dogs; the dogs dared not fasten on the lions but stood by\nbarking and keeping out of harm's way. \n\nThe god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and large\nflock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.\n\nFurthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made\nin Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths and maidens\nwhom all would woo, with their hands on one another's wrists. The\nmaidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts\nthat were slightly oiled. The girls were crowned with garlands, while\nthe young men had daggers of gold that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes\nthey would dance deftly in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it\nwere a potter sitting at his work and making trial of his wheel to\nsee whether it will run, and sometimes they would go all in line with\none another, and much people was gathered joyously about the green.\nThere was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two\ntumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck\nup with his tune. \n\nAll round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream\nof the river Oceanus. \n\nThen when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made\na breastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made helmet,\nclose fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume\noverhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin. \n\nLastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took it\nand set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like\na falcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming\narmour from the house of Vulcan. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XIX\n\nNow when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\nOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\nships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\nfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also\nof his followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came\namong them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve\nas we may we must let this man lie, for it is by heaven's will that\nhe has fallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly\narmour, which no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"\n\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out bravely\nas she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none dared\nlook full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\nstill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for\nhe was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had\nmade him. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at\nit, he said to his mother, \"Mother, the god has given me armour, meet\nhandiwork for an immortal and such as no living could have fashioned;\nI will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon the son\nof Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his body, now\nhe is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\" \n\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not disquieted about this\nmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\nflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle.\nHe may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound\nas ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;\nunsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might\nand main.\" \n\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she\nthen dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus,\nthat his body might suffer no change. \n\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called\non the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always\nat the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were\nabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of assembly\nbecause Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so long\nfrom fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus, came\nlimping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they came,\nand took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of all\ncame Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of Antenor\nhad struck him with a spear in battle. \n\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \"Son of\nAtreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\nwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would\nhave been better, had Diana's arrow slain her at the ships on the\nday when I took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an\nAchaean the less would have bitten dust before the foe in the days\nof my anger. It has been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the\nAchaeans will long indeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let\nit be, for it is over. If we have been angry, necessity has schooled\nour anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore,\nbid the Achaeans arm forthwith that I may go out against the Trojans,\nand learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep by the ships or\nno. Glad, I ween, will he be to rest his knees who may fly my spear\nwhen I wield it.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\nhis anger. \n\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\nmiddle of the assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of Mars,\nit is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not\nseemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised\nspeaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest\norator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus,\nand do you other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the\nAchaeans spoken to me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was\nnot I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness\nstruck me mad when we were assembled on the day that I took from Achilles\nthe meed that had been awarded to him. What could I do? All things\nare in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove's daughters,\nshuts men's eyes to their destruction. She walks delicately, not on\nthe solid earth, but hovers over the heads of men to make them stumble\nor to ensnare them. \n\n\"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest whether\nof gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on the\nday when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair city\nof Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, 'Hear me all gods\nand goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day shall\nan Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child\ninto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who\nare of my blood and lineage.' Then said Juno all crafty and full of\nguile, 'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear\nme, O Olympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day\nfall between the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell\nabout him who are of your blood and lineage.' \n\n\"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,\nto his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit\nof Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that\nthe noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with\nchild and in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though\nthere was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena,\nand kept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of\nSaturn, and said, 'Father Jove, lord of the lightning- I have a word\nfor your ear. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son\nto Sthenelus the son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well,\ntherefore, that he should reign over the Argives.' \n\n\"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\nFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again\ninvade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then\nhe whirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down\nfrom heaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he\nwas ever angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel\nlabours that Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty\nHector was killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I\nkept thinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove\nrobbed me of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much\ntreasure by way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your\npeople with you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday\nin your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain\nfight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship,\nthat you may see whether what I give you is enough.\" \n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you\ncan give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them:\nit is in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not\nwell to tarry talking about trifles, for there is a deed which is\nas yet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost,\nand laying low the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one\nof you when he is fighting.\" \n\nThen Ulysses said, \"Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans\nthus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will\nbe no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both\nsides with fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the\nships, for in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle\nthe livelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;\nhowever much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before\nhe knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will\ngrow weary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed\nwith meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay\ntill he has routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and\nbid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts\nin presence of the assembly, that all may see them and you may be\nsatisfied. Moreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that\nhe has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her\nafter the manner of men and women; and do you, too, show yourself\nof a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with\na feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full.\nAs for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future;\nit is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he\nwas wrong in the first instance.\" \n\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of Laertes, your words please me\nwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\nhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the\nname of heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would\nfain fight at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come\nfrom my tent and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do\nI charge you: take some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from\nmy tents the gifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring\nthe women also; furthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those\nthat are with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and\nto the sun.\" \n\nThen said Achilles, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to\nthese matters at some other season, when there is breathing time and\nwhen I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those\nwhom Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain?\nLet the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food,\ntill we have avenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun\nlet them eat their fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my\ntent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades\nare mourning round him. Therefore I can take thought of nothing save\nonly slaughter and blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the Achaeans,\nin battle you are better than I, and that more than a little, but\nin counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater knowledge.\nTherefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of which\nmen soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is wars steward, weighs the upshot,\nit may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped is\nfar heavier than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should\nmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold\ncontinually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let us mourn\nour dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but let those\nof us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight our foes\nmore fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for a second\nsummons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found lagging\nbehind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose the\nfury of war upon the Trojans.\" \n\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with\nMeges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes,\nand Melanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The\nword was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out\nthe seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal\ncauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled\nin useful arts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses\nweighed out the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while\nthe young Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in\nthe middle of the assembly. \n\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a\ngod came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which\nhe wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting\noff some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as\nhe did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly\nto hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and\nprayed saying, \"I call Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to\nwitness, I call also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below\nand take vengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid\nno hand upon the girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise,\nbut that she has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely\nmay heaven visit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those\nwho perjure themselves.\" \n\nHe cut the boar's throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it\nround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes.\nThen Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, \"Father Jove, of\na truth you blind men's eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had\nnot else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken\nBriseis from me against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled\nthe destruction of many an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that\nwe may begin fighting.\" \n\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\nship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to\nthe ship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men\ndrove the horses in among the others. \n\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus,\nflung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,\nand her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she\nwept and said, \"Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left\nyou living; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\nmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father\nand mother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own\ndear brothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus,\neven when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,\ntold me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make Achilles\nmarry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding\nfeast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to me and I shall\nnever cease to grieve for you.\" \n\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as\nthough their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping\nfor her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles\nand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"I\npray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat\nnor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even\nto the going down of the sun.\" \n\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\nAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\nstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:\nbut he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into\nthe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\nPatroclus. Then he said- \n\n\"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\nready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting\nto fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink\nin my tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I\ncould not know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my\nfather, who is now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who\nam here fighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake\nof Helen, nor yet though I should hear that my son is no more- he\nwho is being brought up in Scyros- if indeed Neoptolemus is still\nliving. Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy\naway from Argos, while you were to return to Phthia, bring back my\nson with you in your own ship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen,\nand the greatness of my house- for Peleus must surely be either dead,\nor what little life remains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities\nof age and ever present fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of\nmy death.\" \n\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought\non what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down\nwith pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, \"My child, you\nhave quite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your\nrecollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss\nof his dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner\nhe will neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia\ninto his breast, that he may know no hunger.\" \n\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\nShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing\non his broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\nthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia\ninto Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail\nhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the\nchill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen\nblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets,\nthe bossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen\nspears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the whole\nland was radiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the\ntramp of their treading rose from under their feet. In the midst of\nthem all Achilles put on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes\ngleamed like fire, for his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus,\nthen, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the\ngod, the armour that Vulcan had made him. \n\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next\nhe did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so\ngreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon.\nAs the light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a\nfire in their homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors\nare carried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where\nthey would be- even so did the gleam of Achilles' wondrous shield\nstrike up into the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and\nset it upon his head, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden\nplumes which Vulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved\nall around it. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to\nsee whether it fitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under\nit, and it seemed to buoy him up as though it had been wings.\n\nHe also drew his father's spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\ngreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles\nhad strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the\ntopmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\nfraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied themselves\nwith the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast about\nthem, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back towards\nthe chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the horses,\nand after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as the\nsun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his father's\nhorses saying, \"Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring of Podarge- this\ntime when we have done fighting be sure and bring your driver safely\nback to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him dead on the\nplain as you did Patroclus.\" \n\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke- for white-armed Juno had\nendowed him with human speech- and he bowed his head till his mane\ntouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"Dread\nAchilles,\" said he, \"we will indeed save you now, but the day of your\ndeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven\nand stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth\nor slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his\narmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him\nas he fought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector.\nWe two can fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of\nall winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man\nand of a god.\" \n\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\nanswered him in great sadness, saying, \"Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\nforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\nfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\nshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of fighting.\"\n\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XX\n\nThus, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son\nof Peleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over against\nthem armed upon the rise of the plain. \n\nMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis gather\nthe gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to the\nhouse of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor a\nsingle one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of rivers\nand meadows of green grass. When they reached the house of cloud-compelling\nJove, they took their seats in the arcades of polished marble which\nVulcan with his consummate skill had made for father Jove.\n\nIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. Neptune\nalso, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and\ncame up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of\nthem, he asked what Jove's purpose might be. \"Why,\" said he, \"wielder\nof the lightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you considering\nsome matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans- for the blaze\nof battle is on the point of being kindled between them?\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore\nI have called you hither. I take thought for them even in their destruction.\nFor my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt. Olympus and look on\nin peace, but do you others go about among Trojans and Achaeans, and\nhelp either side as you may be severally disposed. If Achilles fights\nthe Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand against him;\nthey have ever trembled at the sight of him, and now that he is roused\nto such fury about his comrade, he will override fate itself and storm\ntheir city.\" \n\nThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took their\nseveral sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva, earth-encircling\nNeptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent in all cunning-\nall these joined the host that came from the ships; with them also\ncame Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thin legs\nplying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the Trojans,\nand with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer goddess Diana,\nLeto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus. \n\nSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the\nAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight\nwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him\nfor fear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his\narmour, and looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians\ncame to take their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife,\nrouser of hosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by\nthe deep trench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all\nher might upon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out\nupon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called\non the Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and\nnow speeding up the side of the river Simois till he came to the hill\nCallicolone. \n\nThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce contention\nalso among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered from heaven\nabove, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth, and bade the\nhigh hills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained Ida quaked,\nas also the city of the Trojans and the ships of the Achaeans. Hades,\nking of the realms below, was struck with fear; he sprang panic-stricken\nfrom his throne and cried aloud in terror lest Neptune, lord of the\nearthquake, should crack the ground over his head, and lay bare his\nmouldy mansions to the sight of mortals and immortals- mansions so\nghastly grim that even the gods shudder to think of them. Such was\nthe uproar as the gods came together in battle. Apollo with his arrows\ntook his stand to face King Neptune, while Minerva took hers against\nthe god of war; the archer-goddess Diana with her golden arrows, sister\nof far-darting Apollo, stood to face Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer\nof good luck faced Leto, while the mighty eddying river whom men can\nScamander, but gods Xanthus, matched himself against Vulcan.\n\nThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart\nof Achilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was with\nhis blood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn\nlord of battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of\nPeleus, and put courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of\nLycaon son of Priam. In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas,\n\"Aeneas, counsellor of the Trojans, where are now the brave words\nwith which you vaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes, saying\nthat you would fight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?\"\n\nAnd Aeneas answered, \"Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son of\nPeleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it\nwould not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to Right\nfrom Ida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus;\nJove indeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to fly, else\nhad the fallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who went before\nhim to protect him and urged him to fall upon the Lelegae and Trojans.\nNo man may fight Achilles, for one of the gods is always with him\nas his guardian angel, and even were it not so, his weapon flies ever\nstraight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him who is against\nhim; if heaven would let me fight him on even terms he should not\nsoon overcome me, though he boasts that he is made of bronze.\"\n\nThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, \"Nay, hero, pray to the ever-living\ngods, for men say that you were born of Jove's daughter Venus, whereas\nAchilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is child to Jove,\nwhile Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea. Bring, therefore,\nyour spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you with his taunts\nand menaces.\" \n\nAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his people,\nand he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost fighters.\nNor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed Juno,\nas he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called the\ngods about her, and said, \"Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva,\nand consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas\nclad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once,\nor shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so\nthat his heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the immortals\nare on his side, while the others who have all along been defending\nthe Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come down from Olympus\nand join in the fight, that this day he may take no hurt at the hands\nof the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may have spun\nout for him when he was begotten and his mother bore him. If Achilles\nbe not thus assured by the voice of a god, he may come to fear presently\nwhen one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are terrible if they\nare seen face to face.\" \n\nNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, \"Juno, restrain\nyour fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing the other\ngods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side;\nlet us take our places on some hill out of the beaten track, and let\nmortals fight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin\nfighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too,\nwill at once raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will soon\nleave the field and go back vanquished to Olympus among the other\ngods.\" \n\nWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high earth-barrow\nof Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the Trojans and\nPallas Minerva for him fly to when the sea-monster was chasing him\nfrom the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those that were with\nhim took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of darkness; but the\nother gods seated themselves on the brow of Callicolone round you,\nO Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities. \n\nThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side\nwas willing to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat\non high was in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was\nalive with men and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The\nearth rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards\neach other, and two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met\nbetween the hosts to fight- to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble\nAchilles. \n\nAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet tossing\ndefiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his breast,\nand brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the other\nside sprang forth to meet him, fike some fierce lion that the whole\ncountry-side has met to hunt and kill- at first he bodes no ill, but\nwhen some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches openmouthed,\nhis jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail from side to\nside about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs straight before\nhim, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slain among the foremost\nof his foes- even with such fury did Achilles burn to spring upon\nAeneas. \n\nWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to\nspeak. \"Aeneas,\" said he, \"why do you stand thus out before the host\nto fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the\nseat of Priam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom\nover to you. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his\nown. Or have the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness,\nfair with orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This\nyou shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you\nforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds helter-skelter\ndown the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look behind you;\nyou took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and with the\nhelp of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and carried its women\ninto captivity, though Jove and the other gods rescued you. You think\nthey will protect you now, but they will not do so; therefore I say\ngo back into the host, and do not face me, or you will rue it. Even\na fool may be wise after the event.\" \n\nThen Aeneas answered, \"Son of Peleus, think not that your words can\nscare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag and\ntalk unseemly. We know one another's race and parentage as matters\nof common fame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I\nyours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus, and that your mother\nis Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises\nfor my father, and Venus for my mother; the parents of one or other\nof us shall this day mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk\nthat shall part us when the fight is over. Learn, then, my lineage\nif you will- and it is known to many. \n\n\"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded Dardania,\nfor Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to dwell in,\nand her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanus\nhad a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living;\nhe had three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and\ntheir foals with them. Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding,\nand covered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve\nfilly foals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped\nover the rich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn\nand not break them; or again when they would disport themselves on\nthe broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker.\nErichthonius begat Tros, king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble\nsons, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men;\nwherefore the gods carried him off to be Jove's cupbearer, for his\nbeauty's sake, that he might dwell among the immortals. Ilus begat\nLaomedon, and Laomedon begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and\nHiketaon of the stock of Mars. But Assaracus was father to Capys,\nand Capys to Anchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to Priam.\n\n\"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove gives\nit or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let there\nbe no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children.\nWe could fling taunts without end at one another; a hundred-oared\ngalley would not hold them. The tongue can run all whithers and talk\nall wise; it can go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he\nbe gainsaid. What is the use of our bandying hard like women who when\nthey fall foul of one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one\nhalf true and the other lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours\nshall turn me now that I am fain to fight- therefore let us make trial\nof one another with our spears.\" \n\nAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of\nAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus\nheld the shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid,\nfor he deemed that Aeneas's spear would go through it quite easily,\nnot reflecting that the god's glorious gifts were little likely to\nyield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas's spear did\nnot pierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed\nthe point. It went through two layers, but the god had made the shield\nin five, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and one of\ngold; it was in this that the spear was stayed. \n\nAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas\nat the very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian\nash went clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas\nwas afraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him;\nthe spear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the\nground, after having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield.\nAeneas though he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded with\nfear and grief because the weapon had gone so near him; then Achilles\nsprang furiously upon him, with a cry as of death and with his keen\nblade drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men,\nas men now are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it\nquite easily. \n\nAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards\nhim, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and\nAchilles would have closed with him and despatched him with his sword,\nhad not Neptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said\nforthwith to the immortals, \"Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who\nwill now go down to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of Peleus.\nFool that he was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will\nnever save him from destruction. Why should this man suffer when he\nis guiltless, to no purpose, and in another's quarrel? Has he not\nat all times offered acceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in\nheaven? Let us then snatch him from death's jaws, lest the son of\nSaturn be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that\nhe should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved above\nall the sons born to him of mortal women, shall not perish utterly\nwithout seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated the blood of Priam,\nwhile Aeneas shall reign over the Trojans, he and his children's children\nthat shall be born hereafter.\" \n\nThen answered Juno, \"Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and\nconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him,\nbrave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus.\nFor of a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full many\na time before all the immortals, that never would we shield Trojans\nfrom destruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the flames\nthat the Achaeans shall kindle.\" \n\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle amid\nthe clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and Aeneas\nwere. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of Peleus,\ndrew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas, and\nlaid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on high from\noff the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band\nof warriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god's hand sped\nhim, till he came to the very fringe of the battle where the Cauconians\nwere arming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then\ncame near to him and said, Aeneas, what god has egged you on to this\nfolly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a mightier man of\nvalour and more beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before him\nwhensoever you meet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades even\nthough fate would have it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may\nthen fight among the foremost undaunted, for none other of the Achaeans\nshall slay you.\" \n\nThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at\nonce removed the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened\nthem wide indeed and said in great anger, \"Alas! what marvel am I\nnow beholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him\nwhom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must\nbe under heaven's protection, although I had thought his boasting\nwas idle. Let him go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me further,\nseeing how narrowly he has missed being killed. I will now give my\norders to the Danaans and attack some other of the Trojans.\"\n\nHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did\nso. \"Let not the Trojans,\" he cried, \"keep you at arm's length, Achaeans,\nbut go for them and fight them man for man. However valiant I may\nbe, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. Even Mars,\nwho is an immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from flinging himself\ninto the jaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless,\nso far as in me lies I will show no slackness of hand or foot nor\nwant of endurance, not even for a moment; I will utterly break their\nranks, and woe to the Trojan who shall venture within reach of my\nspear.\" \n\nThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans\nand declared that he would fight Achilles. \"Be not afraid, proud Trojans,\"\nsaid he, \"to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if\nthe battle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match\nfor me, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of Achilles\nwill fall somewhat short of his word; he will do in part, and the\nother part he will clip short. I will go up against him though his\nhands be as fire- though his hands be fire and his strength iron.\"\n\nThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans,\nand raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into the midst\nof their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and said, \"Hector,\non no account must you challenge Achilles to single combat; keep a\nlookout for him while you are under cover of the others and away from\nthe thick of the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear\nor cut you down at close quarters.\" \n\nThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was afraid\nwhen he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then sprang upon\nthe Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment.\nFirst he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much people\nwhom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities, in the\nland of Hyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck\nhim full on the head as he was coming on towards him, and split it\nclean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted\nover him saying, \"You he low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your\ndeath is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your\nfather's estate lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters\nof Hermus.\" \n\nThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The\nchariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him\nin the front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon,\na valiant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple\nthrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear,\nbut it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was\nshed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended. Then he\nstruck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from his\nchariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed his last,\nbellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to offer\nhim in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the earth-shaker\nis glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles then went\nin pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his father had always forbidden\nto fight because he was the youngest of his sons, the one he loved\nbest, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and showing off the\nfleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranks until he\nlost his life, for Achilles struck him in the middle of the back as\nhe was darting past him: he struck him just at the golden fastenings\nof his belt and where the two pieces of the double breastplate overlapped.\nThe point of the spear pierced him through and came out by the navel,\nwhereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of darkness overshadowed\nhim as he sank holding his entrails in his hands. \n\nWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands\nand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he\ncould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his\nspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles\nsaw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, \"This is he that has\nwounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not\nfor long shall we two quail before one another on the highways of\nwar.\" \n\nHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, \"Draw near, that you may meet\nyour doom the sooner.\" Hector feared him not and answered, \"Son of\nPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a\nchild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you\nare a mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue\nlies in the the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may\nnot slay you with my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now.\"\n\nHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and\nthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going\ntowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet\nin front of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud\ncry, bent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god\ncan, and hid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards\nhim spear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air.\nWhen he rushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god,\nhe shouted aloud saying, \"Hound, this time too you have escaped death-\nbut of a truth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom\nit seems you pray before you go into battle, has again saved you;\nbut if I too have any friend among the gods I will surely make an\nend of you when I come across you at some other time. Now, however,\nI will pursue and overtake other Trojans.\" \n\nOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck,\nand he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and stayed\nDemouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature,\nby hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his\nsword and killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and Dardanus,\nsons of Bias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow\nfrom a thrown spear, while the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight.\nThere was also Tros the son of Alastor- he came up to Achilles and\nclasped his knees in the hope that he would spare him and not kill\nhim but let him go, because they were both of the same age. Fool,\nhe might have known that he should not prevail with him, for the man\nwas in no mood for pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore\nwhen Tros laid hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers,\nAchilles drove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling\nout, while his bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled\nfrom the wound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.\n\nAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a spear,\nand the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He also\nstruck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which became\nwarm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of\nEcheclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded Deucalion\nin the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon\nhe waited Achilles' onset with his arm hanging down and death staring\nhim in the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword\nand flung it helmet and all away from him, and the marrow came oozing\nout of his backbone as he lay. He then went in pursuit of Rhigmus,\nnoble son of Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and struck\nhim through the middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly,\nso that he fell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areithous\nsquire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in flight,\nand thrust him from his chariot, while the horses were struck with\npanic. \n\nAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought- and the\ndense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of\nfire in every direction- even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding\nhis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom\nhe would slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes\nbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor-\nand it is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle-\neven so did the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies\nof the slain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the\ncar were bespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses'\nhoofs, and from the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed\non to win still further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with\ngore. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XXI\n\nNow when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,\nbegotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: one half\nhe chased over the plain towards the city by the same way that the\nAchaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding day\nwith Hector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and\nJuno sent down a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other\nhalf were hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into\nit with a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again,\nas they swam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirling\neddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire-\nthe flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they\nhuddle into the water- even so was the eddying stream of Xanthus filled\nwith the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in confusion before\nAchilles. \n\nForthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it against\na tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god, armed with\nhis sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the Trojans down\non every side. Their dying groans rose hideous as the sword smote\nthem, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish fly scared before\na huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven-\nfor he is sure to eat all he can catch- even so did the Trojans cower\nunder the banks of the mighty river, and when Achilles' arms grew\nweary with killing them, he drew twelve youths alive out of the water,\nto sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of Menoetius. He drew them\nout like dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the girdles\nof their own shirts, and gave them over to his men to take back to\nthe ships. Then he sprang into the river, thirsting for still further\nblood. \n\nThere he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was escaping\nout of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner when he\nwas in his father's vineyard, having set upon him by night, as he\nwas cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker sides\nof a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares, and\nsent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him. But\na guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum, and\nsent him to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his father's\nhouse. He had spent eleven days happily with his friends after he\nhad come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again delivered him\ninto the hands of Achilles, who was to send him to the house of Hades\nsorely against his will. He was unarmed when Achilles caught sight\nof him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear,\nfor he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank, and was\nsweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that his strength\nwas now failing him. \n\nThen Achilles said to himself in his surprise, \"What marvel do I see\nhere? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over\ninto Lemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising\nfrom the world below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison\nhim, as they do many another whether he will or no? This time let\nhim taste my spear, that I may know for certain whether mother earth\nwho can keep even a strong man down, will be able to hold him, or\nwhether thence too he will return.\" \n\nThus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and\ntrying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.\nAchilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaon\nran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed\nover his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was for\nblood. With one hand he caught Achilles' knees as he besought him,\nand with the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go.\nThen he said, \"Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am\nyour suppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the\nday when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold\naway to Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you\nthe price of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times as much to gain\nmy freedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after\nmuch suffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.\nSurely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you\na second time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me,\ndaughter of aged Altes- of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegae\nand holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married his\ndaughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,\nboth of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus\nas he was fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall\nme, for I fear that I shall not escape you since heaven has delivered\nme over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart,\nspare me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew your brave\nand noble comrade.\" \n\nWith such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles; but\nAchilles answered him sternly. \"Idiot,\" said he, \"talk not to me of\nransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojans quarter,\nand sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive; but\nnow not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands\nbefore the city of Ilius- and of all Trojans it shall fare hardest\nwith the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall die. Why\nshould you whine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was a better\nman than you are. I too- see you not how I am great and goodly? I\nam son to a noble father, and have a goddess for my mother, but the\nhands of doom and death overshadow me all as surely. The day will\ncome, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when one shall take\nmy life also in battle, either with his spear, or with an arrow sped\nfrom his bow.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and Lycaon's heart sank within him. He loosed his\nhold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achilles\ndrew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck;\nhe plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon\nhe lay at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from\nhim till the earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot\nand flung him into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him\nthe while, and saying, \"Lie there among the fishes, who will lick\nthe blood from your wound and gloat over it; your mother shall not\nlay you on any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall\nbear you into the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed\non the fat of Lycaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the waters-\nso perish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilius- you\nin flight, and I following after to destroy you. The river with its\nbroad silver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls\nyou offered him and all the horses that you flung living into his\nwaters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not\na man of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and the\nhavoc you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while I held\naloof from battle.\" \n\nSo spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and pondered\nwithin himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles and save the\nTrojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear in hand,\nsprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He was son to\nthe broad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter of Acessamenus;\nfor the river had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up out of the water\nto face him with a spear in either hand, and Xanthus filled him with\ncourage, being angry for the death of the youths whom Achilles was\nslaying ruthlessly within his waters. When they were close up with\none another Achilles was first to speak. \"Who and whence are you,\"\nsaid he, \"who dare to face me? Woe to the parents whose son stands\nup against me.\" And the son of Pelegon answered, \"Great son of Peleus,\nwhy should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile land of far Paeonia,\ncaptain of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven days that I am at Ilius.\nI am of the blood of the river Axius- of Axius that is the fairest\nof all rivers that run. He begot the famed warrior Pelegon, whose\nson men call me. Let us now fight, Achilles.\" \n\nThus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash.\nAsteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both hands\nalike; with the one spear he struck Achilles' shield, but did not\npierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;\nwith the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right arm drawing\ndark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the\nground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill\nhim, hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck\nthe steep bank of the river, driving the spear half its length into\nthe earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword and sprang furiously\nupon him. Asteropaeus vainly tried to draw Achilles' spear out of\nthe bank by main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his\nmight to draw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the fourth\ntime he tried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so Achilles\nsmote him with his sword and killed him. He struck him in the belly\nnear the navel, so that all his bowels came gushing out on to the\nground, and the darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping.\nThen Achilles set his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armour,\nvaunting over him and saying, \"Lie there- begotten of a river though\nyou be, it is hard for you to strive with the offspring of Saturn's\nson. You declare yourself sprung from the blood of a broad river,\nbut I am of the seed of mighty Jove. My father is Peleus, son of Aeacus\nruler over the many Myrmidons, and Aeacus was the son of Jove. Therefore\nas Jove is mightier than any river that flows into the sea, so are\nhis children stronger than those of any river whatsoever. Moreover\nyou have a great river hard by if he can be of any use to you, but\nthere is no fighting against Jove the son of Saturn, with whom not\neven King Achelous can compare, nor the mighty stream of deep-flowing\nOceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with all springs and deep wells\nproceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings of great Jove, and his\nthunder that comes crashing out of heaven.\" \n\nWith this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that he\nhad killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand, with\nthe dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy nibbling\nand gnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he went in chase\nof the Paeonians, who were flying along the bank of the river in panic\nwhen they saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of Peleus.\nTherein he slew Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus, Mnesus, Thrasius,\nOeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not\nthe river in anger taken human form, and spoken to him from out the\ndeep waters saying, \"Achilles, if you excel all in strength, so do\nyou also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to protect\nyou: if, then, the son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to you to destroy\nall the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream, and do your\ngrim work on land. My fair waters are now filled with corpses, nor\ncan I find any channel by which I may pour myself into the sea for\nI am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilessly slaying. I am\nin despair, therefore, O captain of your host, trouble me no further.\"\n\nAchilles answered, \"So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I will\nnever cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pent\nthem up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that\nI may learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him.\" \n\nAs he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the gods.\nBut the river said to Apollo, \"Surely, son of Jove, lord of the silver\nbow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who charged you straitly\nthat you should stand by the Trojans and defend them, till twilight\nfades, and darkness is over an the earth.\" \n\nMeanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon the\nriver raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his stream into\na torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain and\nleft within his waters. These he cast out on to the land, bellowing\nlike a bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding them\nin his mighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gathered about Achilles,\nfalling upon him and beating on his shield, so that he could not keep\nhis feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but it came up by the\nroots, and tore away the bank, damming the stream with its thick branches\nand bridging it all across; whereby Achilles struggled out of the\nstream, and fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid.\n\nBut the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him\nwith a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojans from\ndestruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear's throw from him;\nswift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest\nand fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and the\narmour rang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but the\nriver with a loud roar came tearing after. As one who would water\nhis garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, and\nall his ground-spade in hand he clears away the dams to free the channels,\nand the little stones run rolling round and round with the water as\nit goes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow- even\nso did the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a fleet\nrunner, for the gods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive\nto stand his ground, and see whether or no all the gods in heaven\nwere in league against him, so often would the mighty wave come beating\ndown upon his shoulders, and be would have to keep flying on and on\nin great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as it flowed\npast him and ate the ground from under his feet. \n\nThen the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, \"Father\nJove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save\nme from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards.\nI blame none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do\nmy dear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was\nto fall under the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would\nthat Hector, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me;\nthen should I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems\nthat I shall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river as\nthough I were some swineherd's boy, who gets carried down a torrent\nwhile trying to cross it during a storm.\" \n\nAs soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him\nin the likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.\nNeptune spoke first. \"Son of Peleus,\" said he, \"be not so exceeding\nfearful; we are two gods, come with Jove's sanction to assist you,\nI, and Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river;\nhe will abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise\nyou, if you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting\ntill you have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius-\nas many of them as may escape. Then kill Hector and go back to the\nships, for we will vouchsafe you a triumph over him.\" \n\nWhen they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but Achilles\nstrove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge the gods had\nlaid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of waters, and much\ngoodly armour of the youths that had been slain was rifting about,\nas also many corpses, but he forced his way against the stream, speeding\nright onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, for Minerva had\nendowed him with great strength. Nevertheless Scamander did not slacken\nin his pursuit, but was still more furious with the son of Peleus.\nHe lifted his waters into a high crest and cried aloud to Simois saying,\n\"Dear brother, let the two of us unite to save this man, or he will\nsack the mighty city of King Priam, and the Trojans will not hold\nout against him. Help me at once; fill your streams with water from\ntheir sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your wave\non high, and let snags and stones come thundering down you that we\nmay make an end of this savage creature who is now lording it as though\nhe were a god. Nothing shall serve him longer, not strength nor comeliness,\nnor his fine armour, which forsooth shall soon be lying low in the\ndeep waters covered over with mud. I will wrap him in sand, and pour\ntons of shingle round him, so that the Achaeans shall not know how\nto gather his bones for the silt in which I shall have hidden him,\nand when they celebrate his funeral they need build no barrow.\"\n\nOn this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles, seething\nas it was with foam and blood and the bo&ies of the dead. The dark\nwaters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed the son\nof Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be swept away\nin the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to\nVulcan her son. \"Crook-foot,\" she cried, \"my child, be up and doing,\nfor I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us at\nonce, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and the\nwhite south wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear\nthe flames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consume\nthem, while you go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees and\nwrapping him round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither by\nfair words nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then\nyou may stay your flames.\" \n\nOn this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon the\nplain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whose\nbodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain\nwas dried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on an orchard\nthat has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and the heart\nof the owner is glad- even so the whole plan was dried and the dead\nbodies were consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on to the river.\nHe burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus also,\nwith the rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by the banks\nof the river. The eels and fishes that go darting about everywhere\nin the water, these, too, were sorely harassed by the flames that\ncunning Vulcan had kindled, and the river himself was scalded, so\nthat he spoke saying, \"Vulcan, there is no god can hold his own against\nyou. I cannot fight you when you flare out your flames in this way;\nstrive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive the Trojans out of city\nimmediately. What have I to do with quarrelling and helping people?\"\n\nHe was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As a\ncauldron upon 'a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of some\nfatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the dry faggots\nblaze under it- even so were the goodly waters of Xanthus heated with\nthe fire till they were boiling. He could flow no longer but stayed\nhis stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts of fire which cunning\nVulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno and besought her saying,\n\"Juno, why should your son vex my stream with such especial fury?\nI am not so much to blame as all the others are who have been helping\nthe Trojans. I will leave off, since you so desire it, and let son\nleave off also. Furthermore I swear never again will I do anything\nto save the Trojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is burning\nin the flames which the Achaeans will kindle.\" \n\nAs soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, \"Son Vulcan,\nhold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence against a\ngod for the sake of mortals.\" \n\nWhen she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the river\nwent back once more into his own fair bed. \n\nXanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno stayed\nthem though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke out among\nthe other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fell on one\nanother with a mighty uproar- earth groaned, and the spacious firmament\nrang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he was sitting\non Olympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows\namong themselves. They were not long about beginning, and Mars piercer\nof shields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at once upon\nMinerva and reviled her. \"Why, vixen,\" said he, \"have you again set\nthe gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of your heart? Have\nyou forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound me, and\nyourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurt of my\nfair body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to me.\"\n\nAs he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis- so terrible\nthat not even can Jove's lightning pierce it. Here did murderous Mars\nstrike her with his great spear. She drew back and with her strong\nhand seized a stone that was lying on the plain- great and rugged\nand black- which men of old had set for the boundary of a field. With\nthis she struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down. Nine roods\ndid he cover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled in the dust,\nwhile his armour rang rattling round him. But Minerva laughed and\nvaunted over him saying, \"Idiot, have you not learned how far stronger\nI am than you, but you must still match yourself against me? Thus\ndo your mother's curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would\ndo you mischief because you have deserted the Achaeans and are helping\nthe Trojans.\" \n\nShe then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove's daughter\nVenus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all the time,\nfor it was only with great difficulty that he had come to himself\nagain. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, \"Look, daughter\nof aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is again taking\nMars through the crowd out of the battle; go after her at once.\"\n\nThus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made at\nher, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fell\nfainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full\nlength. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, \"May all who help the\nTrojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart\nas Venus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Had\nthis been so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking the\nstrong city of Ilius.\" \n\nJuno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo\nsaying, \"Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm's length? it\nis not well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be disgraceful\nto us if we return to Jove's bronze-floored mansion on Olympus without\nhaving fought each other; therefore come on, you are the younger of\nthe two, and I ought not to attack you, for I am older and have had\nmore experience. Idiot, you have no sense, and forget how we two alone\nof all the gods fared hardly round about Ilius when we came from Jove's\nhouse and worked for Laomedon a whole year at a stated wage and he\ngave us his orders. I built the Trojans the wall about their city,\nso wide and fair that it might be impregnable, while you, Phoebus,\nherded cattle for him in the dales of many valleyed Ida. When, however,\nthe glad hours brought round the time of payment, mighty Laomedon\nrobbed us of all our hire and sent us off with nothing but abuse.\nHe threatened to bind us hand and foot and sell us over into some\ndistant island. He tried, moreover, to cut off the ears of both of\nus, so we went away in a rage, furious about the payment he had promised\nus, and yet withheld; in spite of all this, you are now showing favour\nto his people, and will not join us in compassing the utter ruin of\nthe proud Trojans with their wives and children.\" \n\nAnd King Apollo answered, \"Lord of the earthquake, you would have\nno respect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserable\nmortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the\nfield, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay this\nfighting at once and let them settle it among themselves.\"\n\nHe turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the brother\nof his own father. But his sister the huntress Diana, patroness of\nwild beasts, was very angry with him and said, \"So you would fly,\nFar-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheap vaunt to\nboot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear you\nbragging in my father's house, as you have often done in the presence\nof the immortals, that you would stand up and fight with Neptune.\"\n\nApollo made her no answer, but Jove's august queen was angry and upbraided\nher bitterly. \"Bold vixen,\" she cried, \"how dare you cross me thus?\nFor all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own against me.\nJove made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill them whenever\nyou choose. You will And it better to chase wild beasts and deer upon\nthe mountains than to fight those who are stronger than you are. If\nyou would try war, do so, and find out by pitting yourself against\nme, how far stronger I am than you are.\" \n\nShe caught both Diana's wrists with her left hand as she spoke, and\nwith her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as\nshe beat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhed\nunder her blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she\nfled weeping from under Juno's hand as a dove that flies before a\nfalcon to the cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune\nto escape. Even so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows\nbehind her. \n\nThen the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, \"Leto,\nI shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove's\nwives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you worsted\nme in fair fight.\" \n\nLeto then gathered up Diana's bow and arrows that had fallen about\namid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all haste\nafter her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove's bronze-floored mansion\non Olympus, and sat herself down with many tears on the knees of her\nfather, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all about her. The\nson of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughing pleasantly the while\nbegan to question her saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings, my dear\nchild, has been treating you in this cruel manner, as though you had\nbeen misconducting yourself in the face of everybody?\" and the fair-crowned\ngoddess of the chase answered, \"It was your wife Juno, father, who\nhas been beating me; it is always her doing when there is any quarrelling\namong the immortals.\" \n\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the strong\ncity of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not hold out\nand the Danaans should take the city then and there, before its hour\nhad come; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back, some angry\nand some triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats beside\nJove lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on dealing\nout death alike on the Trojans and on their As when the smoke from\nsome burning city ascends to heaven when the anger of the gods has\nkindled it- there is then toil for all, and sorrow for not a few-\neven so did Achilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.\n\nOld King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on huge\nAchilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there\nwas none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower and\nwith many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave\nwarders of the gate. \"Keep the gates,\" said he, \"wide open till the\npeople come flying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving\nthem in rout before him. I see we are in great peril. As soon as our\npeople are inside and in safety, close the strong gates for I fear\nlest that terrible man should come bounding inside along with the\nothers.\" \n\nAs he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and when\nthese were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans. Apollo\nthen came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect them.\nRight for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and grimy\nwith dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding his spear furiously\nbehind them. For he was as one possessed, and was thirsting after\nglory. \n\nThen had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy if\nApollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor.\nHe put courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him,\nleaning against a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. When\nAgenor saw Achilles he stood still and his heart was clouded with\ncare. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in his dismay, \"if I fly before mighty\nAchilles, and go where all the others are being driven in rout, he\nwill none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How would it\nbe were I to let Achilles drive the others before him, and then fly\nfrom the wall to the plain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spurs\nof Ida and can hide in the underwood that is thereon? I could then\nwash the sweat from off me in the river and in the evening return\nto Ilius. But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he\nwould see me as I am hurrying from the city over the plain, and would\nspeed after me till he had caught me- I should stand no chance against\nhim, for he is mightiest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out and\nmeet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be pierced\nby pointed bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and men say that\nhe is but mortal despite the triumph that Jove son of Saturn vouchsafes\nhim.\" \n\nSo saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was now\nfain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert\nto attack a hunter- she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the baying\nof the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and wound\nher either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has pierced\nher she will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip\nor been killed outright- even so did noble Agenor son of Antenor refuse\nto fly till he had made trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with\nhis spear, holding his round shield before him and crying with a loud\nvoice. \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"noble Achilles, you deem that you shall\nthis day sack the city of the proud Trojans. Fool, there will be trouble\nenough yet before it, for there is many a brave man of us still inside\nwho will stand in front of our dear parents with our wives and children,\nto defend Ilius. Here therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you\nbe, here shall you cue. \n\nAs he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the spear\nstruck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newly wrought\ntin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him whom\nit had struck, and did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayed it.\nAchilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not vouchsafe\nhim glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a thick mist,\nsending him out of the battle unmolested Then he craftily drew the\nson of Peleus away from going after the host, for he put on the semblance\nof Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who ran towards him to give\nhim chase and pursued him over the corn lands of the plain, turning\nhim towards the deep waters of the river Scamander. Apollo ran but\na little way before him and beguiled Achilles by making him think\nall the time that he was on the point of overtaking him. Meanwhile\nthe rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd within the city\ntill their numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare wait for one\nanother outside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were\nfallen in fight, but all whose feet and knees could still carry them\npoured pell-mell into the town. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XXII\n\nThus the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat\nfrom off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the\ngoodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon\ntheir shoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector\nstay where he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus\nApollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, \"Why, son of Peleus, do\nyou, who are but man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not\nyet found out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did\nnot harass the Trojans whom you had routed, and now they are within\ntheir walls, while you have been decoyed hither away from them. Me\nyou cannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me.\" \n\nAchilles was greatly angered and said, \"You have baulked me, Far-Darter,\nmost malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from the wall,\nwhere many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got within\nIlius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved the Trojans\nat no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I would\nindeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.\"\n\nOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winning\nhorse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is flying over\nthe plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of Achilles bear\nhim onwards. King Priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain,\nall radiant as the star which men call Orion's Hound, and whose beams\nblaze forth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any\nother that shines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he\nyet bodes ill for mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train-\neven so did Achilles' armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards.\nPriam raised a cry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them\nup and shouted out to his dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector\nstill stayed before the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle\nwith Achilles. The old man reached out his arms towards him and bade\nhim for pity's sake come within the walls. \"Hector,\" he cried, \"my\nson, stay not to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will\nmeet death at the hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than\nyou. Monster that he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better\nthan I do, for so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay\nstretched on earth, and a load of grief would be lifted from my heart,\nfor many a brave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or\nselling them away in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now\nI miss two sons from among the Trojans who have thronged within the\ncity, Lycaon and Polydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore\nme. Should they be still alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we\nwill ransom them with gold and bronze, of which we have store, for\nthe old man Altes endowed his daughter richly; but if they are already\ndead and in the house of Hades, sorrow will it be to us two who were\ntheir parents; albeit the grief of others will be more short-lived\nunless you too perish at the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son,\nwithin the city, to be the guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women,\nor you will both lose your own life and afford a mighty triumph to\nthe son of Peleus. Have pity also on your unhappy father while life\nyet remains to him- on me, whom the son of Saturn will destroy by\na terrible doom on the threshold of old age, after I have seen my\nsons slain and my daughters haled away as captives, my bridal chambers\npillaged, little children dashed to earth amid the rage of battle,\nand my sons' wives dragged away by the cruel hands of the Achaeans;\nin the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces at my own gates after\nsome one has beaten the life out of my body with sword or spear-hounds\nthat I myself reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates, but\nwho will yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors.\nWhen a young man falls by the sword in battle, he may lie where he\nis and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be seen, all is honourable\nin death, but when an old man is slain there is nothing in this world\nmore pitiable than that dogs should defile his grey hair and beard\nand all that men hide for shame.\" \n\nThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heart\nof Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared her\nbosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. \"Hector,\" she\ncried, weeping bitterly the while, \"Hector, my son, spurn not this\nbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort\nfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the\nwall to protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should\nthe wretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall\never weep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie,\nfor dogs will devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.\" \n\nThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved\nnot the heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles\nas he drew nearer towards him. As serpent in its den upon the mountains,\nfull fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man- he is\nfilled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes writhing round\nhis den- even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted\nout from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted. \n\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, \"if I go\nwithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon\nme, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city\non that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would\nnot listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so.\nNow that my folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men\nand Trojan women in the face, lest a worse man should say, 'Hector\nhas ruined us by his self-confidence.' Surely it would be better for\nme to return after having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die\ngloriously here before the city. What, again, if were to lay down\nmy shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight\nup to noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen,\nwho was the fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that\nAlexandrus brought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let\nthe Achaeans divide the half of everything that the city contains\namong themselves? I might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their\nprinces, take a solemn oath that they would hide nothing, but would\ndivide into two shares all that is within the city- but why argue\nwith myself in this way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no\nkind of mercy; he would kill me then and there as easily as though\nI were a woman, when I had off my armour. There is no parleying with\nhim from some rock or oak tree as young men and maidens prattle with\none another. Better fight him at once, and learn to which of us Jove\nwill vouchsafe victory.\" \n\nThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were\nMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he brandished\nhis terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed around him\nlike flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell upon Hector\nas he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he was but fled\nin dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted after him at\nhis utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds, swoops\ndown upon some cowering dove- the dove flies before him but the falcon\nwith a shrill scream follows close after, resolved to have her- even\nso did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might, while\nHector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take\nhim. \n\nOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall,\npast the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree,\ntill they came to two fair springs which feed the river Scamander.\nOne of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke\nfrom a burning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as hail\nor snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs,\nare the goodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace\nbefore the coming of the Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of\nthe Trojans used to wash their clothes. Past these did they fly, the\none in front and the other giving ha. behind him: good was the man\nthat fled, but better far was he that followed after, and swiftly\nindeed did they run, for the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice\nor bullock's hide, as it might be for a common foot-race, but they\nran for the life of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speed round\nthe turning-posts when they are running for some great prize- a tripod\nor woman- at the games in honour of some dead hero, so did these two\nrun full speed three times round the city of Priam. All the gods watched\nthem, and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\n\n\"Alas,\" said he, \"my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursued\nround the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hector, who\nhas burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, at one while\non the of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and\nnow I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of\nPriam. What say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether\nwe shall now save him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before\nAchilles, son of Peleus.\" \n\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud\nand storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom has\nlong been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we\nothers shall not be of a mind with you.\" \n\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not speak\nin full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without let\nor hindrance as you are minded.\" \n\nThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she darted\nfrom the topmost summits of Olympus. \n\nAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a\nfawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts\nthrough glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by crouching\nunder cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up\nuntil he gets her- even so there was no escape for Hector from the\nfleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian\ngates and under the walls, that his people might help him by showering\ndown weapons from above, Achilles would gain on him and head him back\ntowards the plain, keeping himself always on the city side. As a man\nin a dream who fails to lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing-\nthe one cannot escape nor the other overtake- even so neither could\nAchilles come up with Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles;\nnevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time\ncome when Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved\nhis running, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs\nto the Achaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to\naim a dart at Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit\nhim and he might himself come in second. Then, at last, as they were\nnearing the fountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced\nhis golden scales and placed a doom in each of them, one for Achilles\nand the other for Hector. As he held the scales by the middle, the\ndoom of Hector fell down deep into the house of Hades- and then Phoebus\nApollo left him. Thereon Minerva went close up to the son of Peleus\nand said, \"Noble Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely\ntake back to the ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector,\nfor all his lust of battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling\nbefore his father, aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer.\nStay here and take breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to\nmake a stand and fight you.\" \n\nThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still, leaning\non his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him and went\nafter Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She came\nclose up to him and said, \"Dear brother, I see you are hard pressed\nby Achilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of Priam,\nlet us await his onset and stand on our defence.\" \n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to me\nof all my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth I\nshall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside\nthe wall for my sake when all the others remain inside.\"\n\nThen Minerva said, \"Dear brother, my father and mother went down on\ntheir knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside,\nso great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of\ngrief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and\nfight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we\nmay learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to\nthe ships, or whether he shall fall before you.\" \n\nThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were\nnow close to one another great Hector was first to speak. \"I will-no\nlonger fly you, son of Peleus,\" said he, \"as I have been doing hitherto.\nThree times have I fled round the mighty city of Priam, without daring\nto withstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for I am\nin the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one another\nby our gods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants;\nlet it be agreed between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer\nstay and I take your life, I am not to treat your dead body in any\nunseemly fashion, but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am\nto give up your body to the Achaeans. And do you likewise.\"\n\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Fool, prate not to me about\ncovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves\nand lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out\nan through. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and\nme, nor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall\nfall and glut grim Mars with his life's blood. Put forth all your\nstrength; you have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier\nand man of war. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith\nvanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief\nyou have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have killed\nin battle.\" \n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it coming\nand avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over\nhis head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it\nup and gave it back to Achilles without Hector's seeing her; Hector\nthereon said to the son of Peleus, \"You have missed your aim, Achilles,\npeer of the gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of\nmy doom, though you made sure that he had done so. You were a false-tongued\nliar when you deemed that I should forget my valour and quail before\nyou. You shall not drive spear into the back of a runaway- drive it,\nshould heaven so grant you power, drive it into me as I make straight\ntowards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can-\nwould that you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you\nwere once dead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for\nit is you who have harmed them most.\" \n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true for\nhe hit the middle of Achilles' shield, but the spear rebounded from\nit, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon\nhad sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had\nno second spear. With a loud cry he called Diphobus and asked him\nfor one, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself,\n\"Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that\nthe hero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the wall, and\nMinerva has inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at\nhand and there is no way out of it- for so Jove and his son Apollo\nthe far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever\nready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die\ningloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great\nthing that shall be told among men hereafter.\" \n\nAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by\nhis side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like\na soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb\nor timid hare- even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon\nAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous\nshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four\nlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of gold\nwi which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the\nevening star that shines brighter than all others through the stillness\nof night, even such was the gleam of the spear which Achilles poised\nin his right hand, fraught with the death of noble Hector. He eyed\nhis fair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it,\nbut all was protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had spoiled\nPatroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat where the collar-bones\ndivide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a most deadly place:\nhere then did Achilles strike him as he was coming on towards him,\nand the point of his spear went right through the fleshy part of the\nneck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could still speak.\nHector fell headlong, and Achilles vaunted over him saying, \"Hector,\nyou deemed that you should come off scatheless when you were spoiling\nPatroclus, and recked not of myself who was not with him. Fool that\nyou were: for I, his comrade, mightier far than he, was still left\nbehind him at the ships, and now I have laid you low. The Achaeans\nshall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and vultures shall\nwork their will upon yourself.\" \n\nThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, \"I pray you by your\nlife and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at the\nships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronze\nwhich my father and mother will offer you, and send my body home,\nthat the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when\nI am dead.\" \n\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Dog, talk not to me neither\nof knees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able\nto cut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill have done\nme, as I am that nothing shall save you from the dogs- it shall not\nbe, though they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for\nme on the spot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son\nof Dardanus should bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so\nyour mother shall never lay you out and make lament over the son she\nbore, but dogs and vultures shall eat you utterly up.\" \n\nHector with his dying breath then said, \"I know you what you are,\nand was sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as\niron; look to it that I bring not heaven's anger upon you on the day\nwhen Paris and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you\nat the Scaean gates.\" \n\nWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his\nsoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting\nits sad fate that it should en' youth and strength no longer. But\nAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, \"Die; for my part I will\naccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send\nit.\" \n\nAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side;\nthen he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector's shoulders\nwhile the other Achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength\nand beauty; and no one came near him without giving him a fresh wound.\nThen would one turn to his neighbour and say, \"It is easier to handle\nHector now than when he was flinging fire on to our ships\" and as\nhe spoke he would thrust his spear into him anew. \n\nWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among\nthe Argives and said, \"My friends, princes and counsellors of the\nArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who\nhas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether\nwe should not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind\nthe Trojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert\ntheir city now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out even\nthough he is no longer living. But why argue with myself in this way,\nwhile Patroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned-\nhe Whom I can never forget so long as I am alive and my strength fails\nnot? Though men forget their dead when once they are within the house\nof Hades, yet not even there will I forget the comrade whom I have\nlost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory\nand go back to the ships taking this man along with us; for we have\nachieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to whom the\nTrojans prayed throughout their city as though he were a god.\"\n\nOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the\nsinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed\nthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the\nbody fast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground.\nThen when he had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself\nmounted, he lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth.\nThe dust rose from Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark\nhair flew all abroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on\nearth, for Jove had now delivered him into the hands of his foes to\ndo him outrage in his own land. \n\nThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His mother\ntore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as she\nlooked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and throughout\nthe city the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was as though\nthe whole of frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire. Hardly could\nthe people hold Priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates\nof the city. He grovelled in the mire and besought them, calling each\none of them by his name. \"Let be, my friends,\" he cried, \"and for\nall your sorrow, suffer me to go single-handed to the ships of the\nAchaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he\nwill respect the feeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on\nmy old age. His own father is even such another as myself- Peleus,\nwho bred him and reared him to- be the bane of us Trojans, and of\nmyself more than of all others. Many a son of mine has he slain in\nthe flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as I may, I do\nso for one- Hector- more than for them all, and the bitterness of\nmy sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades. Would that he\nhad died in my arms, for so both his ill-starred mother who bore him,\nand myself, should have had the comfort of weeping and mourning over\nhim.\" \n\nThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city\njoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among\nthe Trojans. \"Alas, my son,\" she cried, \"what have I left to live\nfor now that you are no more? Night and day did I glory in. you throughout\nthe city, for you were a tower of strength to all in Troy, and both\nmen and women alike hailed you as a god. So long as you lived you\nwere their pride, but now death and destruction have fallen upon you.\"\n\nHector's wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to tell\nher that her husband had remained without the gates. She was at her\nloom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and\nembroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a large\ntripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector when\nhe came out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond\nthe reach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by the hands\nof Achilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and trembled\nin every limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke\nto her waiting-women. \"Two of you,\" she said, \"come with me that I\nmay learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my husband's\nhonoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would come into my\nmouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune for Priam's\nchildren must be at hand. May I never live to hear it, but I greatly\nfear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hector and has\nchased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he may\nhave put an end to the reckless daring which possessed my husband,\nwho would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on\nfar in front, foremost of them all in valour.\" \n\nHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like\na maniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached\nthe battlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon\nthe wall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city- the\nhorses dragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the\nships of the Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness\nof night and she fell fainting backwards. She tore the tiring from\nher head and flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited\nband, and the veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when\nHector took her with him from the house of Eetion, after having given\ncountless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband's sisters and\nthe wives of his brothers crowded round her and supported her, for\nshe was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presently breathed\nand came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans\nsaying, 'Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common\nlot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes\nunder the wooded mountain of Placus in the house of Eetion who brought\nme up when I was a child- ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter-\nwould that he had never begotten me. You are now going into the house\nof Hades under the secret places of the earth, and you leave me a\nsorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom you and I are the\nunhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that you are gone, O\nHector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you. Even though he\nescape the horrors of this woful war with the Achaeans, yet shall\nhis life henceforth be one of labour and sorrow, for others will seize\nhis lands. The day that robs a child of his parents severs him from\nhis own kind; his head is bowed, his cheeks are wet with tears, and\nhe will go about destitute among the friends of his father, plucking\none by the cloak and another by the shirt. Some one or other of these\nmay so far pity him as to hold the cup for a moment towards him and\nlet him moisten his lips, but he must not drink enough to wet the\nroof of his mouth; then one whose parents are alive will drive him\nfrom the table with blows and angry words. 'Out with you,' he will\nsay, 'you have no father here,' and the child will go crying back\nto his widowed mother- he, Astyanax, who erewhile would sit upon his\nfather's knees, and have none but the daintiest and choicest morsels\nset before him. When he had played till he was tired and went to sleep,\nhe would lie in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, on a soft couch,\nknowing neither want nor care, whereas now that he has lost his father\nhis lot will be full of hardship- he, whom the Trojans name Astyanax,\nbecause you, O Hector, were the only defence of their gates and battlements.\nThe wriggling writhing worms will now eat you at the ships, far from\nyour parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves upon you. You\nwill lie naked, although in your house you have fine and goodly raiment\nmade by hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of no use to you,\nfor you can never again wear it, and thus you will have respect shown\nyou by the Trojans both men and women.\" \n\nIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined\nin her lament. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XXIII\n\nThus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the Achaeans\nwhen they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his own ship.\nBut Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave\ncomrades saying, \"Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends,\nnot yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw\nnear to the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honour to the dead. When\nwe have had full comfort of lamentation we will unyoke our horses\nand take supper all of us here.\" \n\nOn this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them\nin their lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing\nround the body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning.\nThe sands of the seashore and the men's armour were wet with their\nweeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. Chief\nin all their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained\nhand on the breast of his friend. \"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus,\neven in the house of Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised\nyou; I will drag Hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve\nnoble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge\nyou.\" \n\nAs he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely, laying\nit at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. The others\nthen put off every man his armour, took the horses from their chariots,\nand seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the fleet\ndescendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an abundant funeral\nbanquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did\nthey butcher and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed,\ndid they singe and set to roast in the flames of Vulcan; and rivulets\nof blood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.\n\nThen the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to Agamemnon,\nbut hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so wroth was\nhe for the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon's\ntent they told the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire\nin case they might persuade the son of Peleus 'to wash the clotted\ngore from this body, but he denied them sternly, and swore it with\na solemn oath, saying, \"Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiest of\nall gods, it is not meet that water should touch my body, till I have\nlaid Patroclus on the flames, have built him a barrow, and shaved\nmy head- for so long as I live no such second sorrow shall ever draw\nnigh me. Now, therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands,\nbut at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and\nprovide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm of darkness;\nthe fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the sooner, and the\npeople shall turn again to their own labours.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste\nto prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so\nthat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had had enough to eat\nand drink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but\nthe son of Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of\nthe sounding sea, in an open place where the waves came surging in\none after another. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and\neased the burden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing\nHector round windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew\nnear him, like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of\nhis beaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit\nhovered over his head and said- \n\n\"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living,\nbut now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all\nspeed that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows\nof men that can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will\nnot yet suffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander\nall desolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now\nyour hand I pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire,\nnever shall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermore\nshall we sit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the cruel\nfate which was my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me-\nnay, you too Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the\nwall of the noble Trojans. \n\n\"One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not my\nbones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as we\nwere brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought\nme to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed\nthe son of Amphidamas- not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel\nover the dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated\nme kindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones\nlie in but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you\nby your mother.\" \n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Why, true heart, are you come hither to lay\nthese charges upon me? will of my own self do all as you have bidden\nme. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around one\nanother, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows.\"\n\nHe opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped\nhim in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a vapour,\ngibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet,\nsmote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, \"Of a truth even\nin the house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have no life\nin them; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus has hovered over\nhead making piteous moan, telling me what I am to do for him, and\nlooking wondrously like himself.\" \n\nThus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning\nabout the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then King\nAgamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring\nwood, and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them.\nThey went out with woodmen's axes and strong ropes in their hands,\nand before them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go,\nby straight ways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of\nmany-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a tall\nbranching oak that came thundering down as they felled it. They split\nthe trees and bound them behind the mules, which then wended their\nway as they best could through the thick brushwood on to the plain.\nAll who had been cutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire to\nIdomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a line upon\nthe seashore at the place where Achilles would make a mighty monument\nfor Patroclus and for himself. \n\nWhen they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole\nground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles ordered\nhis brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man\nhis horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted\neach his chariot- they and their charioteers with them. The chariots\nwent before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their\ntens of thousands after. In the midst of them his comrades bore Patroclus\nand covered him with the locks of their hair which they cut off and\nthrew upon his body. Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow,\nso noble a comrade was he taking to the house of Hades. \n\nWhen they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they laid\nthe body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought him of\nanother matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the\nyellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He looked\nall sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, \"Spercheius, in vain\ndid my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to my loved\nnative land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb;\nfifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your springs, where\nis your grove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did\nmy father vow, but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore,\nthat I shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to\nthe hero Patroclus.\" \n\nAs he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and\nall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun\nwould have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently\nsaid to Agamemnon, \"Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people\nwill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from mourning;\nbid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their dinners:\nwe, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is wanted here,\nand let the other princes also stay by me.\" \n\nWhen King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships,\nbut those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre\na hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfully\nupon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen\nbefore the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped\nthe body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all\nround it. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and\nunguents; four proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning\nthe while he did so. The dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them\ndid Achilles slay and threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave\nsons of noble Trojans to the sword and laid them with the rest, for\nhe was full of bitterness and fury. Then he committed all to the resistless\nand devouring might of the fire; he groaned aloud and callid on his\ndead comrade by name. \"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus, even in the\nhouse of Hades; I am now doing all that I have promised you. Twelve\nbrave sons of noble Trojans shall the flames consume along with yourself,\nbut dogs, not fire, shall devour the flesh of Hector son of Priam.\"\n\nThus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector,\nfor Jove's daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and anointed\nhim with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn when\nAchilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark\ncloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place where\nHector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.\n\nNow the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles therefore\nbethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the two\nwinds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He made them\nmany drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come\nand help him that the wood might make haste to kindle and the dead\nbodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and started off to\nfetch the winds. They were holding high feast in the house of boisterous\nZephyrus when Iris came running up to the stone threshold of the house\nand stood there, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came\ntowards her and each of them called her to him, but Iris would not\nsit down. \"I cannot stay,\" she said, \"I must go back to the streams\nof Oceanus and the land of the Ethiopians who are offering hecatombs\nto the immortals, and I would have my share; but Achilles prays that\nBoreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly\nofferings; he would have you blow upon the pyre of Patroclus for whom\nall the Achaeans are lamenting.\" \n\nWith this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent\nthe air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until\nthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when\nthey reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared\nunder the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard\nand beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his\ndouble cup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon\nthe spirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until\nthe earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the\nbones of his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his\nparents, even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his\ncomrade, pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.\n\nAt length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light which\nsaffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames\nfell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the\nThracian sea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son\nof Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with\ntoil, till he fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who were about\nthe son of Atreus drew near in a body, and roused him with the noise\nand tramp of their coming. He sat upright and said, \"Son of Atreus,\nand all other princes of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere\nupon the fire and quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroclus\nson of Menoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found,\nfor they lie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men and\nhorses, has been thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge. We\nwill lay the bones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against\nthe time when I shall myself go down into the house of Hades. As for\nthe barrow, labour not to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable.\nAfterwards, let those Achaeans who may be left at the ships when I\nam gone, build it both broad and high.\" \n\nThus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First\nthey poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the\nfire. With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their\nloved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat:\nthey then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the\ntent. They marked off the circle where the barrow should be, made\na foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth.\nWhen they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but Achilles\nstayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He brought prizes\nfrom the ships-cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women\nwith fair girdles, and swart iron. \n\nThe first prize he offered was for the chariot races- a woman skilled\nin all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears for\nhandles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man\nwho came in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken,\nand in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron that\nhad never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left\nthe maker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize was two\ntalents of gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by\nsmoke. Then he stood up and spoke among the Argives saying-\n\n\"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that\nlie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I\nshould carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know\nhow far my steeds excel all others- for they are immortal; Neptune\ngave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself;\nbut I shall hold aloof, I and my steeds that have lost their brave\nand kind driver, who many a time has washed them in clear water and\nanointed their manes with oil. See how they stand weeping here, with\ntheir manes trailing on the ground in the extremity of their sorrow.\nBut do you others set yourselves in order throughout the host, whosoever\nhas confidence in his horses and in the strength of his chariot.\"\n\nThus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred\nthemselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son\nof Admetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty\nDiomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken\nfrom Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him, yellow-haired\nMenelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses, Agamemnon's\nmare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The mare had been given to\nAgamemnon by echepolus son of Anchises, that he might not have to\nfollow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and take his ease; for\nJove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in spacious Sicyon.\nThis mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus put under the yoke.\n\nFourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus, made\nready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came up\nto him to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but\nlittle need. \"Antilochus,\" said Nestor, \"you are young, but Jove and\nNeptune have loved you well, and have made you an excellent horseman.\nI need not therefore say much by way of instruction. You are skilful\nat wheeling your horses round the post, but the horses themselves\nare very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your chances.\nThe other drivers know less than you do, but their horses are fleeter;\ntherefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice whereby\nyou may insure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers.\nThe woodman does more by skill than by brute force; by skill the pilot\nguides his storm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by skill one driver\ncan beat another. If a man go wide in rounding this way and that,\nwhereas a man who knows what he is doing may have worse horses, but\nhe will keep them well in hand when he sees the doubling-post; he\nknows the precise moment at which to pull the rein, and keeps his\neye well on the man in front of him. I will give you this certain\ntoken which cannot escape your notice. There is a stump of a dead\ntree-oak or pine as it may be- some six feet above the ground, and\nnot yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork of the road; it\nhas two white stones set one on each side, and there is a clear course\nall round it. It may have been a monument to some one long since dead,\nor it may have been used as a doubling-post in days gone by; now,\nhowever, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark round which\nthe chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, but as you stand\nin your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge on your right-hand\nhorse with voice and lash, and give him a loose rein, but let the\nleft-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave of your wheel shall\nalmost graze the post; but mind the stone, or you will wound your\nhorses and break your chariot in pieces, which would be sport for\nothers but confusion for yourself. Therefore, my dear son, mind well\nwhat you are about, for if you can be first to round the post there\nis no chance of any one giving you the goby later, not even though\nyou had Adrestus's horse Arion behind you horse which is of divine\nrace- or those of Laomedon, which are the noblest in this country.\"\n\nWhen Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in\nhis place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They\nthen all mounted their chariots and cast lots.- Achilles shook the\nhelmet, and the lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next\ncame that of King Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of\nAtreus and of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son\nof Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took their places\nin line; Achilles showed them the doubling-post round which they were\nto turn, some way off upon the plain; here he stationed his father's\nfollower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and report truly.\n\nAt the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck them\nwith the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. They flew\nfull speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from\nunder them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all\nflying in the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the\nground, and then again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood\nerect, and their hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of victory.\nEach kept calling on his horses, and the horses scoured the plain\namid the clouds of dust that they raised. \n\nIt was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way\nback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and\nit was seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres\nnow took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions\nof Diomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus's chariot, and\nhe could feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders,\nfor their heads were close to him as they flew over the course. Diomed\nwould have now passed him, or there would have been a dead heat, but\nPhoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip. Tears of anger\nfell from his eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than ever,\nwhile his own horses lost ground through his having no whip. Minerva\nsaw the trick which Apollo had played the son of Tydeus, so she brought\nhim his whip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went after\nthe son of Admetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him; the mares\nwent one to one side the course, and the other to the other, and the\npole was broken against the ground. Eumelus was thrown from his chariot\nclose to the wheel; his elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all torn,\nand his forehead was bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with\ntears and he could find no utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned\nhis horses aside and shot far ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength\ninto them and covered Diomed himself with glory. \n\nMenelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called\nto his father's horses. \"On with you both,\" he cried, \"and do your\nvery utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of\nTydeus, for Minerva has put running into them, and has covered Diomed\nwith glory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of Atreus\nand not be left behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. Why,\nmy good fellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shall surely\nbe- Nestor will keep neither of you, but will put both of you to the\nsword, if we win any the worse a prize through your carelessness,\nfly after them at your utmost speed; I will hit on a plan for passing\nthem in a narrow part of the way, and it shall not fail me.\"\n\nThey feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went\nquicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road had\nsunk. The ground was broken, for the winter's rain had gathered and\nhad worn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was\nmaking towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but\nAntilochus turned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little\non one side. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out, \"Antilochus,\nyou are driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow\nhere, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then; if you foul\nmy chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.\" \n\nBut Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had\nnot heard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young\nman can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his strength,\nand then Menelaus's mares drew behind, for he left off driving for\nfear the horses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus,\nwhile pressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong\nto the ground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus and said, \"There\nis no greater trickster living than you are; go, and bad luck go with\nyou; the Achaeans say not well that you have understanding, and come\nwhat may you shall not bear away the prize without sworn protest on\nmy part.\" \n\nThen he called on his horses and said to them, \"Keep your pace, and\nslacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner than\nyours, for they are neither of them young.\" \n\nThe horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so\nthat they were soon nearly up with the others. \n\nMeanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses\nwent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust. Idomeneus\ncaptain of the Cretans was first to make out the running, for he was\nnot in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commanding part\nof the ground. The driver was a long way off, but Idomeneus could\nhear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly-\na chestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on its forehead.\nHe stood up and said among the Argives, \"My friends, princes and counsellors\nof the Argives, can you see the running as well as I can? There seems\nto be another pair in front now, and another driver; those that led\noff at the start must have been disabled out on the plain. I saw them\nat first making their way round the doubling-post, but now, though\nI search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. Perhaps the reins\nfell from the driver's hand so that he lost command of his horses\nat the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he must have\nbeen thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his mares have\nleft the course and gone off wildly in a panic. Come up and see for\nyourselves, I cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems an\nAetolian by descent, ruler over the Argives, brave Diomed the son\nof Tydeus.\" \n\nAjax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, \"Idomeneus, why\nshould you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the mares\nare still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the youngest,\nnor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down\nthe law. You have no right to do so, for there are better men here\nthan you are. Eumelus's horses are in front now, as they always have\nbeen, and he is on the chariot holding the reins.\" \n\nThe captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, \"Ajax you are\nan excellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in\nmuch else as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a\ntripod or cauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose\nhorses are first. You will then know to your cost.\" \n\nAjax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there would\nhave been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles risen\nin his place and said, \"Cease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus; it\nis not you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like:\nsit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towards\nthe winning-post and will be bere directly. You will then both of\nyou know whose horses are first, and whose come after.\" \n\nAs he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his\nwhip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they\nflew over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver,\nand the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet\nhorses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and\nthe horses came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them\nin the middle of the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests\nfell in streams on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his goodly\nchariot, and leaned his whip against his horses' yoke; brave Sthenelus\nnow lost no time, but at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman\nand the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. Then he\nunyoked the horses. \n\nNext after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had passed\nMenelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even\nso Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse\nthat draws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse's\ntail touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much space between\nwheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus was no further\nthan this behind Antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc's\nthrow behind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon's\nmare Aethe kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course\nhad been longer he would have passed him, and there would not even\nhave been a dead heat. Idomeneus's brave squire Meriones was about\na spear's cast behind Menelaus. His horses were slowest of all, and\nhe was the worst driver. Last of them all came the son of Admetus,\ndragging his chariot and driving his horses on in front. When Achilles\nsaw him he was sorry, and stood up among the Argives saying, \"The\nbest man is coming in last. Let us give him a prize for it is reasonable.\nHe shall have the second, but the first must go to the son of Tydeus.\"\n\nThus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying,\nand were for doing as he had said, but Nestor's son Antilochus stood\nup and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. \"Achilles,\" said\nhe, \"I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob\nme of my prize, because you think Eumelus's chariot and horses were\nthrown out, and himself too, good man that he is. He should have prayed\nduly to the immortals; he would not have come in fast if he had done\nso. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in\nyour tents, with bronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something\nfrom this store if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you,\nand give him a better prize even than that which you have now offered;\nbut I will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her,\nlet him come on.\" \n\nAchilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus,\nwho was one of his dearest comrades. So he said- \n\n\"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will\ngive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round\nit which I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him.\"\n\nHe bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent,\nand he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received\nit gladly. \n\nBut Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An\nattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep\nsilence: the hero then addressed them. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"what\nis this from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me\ncut a poor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front\nof them, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O princes\nand counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show no favour,\nlest one of the Achaeans say, 'Menelaus has got the mare through lying\nand corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilochus's, but\nhe has greater weight and influence.' Nay, I will determine the matter\nmyself, and no man will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come\nhere, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before\nyour chariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by\nearth-encircling Neptune that you did not purposely and guilefully\nget in the way of my horses.\" \n\nAnd Antilochus answered, \"Forgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaus,\nthan you are; you stand higher than I do and are the better man of\nthe two; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion;\ntheir tempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make due\nallowances therefore, and bear with me; I will of my own accord give\nup the mare that I have won, and if you claim any further chattel\nfrom my own possessions, I would rather yield it to you, at once,\nthan fall from your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the sight\nof heaven.\" \n\nThe son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaus,\nwhose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field of ripening\ncorn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest- even so, O Menelaus,\nwas your heart made glad within you. He turned to Antilochus and said,\n\"Now, Antilochus, angry though I have been, I can give way to you\nof my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor ill-disposed\nhitherto, but this time your youth has got the better of your judgement;\nbe careful how you outwit your betters in future; no one else could\nhave brought me round so easily, but your good father, your brother,\nand yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my behalf; I\ntherefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare to you,\nmine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that I am neither\nharsh nor vindictive.\" \n\nWith this he gave the mare over to Antilochus's comrade Noemon, and\nthen took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth, carried\noff the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled\nurn, being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him\namong the assembled Argives and saying, \"Take this, my good old friend,\nas an heirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus- for you shall\nsee him no more among the Argives. I give you this prize though you\ncannot win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot\nenter for the javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has\nbeen laid heavily upon you.\" \n\nSo saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and\nanswered, \"My son, all that you have said is true; there is no strength\nnow in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from either\nshoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as when the Epeans\nwere burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons offered prizes\nin his honour. There was then none that could vie with me neither\nof the Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing\nI overcame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron\nwho had come forward against me. Iphiclus was a good runner, but I\nbeat him, and threw farther with my spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus.\nIn chariot-racing alone did the two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding\ntheir horses in front of me, for they were angry at the way victory\nhad gone, and at the greater part of the prizes remaining in the place\nin which they had been offered. They were twins, and the one kept\non holding the reins, and holding the reins, while the other plied\nthe whip. Such was I then, but now I must leave these matters to younger\nmen; I must bow before the weight of years, but in those days I was\neminent among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests\nin honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart\nrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill\ntowards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all\nwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance.\"\n\nThereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks\nof Nestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and presently\noffered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He brought\nout a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the crowd- a\nshe-mule never yet broken, but six years old- when it is hardest of\nall to break them: this was for the victor, and for the vanquished\nhe offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said among the Argives,\n\"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite our two champion\nboxers to lay about them lustily and compete for these prizes. He\nto whom Apollo vouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom the Achaeans\nacknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back with him to his own\ntent, while he that is vanquished shall have the double cup.\"\n\nAs he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and great stature,\na skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand on the mule\nand said, \"Let the man who is to have the cup come hither, for none\nbut myself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all here present,\nand none can beat me. Is it not enough that I should fall short of\nyou in actual fighting? Still, no man can be good at everything. I\ntell you plainly, and it shall come true; if any man will box with\nme I will bruise his body and break his bones; therefore let his friends\nstay here in a body and be at hand to take him away when I have done\nwith him.\" \n\nThey all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of Mecisteus,\nwho was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes after the fall\nof Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people of Cadmus.\nThe son of Tydeus was Euryalus's second, cheering him on and hoping\nheartily that he would win. First he put a waistband round him and\nthen he gave him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being\nnow girt went into the middle of the ring, and immediately fell to;\nheavily indeed did they punish one another and lay about them with\ntheir brawny fists. One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws,\nand they sweated from every pore of their skin. Presently Epeus came\non and gave Euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round; Euryalus\ncould not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a moment and he\nsprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the air near some shore\nthat is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the\nwaves, and then falls back into deep water. But noble Epeus caught\nhold of him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and\nled him from the ring, unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one\nside, and spitting great clots of gore. They set him down in a swoon\nand then went to fetch the double cup. \n\nThe son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest\nand showed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of\nwrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting\nupon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelve\noxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of\narts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the\nArgives, \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"\n\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty Ulysses,\nfull of wiles rose also. The two girded themselves and went into the\nmiddle of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong hands\nlike the rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof of\na high house to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as they\ntugged at one another with their mighty arms- and sweat rained from\nthem in torrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and\nshoulders, but they kept on striving with might and main for victory\nand to win the tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him;\nUlysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire\nof watching them, Ajax said to ulysses, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,\nyou shall either lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between\nus.\" \n\nHe lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not forget\nhis cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee, so that\nhe could not keep his feet, but fell on his back with Ulysses lying\nupon his chest, and all who saw it marvelled. Then Ulysses in turn\nlifted Ajax and stirred him a little from the ground but could not\nlift him right off it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side\nby side on the ground and were all begrimed with dust. They now sprang\ntowards one another and were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles\nrose and stayed them. \"Put not each other further,\" said he, \"to such\ncruel suffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you\nan equal prize, and let the other Achaeans now compete.\"\n\nThus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their\nshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.\n\nThe son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running- a mixing-bowl\nbeautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six measures, and\nfar exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; it was the\nwork of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been brought into port\nby Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present of it to\nThoas. Eueneus son of jason had given it to Patroclus in ransom of\nPriam's son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prize in honour\nof his comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. For the second\nprize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for the last there\nwas to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said among the Argives,\n\"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\" \n\nForthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, and\nNestor's son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of\nhis time. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal.\nThe course was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son\nof Oileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him\nas the shuttle is to a woman's bosom when she throws the woof across\nthe warp and holds it close up to her; even so close behind him was\nUlysses- treading in his footprints before the dust could settle there,\nand Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as he ran swiftly\non. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straining his\nutmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were now\nnearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to Minerva.\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"and help my feet, O goddess.\" Thus did he pray,\nand Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet\nfeel light, and when the runners were at the point of pouncing upon\nthe prize, Ajax, through Minerva's spite slipped upon some offal that\nwas lying there from the cattle which Achilles had slaughtered in\nhonour of Patroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with\ncow dung. Ulysses therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got\nbefore Ajax and came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with\nhis hand on one of its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth.\nThen he said to the Argives, \"Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running;\nshe watches over Ulysses and stands by him as though she were his\nown mother.\" Thus did he speak and they all of them laughed heartily.\n\nAntilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the\nbystanders, \"You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown\ntheir respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and\nas for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale\nin spite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against\nhim save only Achilles.\" \n\nHe said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and Achilles\nanswered, \"Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no purpose;\nI shall give you an additional half talent of gold.\" He then gave\nthe half talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly. \n\nThen the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that\nhad been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus.\nHe stood up and said among the Argives, \"We bid two champions put\non their armour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another\nin the presence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound\nthe flesh of the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to\nhim will I give this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which\nI took from Asteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership,\nand I will give each of them a hearty meal in my own tent.\"\n\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty Diomed\nson of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his own side\nof the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and with\nfire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled as they beheld\nthem, and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice\ndid they spring forward and thrice try to strike each other in close\ncombat. Ajax pierced Diomed's round shield, but did not draw blood,\nfor the cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son\nof Tydeus from over his huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax's\nneck with the point of his spear, and the Achaeans alarmed for his\nsafety bade them leave off fighting and divide the prize between them.\nAchilles then gave the great sword to the son of Tydeus, with its\nscabbard, and the leathern belt with which to hang it. \n\nAchilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had\nerewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carried\nit off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said\namong the Argives, \"Stand forward, you who would essay this contest.\nHe who wins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years\nas they go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town\nhis shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron,\nfor he will have a stock of it on his own premises.\" \n\nThen uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax\nson of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other\nand Epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which\nset all the Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race\nof Mars. Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond\nany mark that had been made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the\nquoit he hurled it as though it had been a stockman's stick which\nhe sends flying about among his cattle when he is driving them, so\nfar did his throw out-distance those of the others. All who saw it\nroared applause, and his comrades carried the prize for him and set\nit on board his ship. \n\nAchilles next offered a prize of iron for archery- ten double-edged\naxes and ten with single eddies: he set up a ship's mast, some way\noff upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by\nthe foot; this was what they were to aim at. \"Whoever,\" he said, \"can\nhit the pigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with him;\nhe who hits the string without hitting the bird will have taken a\nworse aim and shall have the single-edged axes.\" \n\nThen uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of Idomeneus\nrose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of Teucer\nfell first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promise\nhecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and missed his bird,\nfor Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird\nwas tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so\nthat it hung down towards the ground, while the bird flew up into\nthe sky, and the Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who had his\narrow ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand,\nand at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling\nlambs to Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under\nthe clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling\nupwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in\nthe ground at Meriones' feet, but the bird perched on the ship's mast\nhanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went\nout of her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore,\ntook all ten double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged\nones to his ships. \n\nThen the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had\nnever been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a\npattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up- to\nwit the son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart\nsquire of Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, \"Son of Atreus, we\nknow how far you excel all others both in power and in throwing the\njavelin; take the cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it\nso please you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this at least is\nwhat I should myself wish.\" \n\nKing Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones,\nand handed the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XXIV\n\nThe assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to\nhis own ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethought\nthem of the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept for thinking\nof his dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow, could\ntake no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn as he yearned\nafter the might and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of all they\nhad done together, and all they had gone through both on the field\nof battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on these\nthings he wept bitterly and lay now on his side, now on his back,\nand now face downwards, till at last he rose and went out as one distraught\nto wander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawn breaking over\nbeach and sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, and bound the body\nof Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice did he drag\nit round the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went back into\nhis tent, leaving the body on the ground full length and with its\nface downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured, for\nhe pitied the man, dead though he now was; therefore he shielded him\nwith his golden aegis continually, that he might take no hurt while\nAchilles was dragging him. \n\nThus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but the\nblessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury, slayer\nof Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save only Juno,\nNeptune, and Jove's grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the hate\nwhich they had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and his people;\nfor they forgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus in disdaining\nthe goddesses who came to him when he was in his sheepyards, and preferring\nher who had offered him a wanton to his ruin. \n\nWhen, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come, Phoebus\nApollo spoke among the immortals saying, \"You gods ought to be ashamed\nof yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not Hector burn\nyou thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And now dare\nyou not rescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon, with\nhis mother and child, his father Priam, and his people, who would\nforthwith commit him to the flames, and give him his due funeral rites?\nSo, then, you would all be on the side of mad Achilles, who knows\nneither right nor ruth? He is like some savage lion that in the pride\nof his great strength and daring springs upon men's flocks and gorges\non them. Even so has Achilles flung aside all pity, and all that conscience\nwhich at once so greatly banes yet greatly boons him that will heed\nit. man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost- a son, it\nmay be, or a brother born from his own mother's womb; yet when he\nhas mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes\nmuch sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has slain\nnoble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb of his comrade.\nIt were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so, for\nbrave though he be we gods may take it ill that he should vent his\nfury upon dead clay.\" \n\nJuno spoke up in a rage. \"This were well,\" she cried, \"O lord of the\nsilver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles;\nbut Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman's breast, whereas Achilles\nis the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared and brought up.\nI married her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to the immortals;\nyou gods came all of you to her wedding; you feasted along with them\nyourself and brought your lyre- false, and fond of low company, that\nyou have ever been.\" \n\nThen said Jove, \"Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not be\nequal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods,\nas also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was my\naltar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour of\nsacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body\nof mighty Hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without\nAchilles coming to know it, for his mother keeps night and day beside\nhim. Let some one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and I will\nimpart my counsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept a ransom\nfrom Priam, and give up the body.\" \n\nOn this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Down\nshe plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus;\nthe waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the bottom\nas the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry death\nto fishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with the other\nsea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midst of them\nweeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his own land, on\nthe rich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said, \"Rise Thetis;\nJove, whose counsels fail not, bids you come to him.\" And Thetis answered,\n\"Why does the mighty god so bid me? I am in great grief, and shrink\nfrom going in and out among the immortals. Still, I will go, and the\nword that he may speak shall not be spoken in vain.\" \n\nThe goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe more\nsombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her.\nThe waves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the\nshore they flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing\nson of Saturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near\nhim. Minerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side\nof father Jove. Juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and\nspoke to her in words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her\nback the cup; and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\n\n\"So, goddess,\" said he, \"for all your sorrow, and the grief that I\nwell know reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to Olympus,\nand I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days past the\nimmortals have been quarrelling about Achilles waster of cities and\nthe body of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer of Argus steal\nthe body, but in furtherance of our peace and amity henceforward,\nI will concede such honour to your son as I will now tell you. Go,\nthen, to the host and lay these commands upon him; say that the gods\nare angry with him, and that I am myself more angry than them all,\nin that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not give him up. He\nmay thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time I will send\nIris to great Priam to bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans, and\nransom his son, taking with him such gifts for Achilles as may give\nhim satisfaction. \n\nSilver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith down\nshe darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to her son's\ntents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty comrades\nround him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which they had\nkilled a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside him and caressed\nhim with her hand saying, \"My son, how long will you keep on thus\ngrieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart, and think\nneither of food nor of woman's embraces; and yet these too were well,\nfor you have no long time to live, and death with the strong hand\nof fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heed what I\nsay, for I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods are\nangry with you, and himself more angry than them all, in that you\nkeep Hector at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let him\ngo, and accept a ransom for his body.\" \n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion\nthus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away.\"\n\nThus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse\nwith one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to the strong\ncity of Ilius. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, from the mansions of Olympus,\nand tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships of the\nAchaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take such gifts\nwith him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he is to go alone,\nwith no other Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may drive\nhis mules and waggon, and bring back the body of him whom noble Achilles\nhas slain. Let him have no thought nor fear of death in his heart,\nfor we will send the slayer of Argus to escort him, and bring him\nwithin the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill him nor let another\ndo so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he will\nentreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\" \n\nOn this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message.\nShe went to Priam's house, and found weeping and lamentation therein.\nHis sons were seated round their father in the outer courtyard, and\ntheir raiment was wet with tears: the old man sat in the midst of\nthem with his mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and\nneck all covered with the filth which he had clutched as he lay grovelling\nin the mire. His daughters and his sons' wives went wailing about\nthe house, as they thought of the many and brave men who lay dead,\nslain by the Argives. The messenger of Jove stood by Priam and spoke\nsoftly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so. \"Take heart,\"\nshe said, \"Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and fear not. I\nbring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards you. I come as a\nmessenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takes thought for\nyou and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom noble\nHector, and take with you such gifts as shall give satisfaction to\nAchilles. You are to go alone, with no Trojan, save only some honoured\nservant who may drive your mules and waggon, and bring back to the\ncity the body of him whom noble Achilles has slain. You are to have\nno thought, nor fear of death, for Jove will send the slayer of Argus\nto escort you. When he has brought you within Achilles' tent, Achilles\nwill not kill you nor let another do so, for he will take heed to\nhis ways and sin not, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable\ncourtesy.\" \n\nIris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his sons\nto get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon fast\nupon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant store-room,\nhigh-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many treasures were\nkept, and he called Hecuba his wife. \"Wife,\" said he, \"a messenger\nhas come to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to the ships of\nthe Achaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts as shall\ngive satisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter? for\nmy own part I am greatly moved to pass through the of the Achaeans\nand go to their ships.\" \n\nHis wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, \"Alas, what has become\nof that judgement for which you have been ever famous both among strangers\nand your own people? How can you venture alone to the ships of the\nAchaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many of your\nbrave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the cruel savage sees\nyou and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity. Let\nus then weep Hector from afar here in our own house, for when I gave\nhim birth the threads of overruling fate were spun for him that dogs\nshould eat his flesh far from his parents, in the house of that terrible\nman on whose liver I would fain fasten and devour it. Thus would I\navenge my son, who showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him, and\nthought neither of Right nor of avoiding battle as he stood in defence\nof Trojan men and Trojan women.\" \n\nThen Priam said, \"I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a\nbird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it been\nsome mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines\nfrom sacrifice- I should have deemed him false and have given him\nno heed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to face,\ntherefore I will go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be\nmy fate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it;\nlet Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my son in my arms\nand mourned him to my heart's comforting.\" \n\nSo saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve goodly\nvestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs,\ntwelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed out\nten talents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods, four\ncauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given\nhim when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious,\nbut he grudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of\nhis son. Then he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebuked\nthem with words of anger. \"Out,\" he cried, \"shame and disgrace to\nme that you are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are\ncome to plague me here? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son\nof Saturn has sent this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my\nsons? Nay, you shall prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans\nwill have easier work in killing you. As for me, let me go down within\nthe house of Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of\nthe city.\" \n\nHe drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old\nman sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus, Paris,\nnoble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud battle-cry,\nDeiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the old man call near\nhim. \"Come to me at once,\" he cried, \"worthless sons who do me shame;\nwould that you had all been killed at the ships rather than Hector.\nMiserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons in all Troy-\nnoble Nestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hector who was\na god among men, so that one would have thought he was son to an immortal-\nyet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain them and those of\nwhom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light of foot, heroes\nof the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own people, why\ndo you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and put all these things\nupon it that I may set out on my way?\" \n\nThus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. They\nbrought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of\nthe waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on\nwhich it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and\nrings for the reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band eleven\ncubits long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the\nfar end of the pole, and put the ring over the upright pin making\nit fast with three turns of the band on either side the knob, and\nbending the thong of the yoke beneath it. This done, they brought\nfrom the store-chamber the rich ransom that was to purchase the body\nof Hector, and they set it all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked\nthe strong harness-mules which the Mysians had on a time given as\na goodly present to Priam; but for Priam himself they yoked horses\nwhich the old king had bred, and kept for own use. \n\nThus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of their\ncars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with a\ngolden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a drink-offering\nbefore they set out. She stood in front of the horses and said, \"Take\nthis, make a drink-offering to father Jove, and since you are minded\nto go to the ships in spite of me, pray that you may come safely back\nfrom the hands of your enemies. Pray to the son of Saturn lord of\nthe whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks down over all Troy, pray\nhim to send his swift messenger on your right hand, the bird of omen\nwhich is strongest and most dear to him of all birds, that you may\nsee it with your own eyes and trust it as you go forth to the ships\nof the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will not send you this messenger,\nhowever set upon it you may be, I would not have you go to the ships\nof the Argives.\" \n\nAnd Priam answered, \"Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well\nto lift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me.\"\n\nWith this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over\nhis hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He washed\nhis hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offering\nand prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his\neyes to heaven. \"Father Jove,\" he said, \"that rulest from Ida, most\nglorious and most great, grant that I may be received kindly and compassionately\nin the tents of Achilles; and send your swift messenger upon my right\nhand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to you of\nall birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as I go\nforth to the ships of the Danaans.\" \n\nSo did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer. Forthwith\nhe sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds that fly,\nthe dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings were\nspread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and well-bolted\ndoor of a rich man's chamber. He came to them flying over the city\nupon their right hands, and when they saw him they were glad and their\nhearts took comfort within them. The old man made haste to mount his\nchariot, and drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing\ngatehouse of the outer court. Before him went the mules drawing the\nfour-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise Idaeus; behind these were\nthe horses, which the old man lashed with his whip and drove swiftly\nthrough the city, while his friends followed after, wailing and lamenting\nfor him as though he were on his road to death. As soon as they had\ncome down from the city and had reached the plain, his sons and sons-in-law\nwho had followed him went back to Ilius. \n\nBut Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not escape\nthe ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old man and pitied\nhim; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, \"Mercury, for it is\nyou who are the most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear\nthose whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to the ships of\nthe Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him nor take note\nof him until he reach the son of Peleus.\" \n\nThus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did\nas he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals\nwith which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he took the\nwand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as\nhe pleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to Troy and\nto the Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of noble birth\nin the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon\nhis face. \n\nNow when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius,\nthey stayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river,\nfor the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw\nMercury standing near them he said to Priam, \"Take heed, descendant\nof Dardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a man\nwho I think will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses,\nor at least embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion upon\nus? \n\nWhen he heard this the old man's heart failed him, and he was in great\nfear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on end\nover his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and\ntook him by the hand, saying, \"Whither, father, are you thus driving\nyour mules and horses in the dead of night when other men are asleep?\nAre you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard by you, so\ncruel and relentless? Should some one of them see you bearing so much\ntreasure through the darkness of the flying night, what would not\nyour state then be? You are no longer young, and he who is with you\nis too old to protect you from those who would attack you. For myself,\nI will do you no harm, and I will defend you from any one else, for\nyou remind me of my own father.\" \n\nAnd Priam answered, \"It is indeed as you say, my dear son; nevertheless\nsome god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent such a wayfarer\nas yourself to meet me so Opportunely; you are so comely in mien and\nfigure, and your judgement is so excellent that you must come of blessed\nparents.\" \n\nThen said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, all that\nyou have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking\nthis rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be\nsafe, or are you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that your\nson has fallen who was the bravest man among you and was never lacking\nin battle with the Achaeans?\" \n\nAnd Priam said, \"Wo are you, my friend, and who are your parents,\nthat you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?\"\n\nThe slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, \"Sir, you would\nprove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a time have\nI set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives to their\nships and putting them to the sword. We stood still and marvelled,\nfor Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered us not to\nfight. I am his squire, and came with him in the same ship. I am a\nMyrmidon, and my father's name is Polyctor: he is a rich man and about\nas old as you are; he has six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh.\nWe cast lots, and it fell upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I\nam now come from the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the\nAchaeans will set battle in array about the city. They chafe at doing\nnothing, and are so eager that their princes cannot hold them back.\"\n\nThen answered Priam, \"If you are indeed the squire of Achilles son\nof Peleus, tell me now the Whole truth. Is my son still at the ships,\nor has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his hounds?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"neither hounds\nnor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at the\ntents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days that\nhe has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms eaten\nhim although they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags him\ncruelly round the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him no\nhurt. You should come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew, with\nthe blood all washed away, and his wounds every one of them closed\nthough many pierced him with their spears. Such care have the blessed\ngods taken of your brave son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure.\"\n\nThe old man was comforted as he heard him and said, \"My son, see what\na good thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals; for\nas sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold\nOlympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accept therefore\nat my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with heaven's help guide\nme till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus.\" \n\nThen answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, you are\ntempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me,\nfor you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles\nwhom I fear and hold it great guiltless to defraud, lest some evil\npresently befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to\nArgos itself, and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land,\nthat no one should attack you through making light of him who was\nwith you.\" \n\nThe bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing\nthe whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses.\nWhen they reached the trench and the wall that was before the ships,\nthose who were on guard had just been getting their suppers, and the\nslayer of Argus threw them all into a deep sleep. Then he drew back\nthe bolts to open the gates, and took Priam inside with the treasure\nhe had upon his waggon. Ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of\nthe son of Peleus for which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they\nhad built for their king; when they had built it they thatched it\nwith coarse tussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain, and\nall round it they made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes\nset close together. The gate was barred with a single bolt of pine\nwhich it took three men to force into its place, and three to draw\nback so as to open the gate, but Achilles could draw it by himself.\nMercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought in the treasure\nthat he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Then he sprang\nfrom the chariot on to the ground and said, \"Sir, it is I, immortal\nMercury, that am come with you, for my father sent me to escort you.\nI will now leave you, and will not enter into the presence of Achilles,\nfor it might anger him that a god should befriend mortal men thus\nopenly. Go you within, and embrace the knees of the son of Peleus:\nbeseech him by his father, his lovely mother, and his son; thus you\nmay move him.\" \n\nWith these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang from\nhis chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in charge\nof the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house\nwhere Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him\nwith his men seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero Automedon,\nand Alcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance about his\nperson, for he had but just done eating and drinking, and the table\nwas still there. King Priam entered without their seeing him, and\ngoing right up to Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed the dread\nmurderous hands that had slain so many of his sons. \n\nAs when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have killed\nsome one in his own country, and must fly to a great man's protection\nin a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so did Achilles\nmarvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one to another and marvelled\nalso, but Priam besought Achilles saying, \"Think of your father, O\nAchilles like unto the gods, who is such even as I am, on the sad\nthreshold of old age. It may be that those who dwell near him harass\nhim, and there is none to keep war and ruin from him. Yet when he\nhears of you being still alive, he is glad, and his days are full\nof hope that he shall see his dear son come home to him from Troy;\nbut I, wretched man that I am, had the bravest in all Troy for my\nsons, and there is not one of them left. I had fifty sons when the\nAchaeans came here; nineteen of them were from a single womb, and\nthe others were borne to me by the women of my household. The greater\npart of them has fierce Mars laid low, and Hector, him who was alone\nleft, him who was the guardian of the city and ourselves, him have\nyou lately slain; therefore I am now come to the ships of the Achaeans\nto ransom his body from you with a great ransom. Fear, O Achilles,\nthe wrath of heaven; think on your own father and have compassion\nupon me, who am the more pitiable, for I have steeled myself as no\nman yet has ever steeled himself before me, and have raised to my\nlips the hand of him who slew my son.\" \n\nThus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he bethought\nhim of his father. He took the old man's hand and moved him gently\naway. The two wept bitterly- Priam, as he lay at Achilles' feet, weeping\nfor Hector, and Achilles now for his father and now for Patroclous,\ntill the house was filled with their lamentation. But when Achilles\nwas now sated with grief and had unburthened the bitterness of his\nsorrow, he left his seat and raised the old man by the hand, in pity\nfor his white hair and beard; then he said, \"Unhappy man, you have\nindeed been greatly daring; how could you venture to come alone to\nthe ships of the Achaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain\nso many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon\nthis seat, and for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts,\nfor weeping will not avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the\nlot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Jove's palace\nthere stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other\nwith good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts\nhe sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he\nto whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger\nof scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world,\nand he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither\nby gods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus; the gods endowed him\nwith all good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over the\nMyrmidons excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortal though\nhe was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him too\ndid heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal children\nborn to him in his house, save one son who is doomed to die all untimely;\nnor may I take care of him now that he is growing old, for I must\nstay here at Troy to be the bane of you and your children. And you\ntoo, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy. They say\nthat in wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed all that is\nin Lesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia that is more\ninland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from the\nday when the dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and slaughter\nhave been about your city continually. Bear up against it, and let\nthere be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may for your\nbrave son, you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him from\nthe dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall you.\"\n\nAnd Priam answered, \"O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector is\nstill lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransom\nwhich I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may look\nupon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land\nin safety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look upon\nthe light of the sun.\" \n\nAchilles looked at him sternly and said, \"Vex me, sir, no longer;\nI am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother, daughter\nof the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid me deliver\nit to you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannot hide it,\nthat some god has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans, for else,\nno man however strong and in his prime would dare to come to our host;\nhe could neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of my gates\nthus easily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sin against\nthe word of Jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though you are, within\nmy tents.\" \n\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang like\na lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with him went\nhis two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him than\nany others of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. These unyoked\nthe horses and mules, and bade Priam's herald and attendant be seated\nwithin the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector's body from the\nwaggon. but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, that Achilles\nmight wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home. Then\nhe called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint\nit, but he first took it to a place where Priam should not see it,\nlest if he did so, he should break out in the bitterness of his grief,\nand enrage Achilles, who might then kill him and sin against the word\nof Jove. When the servants had washed the body and anointed it, and\nhad wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles himself lifted\nit on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the waggon. He\ncried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade,\n\"Be not angry with me, Patroclus,\" he said, \"if you hear even in the\nhouse of Hades that I have given Hector to his father for a ransom.\nIt has been no unworthy one, and I will share it equitably with you.\"\n\nAchilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the richly\ninlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at right\nangles to the one against which Priam was sitting. \"Sir,\" he said,\n\"your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according to desire;\nyou shall look upon him when you him away at daybreak; for the present\nlet us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think about eating,\nthough her twelve children- six daughters and six lusty sons- had\nbeen all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sons with arrows from\nhis silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew the daughters, because\nNiobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said Leto had borne two\nchildren only, whereas she had herself borne many- whereon the two\nkilled the many. Nine days did they lie weltering, and there was none\nto bury them, for the son of Saturn turned the people into stone;\nbut on the tenth day the gods in heaven themselves buried them, and\nNiobe then took food, being worn out with weeping. They say that somewhere\namong the rocks on the mountain pastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs\nlive that haunt the river Achelous, there, they say, she lives in\nstone and still nurses the sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven.\nTherefore, noble sir, let us two now take food; you can weep for your\ndear son hereafter as you are bearing him back to Ilius- and many\na tear will he cost you.\" \n\nWith this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silvery\nwhiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all in due order.\nThey cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them,\nand drew them off again when they were well roasted. Automedon brought\nbread in fair baskets and served it round the table, while Achilles\ndealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the good things that\nwere before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\nPriam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strength and beauty\nof Achilles for he was as a god to see, and Achilles marvelled at\nPriam as he listened to him and looked upon his noble presence. When\nthey had gazed their fill Priam spoke first. \"And now, O king,\" he\nsaid, \"take me to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed\nboon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closed from the day your\nhands took the life of my son; I have grovelled without ceasing in\nthe mire of my stable-yard, making moan and brooding over my countless\nsorrows. Now, moreover, I have eaten bread and drunk wine; hitherto\nI have tasted nothing.\" \n\nAs he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds\nin the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good red\nrugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks\nfor Priam and Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torch\nand got the two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughingly\nto Priam, \"Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of\nthose who in due course keep coming to advise with me should see you\nhere in the darkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon.\nThis might cause delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell me\nand tell me true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral\nrites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and\nrestrain the host.\" \n\nAnd Priam answered, \"Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble son\nwith all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. You\nknow how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch\nwood from the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days, therefore,\nwill we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day we will bury him\nand there shall be a public feast in his honour; on the eleventh we\nwill build a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth, if there be\nneed, we will fight.\" \n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"All, King Priam, shall be as you have said.\nI will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named.\"\n\nAs he spoke he laid his hand on the old man's right wrist, in token\nthat he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and his attendant\nsleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while Achilles lay\nin an inner room of the house, with fair Briseis by his side.\n\nAnd now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelong\nnight, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck, sleep could\ntake no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get King Priam\naway from the ships without his being seen by the strong force of\nsentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam's head and said, \"Sir,\nnow that Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear about\nsleeping in the thick of your foes. You have paid a great ransom,\nand have received the body of your son; were you still alive and a\nprisoner the sons whom you have left at home would have to give three\ntimes as much to free you; and so it would be if Agamemnon and the\nother Achaeans were to know of your being here.\" \n\nWhen he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.\nMercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly\nthrough the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to\nthe ford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury went\nback to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to break over\nall the land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the city lamenting\nand making moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. No one neither\nman nor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as golden Venus standing\non Pergamus, caught sight of her dear father in his chariot, and his\nservant that was the city's herald with him. Then she saw him that\nwas lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she\nwent about the city saying, \"Come hither Trojans, men and women, and\nlook on Hector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from battle\nwhen he was alive, look now on him that was the glory of our city\nand all our people.\" \n\nAt this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a sorrow\nhad possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he was bringing\nin the body. Hector's wife and his mother were the first to mourn\nhim: they flew towards the waggon and laid their hands upon his head,\nwhile the crowd stood weeping round them. They would have stayed before\nthe gates, weeping and lamenting the livelong day to the going down\nof the sun, had not Priam spoken to them from the chariot and said,\n\"Make way for the mules to pass you. Afterwards when I have taken\nthe body home you shall have your fill of weeping.\" \n\nOn this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon. When\nthey had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a bed and\nseated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women joined\nin the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them all Andromache\nled their wailing as she clasped the head of mighty Hector in her\nembrace. \"Husband,\" she cried, \"you have died young, and leave me\nin your house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starred parents is\nstill a mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood. Ere he can\ndo so our city will be razed and overthrown, for you who watched over\nit are no more- you who were its saviour, the guardian of our wives\nand children. Our women will be carried away captives to the ships,\nand I among them; while you, my child, who will be with me will be\nput to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be,\nsome Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, to\navenge some brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of them\nhave indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father's hand in\nbattle was no light one. Therefore do the people mourn him. You have\nleft, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents, and my own grief\nis greatest of all, for you did not stretch forth your arms and embrace\nme as you lay dying, nor say to me any words that might have lived\nwith me in my tears night and day for evermore.\" \n\nBitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.\nHecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. \"Hector,\" she cried,\n\"dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive the gods\nloved you well, and even in death they have not been utterly unmindful\nof you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, he would sell\nhim beyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos; and when he\nhad slain you too with his sword, many a time did he drag you round\nthe sepulchre of his comrade- though this could not give him life-\nyet here you lie all fresh as dew, and comely as one whom Apollo has\nslain with his painless shafts.\" \n\nThus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and then\nHelen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation. \"Hector,\"\nsaid she, \"dearest of all my brothers-in-law-for I am wife to Alexandrus\nwho brought me hither to Troy- would that I had died ere he did so-\ntwenty years are come and gone since I left my home and came from\nover the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult or unkindness\nfrom you. When another would chide with me, as it might be one of\nyour brothers or sisters or of your brothers' wives, or my mother-in-law-\nfor Priam was as kind to me as though he were my own father- you would\nrebuke and check them with words of gentleness and goodwill. Therefore\nmy tears flow both for you and for my unhappy self, for there is no\none else in Troy who is kind to me, but all shrink and shudder as\nthey go by me.\" \n\nShe wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round her\njoined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, \"Bring\nwood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the Argives,\nfor Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me his word\nthat they should not attack us until the morning of the twelfth day.\"\n\nForthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together before\nthe city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps wood, and on\nthe morning of the tenth day with many tears they took trave Hector\nforth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and set the\nfire thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingered dawn appeared\non the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre of\nmighty Hector. When they were got together, they first quenched the\nfire with wine wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and\ncomrades with many a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped\nthem in soft robes of purple, and laid them in a golden urn, which\nthey placed in a grave and covered over with large stones set close\ntogether. Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping guard\non every side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they had\nfinished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went back again\ninto the city, and being well assembled they held high feast in the\nhouse of Priam their king. \n\nThus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of horses.\n\nTHE END\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "odyssey": "The Odyssey\nBy Homer\n\n\nTranslated by Samuel Butler\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK I\n\nTell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide\nafter he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,\nand many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;\nmoreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life\nand bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save\nhis men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating\nthe cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from\never reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter\nof Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them. \n\nSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely\nhome except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his\nwife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got\nhim into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by,\nthere came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to\nIthaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his\ntroubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun\nto pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing\nand would not let him get home. \n\nNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's\nend, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East.\nHe had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was\nenjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house\nof Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that\nmoment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon's\nson Orestes; so he said to the other gods: \n\n\"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing\nbut their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to\nAgamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he\nknew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him\nnot to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure\nto take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury\ntold him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he\nhas paid for everything in full.\" \n\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served\nAegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did;\nbut Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my\nheart bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt\nisland, far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island\ncovered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess\nlives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom\nof the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth\nasunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,\nand keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget\nhis home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how\nhe may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take\nno heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate\nyou with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being\nso angry with him?\" \n\nAnd Jove said, \"My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget\nUlysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more\nliberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven?\nBear in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses\nfor having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus\nis son to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys;\ntherefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him\nby preventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together\nand see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified,\nfor if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.\"\n\nAnd Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then,\nthe gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send\nMercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up\nour minds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca,\nto put heart into Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to\ncall the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his\nmother Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep\nand oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if\nhe can hear anything about the return of his dear father- for this\nwill make people speak well of him.\" \n\nSo saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,\nwith which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped\nthe redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong,\nwherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her,\nand down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith\nshe was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as\na visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear\nin her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of\nthe oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in\nfront of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to\nwait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some\ncleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again,\nand some cutting up great quantities of meat. \n\nTelemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily\namong the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would\nsend them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again\nand be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among\nthem, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for\nhe was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance.\nHe took her right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear.\n\"Welcome,\" said he, \"to our house, and when you have partaken of food\nyou shall tell us what you have come for.\" \n\nHe led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were\nwithin he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a\nstrong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy\nfather, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which\nhe threw a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,\nand he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors,\nthat she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence,\nand that he might ask her more freely about his father. \n\nA maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer\nand poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and\nshe drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them\nbread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the\nhouse, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set\ncups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and\npoured it out for them. \n\nThen the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and\nseats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids\nwent round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with\nwine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that\nwere before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink\nthey wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments\nof a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled\nperforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began\nto sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers\nthat no man might hear. \n\n\"I hope, sir,\" said he, \"that you will not be offended with what I\nam going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it,\nand all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in\nsome wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were\nto see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs\nrather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he,\nalas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes\nsay that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see\nhim again. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and\nwhere you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner\nof ship you came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what\nnation they declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by\nland. Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to\nthis house, or have you been here in my father's time? In the old\ndays we had many visitors for my father went about much himself.\"\n\nAnd Minerva answered, \"I will tell you truly and particularly all\nabout it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians.\nI have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign\ntongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring\nback copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country\naway from the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the wooded mountain\nNeritum. Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell\nyou, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never\ncomes to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly,\nwith an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when\nhe comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me\nyour father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems\nthe gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on\nthe mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid\nocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his\nwill I am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak\nas it is borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will\nnot be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even\nthough he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting\nhome again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have\nsuch a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like\nhim about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set\nsail for Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since\nthat time we have never either of us seen the other.\" \n\n\"My mother,\" answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses, but\nit is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son\nto one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask\nme, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they\ntell me is my father.\" \n\nAnd Minerva said, \"There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while\nPenelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me\ntrue, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these\npeople? What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a\nwedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringing any provisions\nof his own? And the guests- how atrociously they are behaving; what\nriot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable\nperson who comes near them.\" \n\n\"Sir,\" said Telemachus, \"as regards your question, so long as my father\nwas here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their\ndispleasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more\nclosely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it\nbetter even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before\nTroy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting\nwere done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\nashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the\nstorm-winds have spirited him away we know not wither; he is gone\nwithout leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing\nbut dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss\nof my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind;\nfor the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland\nisland of Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself,\nare eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to\nmy mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not marry,\nnor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate,\nand before long will do so also with myself.\" \n\n\"Is that so?\" exclaimed Minerva, \"then you do indeed want Ulysses\nhome again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and\nif he is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking\nand making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally\nsuitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was\nthen coming from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows\nfrom Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would\nnot give him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very\nfond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will\nhave a short shrift and a sorry wedding. \n\n\"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,\nand take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge\nyou to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take\nmy advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your\ncase before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors\ntake themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind\nis set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will\nfind her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that\nso dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon\nyou to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men,\nand go in quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some\none may tell you something, or (and people often hear things in this\nway) some heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and\nask Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got\nhome last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive\nand on his way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will\nmake for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear\nof his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\nall due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry\nagain. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind\nhow, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own\nhouse. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard\nhow people are singing Orestes' praises for having killed his father's\nmurderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your\nmettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must\ngo back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep\nthem waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember\nwhat I have said to you.\" \n\n\"Sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"it has been very kind of you to talk\nto me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all\nyou tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but\nstay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself.\nI will then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing;\nI will give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsake such as\nonly dear friends give to one another.\" \n\nMinerva answered, \"Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way\nat once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it\ntill I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give\nme a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.\"\n\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had\ngiven Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about\nhis father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the\nstranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors\nwere sitting. \n\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as\nhe told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva\nhad laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his\nsong from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase,\nnot alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached\nthe suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the\nroof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. She\nheld a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.\n\n\"Phemius,\" she cried, \"you know many another feat of gods and heroes,\nsuch as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these,\nand let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale,\nfor it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband\nwhom I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all\nHellas and middle Argos.\" \n\n\"Mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"let the bard sing what he has a mind\nto; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they,\nwho makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to\nhis own good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated\nreturn of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs\nmost warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the\nonly man who never came back from Troy, but many another went down\nas well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your\ndaily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants;\nfor speech is man's matter, and mine above all others- for it is I\nwho am master here.\" \n\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying\nin her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,\nshe mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her\neyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters,\nand prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow. \n\nThen Telemachus spoke, \"Shameless,\" he cried, \"and insolent suitors,\nlet us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for\nit is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius\nhas; but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you\nformal notice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and\nturn about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist\nin spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with\nyou in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be\nno man to avenge you.\" \n\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the\nboldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, \"The\ngods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may\nJove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before\nyou.\" \n\nTelemachus answered, \"Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing,\nI will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think\nof for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches\nand honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men\nin Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among\nthem; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule\nthose whom Ulysses has won for me.\" \n\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, \"It rests with heaven to\ndecide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your\nown house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man\nin Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow,\nI want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from?\nOf what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you\nnews about the return of your father, or was he on business of his\nown? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that\nhe was gone in a moment before we could get to know him.\"\n\n\"My father is dead and gone,\" answered Telemachus, \"and even if some\nrumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed\nsometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings\nno heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief\nof the Taphians, an old friend of my father's.\" But in his heart he\nknew that it had been the goddess. \n\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening;\nbut when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each\nin his own abode. Telemachus's room was high up in a tower that looked\non to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and full of\nthought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor,\nwent before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes had bought\nher with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the worth\nof twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her in his household\nas he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed\nfor he feared his wife's resentment. She it was who now lighted Telemachus\nto his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women\nin the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened\nthe door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as he took off\nhis shirt he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it tidily up,\nand hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which she went\nout, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt home\nby means of the strap. But Telemachus as he lay covered with a woollen\nfleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage of the\ncounsel that Minerva had given him. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK II\n\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus\nrose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,\ngirded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like\nan immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people\nin assembly, so they called them and the people gathered thereon;\nthen, when they were got together, he went to the place of assembly\nspear in hand- not alone, for his two hounds went with him. Minerva\nendowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled\nat him as he went by, and when he took his place' in his father's\nseat even the oldest councillors made way for him. \n\nAegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience,\nthe first to speak His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius,\nland of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they\nwere all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him,\nHe had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father's\nland, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless\ntheir father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still\nweeping for him when he began his speech. \n\n\"Men of Ithaca,\" he said, \"hear my words. From the day Ulysses left\nus there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then\ncan it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene\nus? Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to\nwarn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?\nI am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him\nhis heart's desire.\" \n\nTelemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for\nhe was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of\nthe assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,\nturning to Aegyptius, \"Sir,\" said he, \"it is I, as you will shortly\nlearn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved.\nI have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn\nyou, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak.\nMy grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes\nwhich have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of\nmy excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and\nwas like a father to every one of you; the second is much more serious,\nand ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all\nthe chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against\nher will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius, asking him\nto choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for\nhis daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my father's house,\nsacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and\nnever giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink.\nNo estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward\noff harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I\nshall never all my days be as good a man as he was, still I would\nindeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such\ntreatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have\nrespect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion.\nFear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased\nand turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the beginning\nand the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and leave\nme singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father Ulysses did some\nwrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding\nand abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house\nand home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I\ncould then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you\nwith notices from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas\nnow I have no remedy.\" \n\nWith this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into\ntears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and\nno one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who\nspoke thus: \n\n\"Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw\nthe blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours, for\nshe is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four,\nshe has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one\nof us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she\nsays. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set up\na great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous\npiece of fine needlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed\ndead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait- for\nI would not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have\ncompleted a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against\nthe time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women\nof the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.'\n\n\"This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her\nworking on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick\nthe stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three\nyears and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was\nnow in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing\ntold us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she\nhad to finish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore,\nmake you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand-'Send\nyour mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her\nfather's choice'; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on\nplaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score\nof the accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is\nso clever. We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro,\nAlcmena, Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing\nto your mother, any one of them. It was not fair of her to treat us\nin that way, and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven\nhas now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your estate;\nand I do not see why she should change, for she gets all the honour\nand glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she. Understand, then,\nthat we will not go back to our lands, neither here nor elsewhere,\ntill she has made her choice and married some one or other of us.\"\n\nTelemachus answered, \"Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore\nme from my father's house? My father is abroad and we do not know\nwhether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay\nIcarius the large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending\nhis daughter back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me,\nbut heaven will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the\nhouse will calf on the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not\nbe a creditable thing to do, and I will have nothing to say to it.\nIf you choose to take offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere\nat one another's houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If,\non the other hand, you elect to persist in spunging upon one man,\nheaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you\nfall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you.\"\n\nAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, and\nthey flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own\nlordly flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly\nthey wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and\nglaring death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting\nfiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right\nover the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each\nother what an this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best\nprophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and\nin all honesty, saying: \n\n\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors,\nfor I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away\nmuch longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction,\nnot on them alone, but on many another of us who live in Ithaca. Let\nus then be wise in time, and put a stop to this wickedness before\nhe comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be better\nfor them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge; everything\nhas happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set out for\nTroy, and he with them. I said that after going through much hardship\nand losing all his men he should come home again in the twentieth\nyear and that no one would know him; and now all this is coming true.\"\n\nEurymachus son of Polybus then said, \"Go home, old man, and prophesy\nto your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these\nomens myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about\nin the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything.\nUlysses has died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead\nalong with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel\nto the anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose\nyou think he will give you something for your family, but I tell you-\nand it shall surely be- when an old man like you, who should know\nbetter, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the\nfirst place his young friend will only fare so much the worse- he\nwill take nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this- and in\nthe next, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you\nwill at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. As for\nTelemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother\nback to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with\nall the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till we shall\ngo on harassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither\nfor him, with all his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of\nyours. You may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate\nyou the more. We shall go back and continue to eat up Telemachus's\nestate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves off\ntormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of expectation,\neach vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare perfection.\nBesides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in\ndue course, but for the way in which she treats us.\" \n\nThen Telemachus said, \"Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall\nsay no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people\nof Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty\nmen to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to\nPylos in quest of my father who has so long been missing. Some one\nmay tell me something, or (and people often hear things in this way)\nsome heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive\nand on his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will\nmake for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of\nhis death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with\nall due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make my mother marry\nagain.\" \n\nWith these words he sat down, and Mentor who had been a friend of\nUlysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority\nover the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty\naddressed them thus: \n\n\"Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably;\nI hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust,\nfor there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you\nas though he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors,\nfor if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts,\nand wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take\nthe high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked\nat the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop\nsuch scandalous goings on-which you could do if you chose, for you\nare many and they are few.\" \n\nLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, \"Mentor, what folly\nis all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard\nthing for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though\nUlysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house,\nand do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly,\nwould have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon\nhis own head if he fought against such great odds. There is no sense\nin what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about\nyour business, and let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses,\nspeed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all- which I do not think\nhe will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes\nand tells him something.\" \n\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\nabode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.\n\nThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in\nthe grey waves, and prayed to Minerva. \n\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"you god who visited me yesterday, and bade me\nsail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing.\nI would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked\nsuitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so.\" \n\nAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and\nwith the voice of Mentor. \"Telemachus,\" said she, \"if you are made\nof the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward\nhenceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half\ndone. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,\nbut unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins\nI see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men\nas their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as\nyou are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and are\nnot entirely without some share of your father's wise discernment,\nI look with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common\ncause with any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense\nnor virtue, and give no thought to death and to the doom that will\nshortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shall perish on\nthe same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your\nfather was such an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship,\nand will come with you myself. Now, however, return home, and go about\namong the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage;\nsee everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal,\nwhich is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the\ntown and beat up volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca\nboth old and new; I will run my eye over them for you and will choose\nthe best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay.\"\n\nThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in\ndoing as the goddess told him. He went moodily and found the suitors\nflaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous came\nup to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own, saying,\n\"Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood neither in\nword nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The Achaeans\nwill find you in everything- a ship and a picked crew to boot- so\nthat you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your noble\nfather.\" \n\n\"Antinous,\" answered Telemachus, \"I cannot eat in peace, nor take\npleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that\nyou should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?\nNow that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and\nwhether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do you\nall the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain though,\nthanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and\nmust be passenger not captain.\" \n\nAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile\nthe others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeering\nat him tauntingly as they did so. \n\n\"Telemachus,\" said one youngster, \"means to be the death of us; I\nsuppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or\nagain from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to\nEphyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?\"\n\nAnother said, \"Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be\nlike his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should\nhave plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst\nus: as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries\nher have that.\" \n\nThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty\nand spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze\nlay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes\nwere kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant\nolive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit\nfor a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should\ncome home again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors\nopening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea,\ndaughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both\nnight and day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and said:\n\n\"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you\nare keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should\nescape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve\njars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn\nleathern bags with barley meal- about twenty measures in all. Get\nthese things put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will\ntake everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs\nfor the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear\nanything about the return of my dear father. \n\nWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him,\nsaying, \"My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that\ninto your head? Where in the world do you want to go to- you, who\nare the one hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in\nsome foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back\nis turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out\nof the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves;\nstay where you are among your own people, and do not go wandering\nand worrying your life out on the barren ocean.\" \n\n\"Fear not, nurse,\" answered Telemachus, \"my scheme is not without\nheaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this\nto my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless\nshe hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to\nspoil her beauty by crying.\" \n\nThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she\nhad completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars,\nand getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus went back\nto the suitors. \n\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape,\nand went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet\nat the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius, and\nasked him to let her have a ship- which he was very ready to do. When\nthe sun had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship\ninto the water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally\ncarry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the\ncrew came up, and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.\n\nFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors\ninto a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them, and made\nthem drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting\nover their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their\neyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice\nof Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside. \n\n\"Telemachus,\" said she, \"the men are on board and at their oars, waiting\nfor you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.\"\n\nOn this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When\nthey got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side,\nand Telemachus said, \"Now my men, help me to get the stores on board;\nthey are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not\nknow anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.\"\n\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after. When\nthey had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,\nMinerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel,\nwhile Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and\ntook their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair wind from\nthe West, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon Telemachus\ntold them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did\nas he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,\nraised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted\ntheir white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the sail\nbellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue water,\nand the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then they\nmade all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls to the\nbrim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from\neverlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.\n\nThus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night\nfrom dark till dawn. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK III\n\nBut as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of\nheaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos\nthe city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea\nshore to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.\nThere were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were\nnine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats and\nburning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune, Telemachus\nand his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship to anchor,\nand went ashore. \n\nMinerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,\n\"Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have\ntaken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried\nand how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may\nsee what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and\nhe will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person.\" \n\n\"But how, Mentor,\" replied Telemachus, \"dare I go up to Nestor, and\nhow am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long\nconversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one\nwho is so much older than myself.\" \n\n\"Some things, Telemachus,\" answered Minerva, \"will be suggested to\nyou by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for\nI am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your\nbirth until now.\" \n\nShe then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till\nthey reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were\nassembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his\ncompany round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces\nof meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When they\nsaw the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and\nbade them take their places. Nestor's son Pisistratus at once offered\nhis hand to each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins\nthat were lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes.\nThen he gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine\nfor them into a golden cup, handing it to Minerva first, and saluting\nher at the same time. \n\n\"Offer a prayer, sir,\" said he, \"to King Neptune, for it is his feast\nthat you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink-offering,\npass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt not that\nhe too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without God\nin the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an\nage with myself, so I he handed I will give you the precedence.\"\n\nAs he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and\nproper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly began\npraying heartily to Neptune. \"O thou,\" she cried, \"that encirclest\nthe earth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call\nupon thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor\nand on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people\nsome handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you.\nLastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the\nmatter that has brought us in our to Pylos.\" \n\nWhen she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to Telemachus\nand he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were roasted\nand had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his portion\nand they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had had enough\nto eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"that our guests have done their dinner, it will be\nbest to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you,\nand from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail\nthe seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man's\nhand against you?\" \n\nTelemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask\nabout his father and get himself a good name. \n\n\"Nestor,\" said he, \"son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, you\nask whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under\nNeritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private not\npublic import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said\nto have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know\nwhat fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy,\nbut as regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even\nthat he is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he\nperished, nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was\nlost at sea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant\nat your knees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy\nend, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some\nother traveller, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things\nout of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what\nyou saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either\nby word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans,\nbear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" answered Nestor, \"you recall a time of much sorrow to\nmy mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while privateering\nunder Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of king Priam.\nOur best men all of them fell there- Ajax, Achilles, Patroclus peer\nof gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a man singularly\nfleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much more than\nthis; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? Though\nyou were to stay here and question me for five years, or even six,\nI could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would\nturn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did\nwe try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against\nus; during all this time there was no one who could compare with your\nfather in subtlety- if indeed you are his son- I can hardly believe\nmy eyes- and you talk just like him too- no one would say that people\nof such different ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had\nany kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council,\nbut in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how\nall might be ordered for the best. \n\n\"When however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail\nin our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex\nthe Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had Not all been either\nwise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through the\ndispleasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel\nbetween the two sons of Atreus. \n\n\"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be,\nfor it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they\nexplained why they had called- the people together, it seemed that\nMenelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased Agamemnon,\nwho thought that we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease\nthe anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might have known that he\nwould not prevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds\nthey do not change them lightly. So the two stood bandying hard words,\nwhereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the\nair, and were of two minds as to what they should do. \n\n\"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching\nmischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships\ninto the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the\nrest, about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We- the\nother half- embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven\nhad smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices\nto the gods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however,\ndid not yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel\nin the course of which some among us turned their ships back again,\nand sailed away under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon;\nbut I, and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I\nsaw that mischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with\nme, and his crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos,\nand found us making up our minds about our course- for we did not\nknow whether to go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this\nto our left, or inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of\nMimas. So we asked heaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect\nthat we should be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across\nthe open sea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang\nup which gave us a quick passage during the night to Geraestus, where\nwe offered many sacrifices to Neptune for having helped us so far\non our way. Four days later Diomed and his men stationed their ships\nin Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never fell light from\nthe day when heaven first made it fair for me. \n\n\"Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything\nabout the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were\nlost but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports\nthat have reached me since I have been here in my own house. They\nsay the Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemus;\nso also did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again,\nlost no men at sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the\nfield got safe home with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the\nworld you live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he\ncame to at the hands of Aegisthus- and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus\npresently pay. See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son\nbehind him to do as Orestes did, who killed false Aegisthus the murderer\nof his noble father. You too, then- for you are a tall, smart-looking\nfellow- show your mettle and make yourself a name in story.\"\n\n\"Nestor son of Neleus,\" answered Telemachus, \"honour to the Achaean\nname, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through\nall time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might\ngrant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors,\nwho are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no\nsuch happiness in store for me and for my father, so we must bear\nit as best we may.\" \n\n\"My friend,\" said Nestor, \"now that you remind me, I remember to have\nheard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposed towards\nyou and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely,\nor are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows\nbut what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels\nin full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him?\nIf Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses\nwhen we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so\nopenly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she\nwould take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would\nsoon some of them him, forget their wooing.\" \n\nTelemachus answered, \"I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be\nfar too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even\nthough the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall\nme.\" \n\nOn this Minerva said, \"Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven\nhas a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me, I\nshould not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided\nI could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get\nhome quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was\nby the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain,\nand when a man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no\nmatter how fond they are of him.\" \n\n\"Mentor,\" answered Telemachus, \"do not let us talk about it any more.\nThere is no chance of my father's ever coming back; the gods have\nlong since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,\nabout which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than\nany one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so\nthat it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor,\nand tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What\nwas Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better\na man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging\nelsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?\"\n\n\"I will tell you truly,\" answered Nestor, \"and indeed you have yourself\ndivined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy\nhad found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been\nno barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would\nhave been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures, and not a\nwoman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness;\nbut we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus who was\ntaking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon's\nwife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery. \n\n\"At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for\nshe was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a bard with\nher, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for\nTroy, that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had\ncounselled her destruction, Aegisthus thus this bard off to a desert\nisland and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon- after\nwhich she went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he\noffered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples\nwith tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.\n\n\"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good\nterms with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point\nof Athens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman\nof Menelaus' ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel\nin rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in\nhis hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had\nto wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral\nrites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed\non as far as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and\nmade it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided\nhis fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians\ndwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high\nheadland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called\nGortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as Phaestus the\nsea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arter Phaestus\nthe coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great\nshelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and\nwrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the\nother five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where\nMenelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of an alien\nspeech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his evil deed. For\nseven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and\nthe people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year Orestes\ncame back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his\nfather. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of\nfalse Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very\nday Menelaus came home, with as much treasure as his ships could carry.\n\n\"Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so far\nfrom home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your\nhouse; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will\nhave been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by all means\nto go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such\ndistant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from, when the\nwinds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds\ncannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast and terrible are\nthe seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take\nyour own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can\nhave a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can\nescort you to Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak\nthe truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.\"\n\nAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,\n\"Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues\nof the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings\nto Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is\nbed time. People should go away early and not keep late hours at a\nreligious festival.\" \n\nThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men servants\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the\nmixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\nevery man his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims\ninto the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings. When they\nhad made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded,\nMinerva and Telemachus were forgoing on board their ship, but Nestor\ncaught them up at once and stayed them. \n\n\"Heaven and the immortal gods,\" he exclaimed, \"forbid that you should\nleave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor\nand short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable\nto find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me\ntell you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit\nthe son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship-\nnot while I live- nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep\nopen house as have done.\" \n\nThen Minerva answered, \"Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be\nmuch better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore,\nshall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back\nto give orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only\nolder person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus'\nown age, who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return\nto the ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the Cauconians\nwhere I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus,\nnow that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and\nlet one of your sons go with him. Be pleased also to provide him with\nyour best and fleetest horses.\" \n\nWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and\nall marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemachus\nby the hand. \"My friend,\" said he, \"I see that you are going to be\na great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you\nare still so young. This can have been none other of those who dwell\nin heaven than Jove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who showed\nsuch favour towards your brave father among the Argives.\" \"Holy queen,\"\nhe continued, \"vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my good\nwife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a\nbroad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought\nby man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up\nto you in sacrifice.\" \n\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way\nto his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. When they\nhad got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats,\nhe mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when\nthe housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed\nthe wine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to Minerva, daughter\nof Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink-offerings\nand had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home\nto bed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in\nthe room that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, who was\nthe only unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an\ninner room of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.\n\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Nestor\nleft his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished\nmarble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus,\npeer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the\nhouse of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand, as guardian\nof the public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round\nhim, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth\nson was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him\nsit with them. Nestor then addressed them. \n\n\"My sons,\" said he, \"make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first\nand foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested\nherself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one\nor other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer,\nand come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus's\nship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the\nvessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to\ngild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you\nare; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and\nto fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also-\nto bring me some clear spring water.\" \n\nOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was\nbrought in from the plain, and Telemachus's crew came from the ship;\nthe goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he\nworked his gold, and Minerva herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor\ngave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that\nthe goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and\nEchephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the\nhouse in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other\nhand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by\nwith a sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a\nbucket. Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the\nbarley meal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a\nlock from the heifer's head upon the fire. \n\nWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal Thrasymedes\ndealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut\nthrough the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters\nand daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she\nwas eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they\nlifted the heifer's head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut\nher throat. When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut\nher up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them\nround in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the\ntop of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine\nover them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits\nin their hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the\ninward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces\non the spits and toasted them over the fire. \n\nMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed Telemachus.\nWhen she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him\na fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he came from\nthe bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the outer meats\nwere done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where\nthey were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them\nout their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had had enough\nto eat and drink Nestor said, \"Sons, put Telemachus's horses to the\nchariot that he may start at once.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the\nfleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision\nof bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemachus\ngot into the chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the reins and\ntook his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew forward\nnothing loth into the open country, leaving the high citadel of Pylos\nbehind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon their\nnecks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land. Then\nthey reached Pherae where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortilochus\nand grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diocles entertained\nthem hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared,\nthey again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under\nthe echoing gatehouse. Pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew\nforward nothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands Of the\nopen country, and in the course of time completed their journey, so\nwell did their steeds take them. \n\nNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK IV\n\nThey reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon them where they drove\nstraight to the of abode Menelaus [and found him in his own house,\nfeasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son,\nand also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that\nvaliant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her\nto him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing\nthe marriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses\nto the city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles' son was reigning.\nFor his only son he had found a bride from Sparta, daughter of Alector.\nThis son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven\nvouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, who\nwas fair as golden Venus herself. \n\nSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making\nmerry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play\nhis lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of\nthem when the man struck up with his tune.] \n\nTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,\nwhereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw\nthem ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went\nclose up to him and said, \"Menelaus, there are some strangers come\nhere, two men, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall\nwe take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as\nthey best can?\" \n\nMenelaus was very angry and said, \"Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you\nnever used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their\nhorses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have\nsupper; you and I have stayed often enough at other people's houses\nbefore we got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace\nhenceforward.\" \n\nSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. They\ntook their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to the\nmangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they\nleaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led\nthe way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished\nwhen they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon;\nthen, when they had admired everything to their heart's content, they\nwent into the bath room and washed themselves. \n\nWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they\nbrought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats\nby the side of Menelaus. A maidservant brought them water in a beautiful\ngolden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their\nhands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought\nthem bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in\nthe house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats\nand set cups of gold by their side. \n\nMenelaus then greeted them saying, \"Fall to, and welcome; when you\nhave done supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such\nmen as you cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line\nof sceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as\nyou are.\" \n\nOn this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set\nnear him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good\nthings that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat\nand drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so\nclose that no one might hear, \"Look, Pisistratus, man after my own\nheart, see the gleam of bronze and gold- of amber, ivory, and silver.\nEverything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian\nJove. I am lost in admiration.\" \n\nMenelaus overheard him and said, \"No one, my sons, can hold his own\nwith Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but\namong mortal men- well, there may be another who has as much wealth\nas I have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much\nand have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before\nI could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the\nEgyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians,\nand to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born,\nand the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that country,\nwhether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk,\nfor the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling\nand getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly\nand shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, so\nthat I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever\nyour parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of\nmy heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and magnificently\nfurnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so that\nI had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the\nplain of Troy, far from Argos. I of grieve, as I sit here in my house,\nfor one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently\nI leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of\nit. Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for one man more than for\nthem all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and\nsleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one of all the Achaeans\nworked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing by it,\nand has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a\nlong time, and we know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father,\nhis long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he\nleft behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.\"\n\nThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought\nhim of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned,\nso that he held his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaus\nsaw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking,\nor to ask him at once and find what it was all about. \n\nWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted\nand perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought\nher a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the\nsilver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus\nlived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world;\nhe gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and\nten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful\npresents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work-box that ran\non wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed\nthis by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with\nviolet coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took\nher seat, put her feet upon the footstool, and began to question her\nhusband. \n\n\"Do we know, Menelaus,\" said she, \"the names of these strangers who\nhave come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?-but I cannot\nhelp saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman\nso like somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what\nto think) as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left\nas a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in\nyour hearts, on account of my most shameless self.\" \n\n\"My dear wife,\" replied Menelaus, \"I see the likeness just as you\ndo. His hands and feet are just like Ulysses'; so is his hair, with\nthe shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when\nI was talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on\nmy account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.\"\n\nThen Pisistratus said, \"Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in\nthinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest,\nand is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one\nwhose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father,\nNestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether\nyou could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble\nat home when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters;\nand this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent,\nand there is no one among his own people to stand by him.\"\n\n\"Bless my heart,\" replied Menelaus, \"then I am receiving a visit from\nthe son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship for my sake.\nI had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when\nheaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should\nhave founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should\nhave made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people,\nand should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities\nthat are subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually,\nand nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an\nintercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great\ngood fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting\nhome at all.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,\nTelemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his\neyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus\nwhom the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,\n\n\"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told\nme you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then,\nit be possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while\nI am getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the\nforenoon I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone.\nThis is all we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads\nfor them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who\ndied at Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure\nto have known him- his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon\nhim myself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and\nin fight valiant.\" \n\n\"Your discretion, my friend,\" answered Menelaus, \"is beyond your years.\nIt is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man\nis son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring-\nand it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days, giving\nhim a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who are\nboth we disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all\nthis weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water be poured\nover our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in\nthe morning.\" \n\nOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands\nand they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.\n\nThen Jove's daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged\nthe wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour.\nWhoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the\nrest of the day, not even though his father and mother both of them\ndrop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before\nhis very eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had\nbeen given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where\nthere grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into the mixing-bowl\nand others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is\na skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen\nhad put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve\nthe wine round, she said: \n\n\"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable\nmen (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and\nevil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen\nwhile I tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single\none of the exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he\nwas before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties.\nHe covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in\nrags, and entered the enemy's city looking like a menial or a beggar.\nand quite different from what he did when he was among his own people.\nIn this disguise he entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything\nto him. I alone recognized him and began to question him, but he was\ntoo cunning for me. When, however, I had washed and anointed him and\nhad given him clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not to\nbetray him to the Trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp\nand to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant to do. He\nkilled many Trojans and got much information before he reached the\nArgive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation,\nbut for my own part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to oam\nafter my home, and I was unhappy about wrong that Venus had done me\nin taking me over there, away from my country, my girl, and my lawful\nwedded husband, who is indeed by no means deficient either in person\nor understanding.\" \n\nThen Menelaus said, \"All that you have been saying, my dear wife,\nis true. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes,\nbut I have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance\ntoo, and what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein\nall the bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and\ndestruction upon the Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; some\ngod who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and\nyou had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding\nplace and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and\nmimicked all our wives -Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside\nheard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds\nwhether to spring out then and there, or to answer you from inside,\nbut Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except\nAnticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his\ntwo brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this\nthat saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away\nagain.\" \n\n\"How sad,\" exclaimed Telemachus, \"that all this was of no avail to\nsave him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased to\nsend us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon\nof sleep.\" \n\nOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that\nwas in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread\ncoverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to\nwear. So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds,\nto which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then,\ndid Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while\nthe son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.\n\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaus\nrose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,\ngirded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like\nan immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:\n\n\"And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to\nLacedaemon? Are you on public or private business? Tell me all about\nit.\" \n\n\"I have come, sir replied Telemachus, \"to see if you can tell me anything\nabout my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate\nis being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing\ngreat numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of paying their\naddresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your knees if\nhaply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end, whether you\nsaw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller;\nfor he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any\npity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw.\nIf my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word\nor deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in\nmind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.\" \n\nMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. \"So,\" he exclaimed,\n\"these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well\nlay her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed\nin the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back\nto his lair will make short work with the pair of them- and so will\nUlysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if\nUlysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides\nin Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered\nhim- if he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they\nwould have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions,\nhowever, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you\nwithout concealment all that the old man of the sea told me.\n\n\"I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt,\nfor my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods\nare very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far\nas a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there\nis an island called Pharos- it has a good harbour from which vessels\ncan get out into open sea when they have taken in water- and the gods\nbecalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to\nhelp me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my\nmen would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and\nsaved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man\nof the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me. \n\n\"She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for\nthe men used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in\nthe hope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of\nhunger. 'Stranger,' said she, 'it seems to me that you like starving\nin this way- at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you\nstick here day after day, without even trying to get away though your\nmen are dying by inches.' \n\n\"'Let me tell you,' said I, 'whichever of the goddesses you may happen\nto be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have\noffended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the\ngods know everything. which of the immortals it is that is hindering\nme in this way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach\nmy home.' \n\n\"'Stranger,' replied she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you.\nThere is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose\nname is Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father;\nhe is Neptune's head man and knows every inch of ground all over the\nbottom of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will\ntell you about your voyage, what courses you are to take, and how\nyou are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also tell\nyou, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house both\ngood and bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerous\njourney.' \n\n\"'Can you show me,' said I, 'some stratagem by means of which I may\ncatch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For\na god is not easily caught- not by a mortal man.' \n\n\"'Stranger,' said she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you. About\nthe time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of\nthe sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that\nfurs the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down,\nand goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals- Halosydne's\nchickens as they call them- come up also from the grey sea, and go\nto sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and fish-like\nsmell do they bring with them. Early to-morrow morning I will take\nyou to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore,\nthe three best men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all\nthe tricks that the old man will play you. \n\n\"'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when\nhe has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go\nto sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you\nsee that he is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold\nhim fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He\nwill turn himself into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth,\nand will become also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast\nand grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you and\ncomes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may\nslacken your hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the\ngods it is that is angry with you, and what you must do to reach your\nhome over the seas.' \n\n\"Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to\nthe place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart\nwas clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got\nsupper ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.\n\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I took the\nthree men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went\nalong by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess\nfetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them\njust skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father. Then\nshe dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should\ncome up. When we were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits\none after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade\nwould have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was\nmost distressing- who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could\nhelp it?-but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something\nthat gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each man's\nnostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals.\n\n\"We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the\nseals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon\nthe old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat\nseals he went over them and counted them. We were among the first\nhe counted, and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down\nto sleep as soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him\nwith a shout and seized him; on which he began at once with his old\ntricks, and changed himself first into a lion with a great mane; then\nall of a sudden he became a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next\nmoment he was running water, and then again directly he was a tree,\nbut we stuck to him and never lost hold, till at last the cunning\nold creature became distressed, and said, Which of the gods was it,\nSon of Atreus, that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and\nseizing me against my will? What do you want?' \n\n\"'You know that yourself, old man,' I answered, 'you will gain nothing\nby trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in\nthis island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing\nall heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the\nimmortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail\nthe sea so as to reach my home?' \n\n\"Then,' he said, 'if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,\nyou must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before\nembarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your friends,\nand to your own house, till you have returned to the heaven fed stream\nof Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods that reign\nin heaven. When you have done this they will let you finish your voyage.'\n\n\"I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long\nand terrible voyage to Egypt; nevertheless, I answered, 'I will do\nall, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell\nme true, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us\nwhen we set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one\nof them came to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his\nfriends when the days of his fighting were done.' \n\n\"'Son of Atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? You had better not know\nwhat I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have\nheard my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone,\nbut many still remain, and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans\nperished during their return home. As for what happened on the field\nof battle- you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still\nat sea, alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for\nNeptune drove him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he\nlet him get safe out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva's hatred\nhe would have escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting.\nHe said the gods could not drown him even though they had tried to\ndo so, and when Neptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident\nin his two brawny hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces.\nThe base remained where it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting\nfell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt\nwater and was drowned. \n\n\"'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, but\nwhen he was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he was\ncaught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against\nhis will, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell,\nbut where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed\nas though he was to return safely after all, for the gods backed the\nwind into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon\nkissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in\nhis own country. \n\n\"'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch,\nand to whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had been\nlooking out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give\nhim the slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon\ngo by, he went and told Aegisthus who at once began to lay a plot\nfor him. He picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them\nin ambuscade on one side the cloister, while on the opposite side\nhe prepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon,\nand invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there,\nall unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him\nwhen the banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the\nshambles; not one of Agamemnon's followers was left alive, nor yet\none of Aegisthus', but they were all killed there in the cloisters.'\n\n\"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat\ndown upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear\nto live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had\nhad my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of\nthe sea said, 'Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying\nso bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast\nas ever you can, for Aegisthus be still alive, and even though Orestes\nhas beforehand with you in kilting him, you may yet come in for his\nfuneral.' \n\n\"On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, 'I know,\nthen, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of\nwhom you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home?\nor is he dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.'\n\n\"'The third man,' he answered, 'is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I\ncan see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph\nCalypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home\nfor he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your\nown end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take\nyou to the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There\nfair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than\nany where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain,\nnor hail, nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that\nsings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This will\nhappen to you because you have married Helen, and are Jove's son-in-law.'\n\n\"As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the\nships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I\nwent along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night\nwas falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,\nrosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and\nput our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves,\ntook our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars.\nI again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and\noffered hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased\nheaven's anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of Agamemnon that\nhis name might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home,\nfor the gods sent me a fair wind. \n\n\"And now for yourself- stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and\nI will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present\nof a chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice\nthat so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a drink-offering\nto the immortal gods.\" \n\n\"Son of Atreus,\" replied Telemachus, \"do not press me to stay longer;\nI should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months;\nI find your conversation so delightful that I should never once wish\nmyself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos\nare already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for\nany present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that it should\nhe a piece of plate. I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca,\nbut will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have much flat\nground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as also meadowsweet and\nwheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas\nin Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country\nis more fit for goats than horses, and I like it the better for that.\nNone of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and\nIthaca least of all.\" \n\nMenelaus smiled and took Telemachus's hand within his own. \"What you\nsay,\" said he, \"shows that you come of good family. I both can, and\nwill, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most\nprecious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl by Vulcan's\nown hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold.\nPhaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit\nwhich I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey. I\nwill make you a present of it.\" \n\nThus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king's house.\nThey brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for\nthem to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in\nthe courts]. \n\nMeanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at\na mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses' house, and were\nbehaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who\nwere their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were\nsitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to Antinous,\n\n\"Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?\nHe has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis: I have\ntwelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not\nyet broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break\nhim.\" \n\nThey were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that\nTelemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was\nonly away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with\nthe swineherd; so Antinous said, \"When did he go? Tell me truly, and\nwhat young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own\nbondsmen- for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let\nhim have the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did\nhe take it without yourleave?\" \n\n\"I lent it him,\" answered Noemon, \"what else could I do when a man\nof his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige\nhim? I could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they\nwere the best young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain-\nor some god who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for\nI saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting\nout for Pylos.\" \n\nNoemon then went back to his father's house, but Antinous and Eurymachus\nwere very angry. They told the others to leave off playing, and to\ncome and sit down along with themselves. When they came, Antinous\nson of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with rage, and\nhis eyes flashed fire as he said: \n\n\"Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter;\nwe had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow\nhas got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be\ngiving us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown.\nFind me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie\nin wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then\nrue the day that he set out to try and get news of his father.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then\nall of them went inside the buildings. \n\nIt was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were plotting;\nfor a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the outer court\nas they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell his mistress.\nAs he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said: \"Medon, what\nhave the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the maids to leave\ntheir master's business and cook dinner for them? I wish they may\nneither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else,\nbut let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of\nmy son's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children\nhow good Ulysses had been to them- never doing anything high-handed,\nnor speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and\nthey may take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses\nnever did an unjust thing by anybody- which shows what bad hearts\nyou have, and that there is no such thing as gratitude left in this\nworld.\" \n\nThen Medon said, \"I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are\nplotting something much more dreadful now- may heaven frustrate their\ndesign. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming\nhome from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his\nfather.\" \n\nThen Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she was\nspeechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no utterance.\nAt last, however, she said, \"Why did my son leave me? What business\nhad he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the\nocean like sea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one\nbehind him to keep up his name?\" \n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Medon, \"whether some god set him on to it,\nor whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out\nif his father was dead, or alive and on his way home.\" \n\nThen he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.\nThere were plenty of seats in the house, but she. had no heart for\nsitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor\nof her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both\nold and young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last\nin a transport of sorrow she exclaimed, \n\n\"My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction\nthan any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave\nand lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven,\nand whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now\nmy darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my\nhaving heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was\nnot one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my\nbed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If\nI had known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give\nit up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse\nbehind him- one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call old\nDolius, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is my\ngardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything to Laertes, who may\nbe able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side,\nas against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and that\nof Ulysses.\" \n\nThen the dear old nurse Euryclea said, \"You may kill me, Madam, or\nlet me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell\nyou the real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he\nwanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn\noath that I would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days,\nunless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did\nnot want you to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash\nyour face, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer\nprayers to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save\nhim even though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes:\nhe has trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods\nhate die race of the race of the son of Arceisius so much, but there\nwill be a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house\nand the fair fields that lie far all round it.\" \n\nWith these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried\nthe tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress,\nand went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley\ninto a basket and began praying to Minerva. \n\n\"Hear me,\" she cried, \"Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable.\nIf ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep\nor heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling\nson from the villainy of the suitors.\" \n\nShe cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer; meanwhile\nthe suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister, and one\nof them said: \n\n\"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.\nLittle does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.\"\n\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what was going to happen.\nThen Antinous said, \"Comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest\nsome of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in silence,\nabout which we are all of a mind.\" \n\nHe then chose twenty men, and they went down to their. ship and to\nthe sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast\nand sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted\nthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft,\nwhile their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made\nthe ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers,\nand waited till night should fall. \n\nBut Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink,\nand wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered\nby the wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen\nhemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank\ninto a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.\n\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in\nthe likeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who\nhad married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go\nto the house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so\nit came into her room by the hole through which the thong went for\npulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying, \n\n\"You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer\nyou to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he\nwill yet come back to you.\" \n\nPenelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,\n\"Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often, but I\nsuppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then,\nto leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture\nme? I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every\ngood quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas\nand middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of\na ship- a foolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor\nto going about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about\nhim than about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him,\nlest something should happen to him, either from the people among\nwhom he has gone, or by sea, for he has many enemies who are plotting\nagainst him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home.\"\n\nThen the vision said, \"Take heart, and be not so much dismayed. There\nis one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have\nstand by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon\nyou, and who has sent me to bear you this message.\" \n\n\"Then,\" said Penelope, \"if you are a god or have been sent here by\ndivine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one- is he\nstill alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?\"\n\nAnd the vision said, \"I shall not tell you for certain whether he\nis alive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.\"\n\nThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated\ninto thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted,\nso vivid had been her dream. \n\nMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the\nsea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called\nAsteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos,\nand there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie.\nHere then the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK V\n\nAnd now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus- harbinger of\nlight alike to mortals and immortals- the gods met in council and\nwith them, Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva\nbegan to tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied\nhim away there in the house of the nymph Calypso. \n\n\"Father Jove,\" said she, \"and all you other gods that live in everlasting\nbliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed\nruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope they will\nbe all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects\nbut has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as though he were their\nfather. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where dwells\nthe nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get back\nto his own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take\nhim over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to murder\nhis only son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon,\nwhere he has been to see if he can get news of his father.\"\n\n\"What, my dear, are you talking about?\" replied her father, \"did you\nnot send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses\nto get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able\nto protect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while the\nsuitors have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, \"Mercury, you\nare our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that\npoor Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods\nnor men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he\nis to reach fertile Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, who are near\nof kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he were one of ourselves.\nThey will send him in a ship to his own country, and will give him\nmore bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back from\nTroy, if he had had had all his prize money and had got home without\ndisaster. This is how we have settled that he shall return to his\ncountry and his friends.\" \n\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did\nas he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals\nwith which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the\nwand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just as\nhe pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped\ndown through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose\nwaves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and\ncorner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray.\nHe flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to\nthe island which was his journey's end, he left the sea and went on\nby land till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.\n\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth,\nand one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and\nsandal wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her\ngolden shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her\ncave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress\ntrees, wherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests- owls,\nhawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the\nwaters. A vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly\nabout the mouth of the cave; there were also four running rills of\nwater in channels cut pretty close together, and turned hither and\nthither so as to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage\nover which they flowed. Even a god could not help being charmed with\nsuch a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when\nhe had admired it sufficiently he went inside the cave. \n\nCalypso knew him at once- for the gods all know each other, no matter\nhow far they live from one another- but Ulysses was not within; he\nwas on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with\ntears in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso\ngave Mercury a seat and said: \"Why have you come to see me, Mercury-\nhonoured, and ever welcome- for you do not visit me often? Say what\nyou want; I will do it for be you at once if I can, and if it can\nbe done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before\nyou. \n\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and\nmixed him some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had\nenough, and then said: \n\n\"We are speaking god and goddess to one another, one another, and\nyou ask me why I have come here, and I will tell you truly as you\nwould have me do. Jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could\npossibly want to come all this way over the sea where there are no\ncities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs?\nNevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can cross Jove,\nnor transgress his orders. He says that you have here the most ill-starred\nof alf those who fought nine years before the city of King Priam and\nsailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On their way\nhome they sinned against Minerva, who raised both wind and waves against\nthem, so that all his brave companions perished, and he alone was\ncarried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you are to let this\nby man go at once, for it is decreed that he shall not perish here,\nfar from his own people, but shall return to his house and country\nand see his friends again.\" \n\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, \"You gods,\" she exclaimed,\nto be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous and hate seeing\na goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open\nmatrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious\ngods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed him in Ortygia.\nSo again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to him in\na thrice ploughed fallow field, Jove came to hear of it before so\nlong and killed Iasion with his thunder-bolts. And now you are angry\nwith me too because I have a man here. I found the poor creature sitting\nall alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with lightning\nand sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while\nhe himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond\nof him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal,\nso that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot cross\nJove, nor bring his counsels to nothing; therefore, if he insists\nupon it, let the man go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him\nanywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men who can take him.\nNevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good faith,\nas will be likely to bring him safely to his own country.\"\n\n\"Then send him away,\" said Mercury, \"or Jove will be angry with you\nand punish you\"' \n\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses,\nfor she had heard Jove's message. She found him sitting upon the beach\nwith his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home-sickness;\nfor he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep\nwith her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have\nit so. As for the day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea-shore,\nweeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon\nthe sea. Calypso then went close up to him said: \n\n\"My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your\nlife out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will;\nso go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with\nan upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put\nbread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. I will\nalso give you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home,\nif the gods in heaven so will it- for they know more about these things,\nand can settle them better than I can.\" \n\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. \"Now goddess,\" he answered, \"there\nis something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help\nme home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on\na raft. Not even a well-found ship with a fair wind could venture\non such a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall mage\nme go on board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean\nme no mischief.\" \n\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: \"You know a\ngreat deal,\" said she, \"but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above\nand earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx-\nand this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take- that\nI mean you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly\nwhat I should do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite\nstraightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry\nfor you.\" \n\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses\nfollowed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on\ntill they came to Calypso's cave, where Ulysses took the seat that\nMercury had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of the\nfood that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar for\nherself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were before\nthem. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink, Calypso\nspoke, saying: \n\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own\nland at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how\nmuch suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own\ncountry, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and\nlet me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see\nthis wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after\nday; yet I flatter myself that at am no whit less tall or well-looking\nthan she is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should\ncompare in beauty with an immortal.\" \n\n\"Goddess,\" replied Ulysses, \"do not be angry with me about this. I\nam quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so\nbeautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal.\nNevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing else. If\nsome god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and make the\nbest of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea already,\nso let this go with the rest.\" \n\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired\ninto the inner part of the cave and went to bed. \n\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Ulysses put\non his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light\ngossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle\nabout her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself\nto think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a\ngreat bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides,\nand had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She\nalso gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of\nthe island where the largest trees grew- alder, poplar and pine, that\nreached the sky- very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for\nhim in the water. Then, when she had shown him where the best trees\ngrew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished\ndoing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring\nthem by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back\nwith some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers\ntogether with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled\nshipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he filed a deck on\ntop of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast\nwith a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all\nround with wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then\nhe threw on a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him some\nlinen to make the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making\nthem fast with braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers,\nhe drew the raft down into the water. \n\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso\nsent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean\nclothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another\nlarger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions,\nand found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair\nand warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it,\nwhile he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder.\nHe never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting\nBootes, and on the Bear- which men also call the wain, and which turns\nround and round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping\ninto the stream of Oceanus- for Calypso had told him to keep this\nto his left. Days seven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the\neighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of\nthe Phaeacian coast appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon.\n\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight\nof Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could\nsee him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged\nhis head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so the gods have\nbeen changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia,\nand now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed\nthat he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Still,\nhe shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with it.\"\n\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred\nit round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows\ntill earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth\nout of the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon\nhim all at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses'\nheart began to fail him. \"Alas,\" he said to himself in his dismay,\n\"what ever will become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she\nsaid I should have trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all\ncoming true. How black is Jove making heaven with his clouds, and\nwhat a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once. I am\nnow safe to perish. Blest and thrice blest were those Danaans who\nfell before Troy in the cause of the sons of Atreus. Would that had\nbeen killed on the day when the Trojans were pressing me so sorely\nabout the dead body of Achilles, for then I should have had due burial\nand the Achaeans would have honoured my name; but now it seems that\nI shall come to a most pitiable end.\" \n\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the\nraft reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He\nlet go the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that\nit broke the mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into\nthe sea. For a long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he\ncould do to rise to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had\ngiven him weighed him down; but at last he got his head above water\nand spat out the bitter brine that was running down his face in streams.\nIn spite of all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft,\nbut swam as fast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed\non board again so as to escape drowning. The sea took the raft and\ntossed it about as Autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round\nupon a road. It was as though the South, North, East, and West winds\nwere all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it at once.\n\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called Leucothea,\nsaw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been since raised\nto the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great distress Ulysses\nnow was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull\nfrom the waves, took her seat upon the raft. \n\n\"My poor good man,\" said she, \"why is Neptune so furiously angry with\nyou? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster\nhe will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as\nI bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind, and swim\nto the Phaecian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take\nmy veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can\ncome to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land\ntake it off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then\ngo away again.\" With these words she took off her veil and gave it\nhim. Then she dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath\nthe dark blue waters. \n\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. \"Alas,\" he said to himself\nin his dismay, \"this is only some one or other of the gods who is\nluring me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. At any rate\nI will not do so at present, for the land where she said I should\nbe quit of all troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know\nwhat I will do- I am sure it will be best- no matter what happens\nI will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but\nwhen the sea breaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I\ncan do any better than this.\" \n\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave\nthat seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over\nthe raft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry\nchaff tossed about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank\nand rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off the\nclothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino's veil under his arms, and\nplunged into the sea- meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched\nhim as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying,\n\"'There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall in with\nwell-to-do people. I do not think you will be able to say that I have\nlet you off too lightly.\" On this he lashed his horses and drove to\nAegae where his palace is. \n\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all\nthe winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused\na good stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till\nUlysses reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.\n\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water,\nwith a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but\nwhen the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm\nwithout so much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell\nhe looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children\nrejoice when their dear father begins to get better after having for\na long time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but\nthe gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when he again\nsaw land and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might\nonce more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot,\nhe began to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the\nswell still broke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was\nenveloped in spray; there were no harbours where a ship might ride,\nnor shelter of any kind, but only headlands, low-lying rocks, and\nmountain tops. \n\nUlysses' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to\nhimself, \"Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that\nI had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the\ncoast is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer\nfrom the sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannot climb\nout for want of foothold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me\noff my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave the water- which\nwould give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further\nin search of some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry\nme out to sea again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some\ngreat monster of the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many\nsuch, and I know that Neptune is very angry with me.\" \n\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with\nsuch force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn\nto pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold\nof the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till\nthe wave retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave\ncame on again and carried him back with it far into the sea-tearing\nhis hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks\nit from its bed, and the stones come up along with it even so did\nthe rocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew\nhim deep down under the water. \n\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his\nown destiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about\nhim. He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating\nagainst the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the\nshore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take\nthe waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of\na river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there were\nno rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there\nwas a current, so he prayed inwardly and said: \n\n\"Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of\nthe sea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has\nlost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore\nin my distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees\nof your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself\nyour suppliant.\" \n\nThen the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm\nbefore him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here\nat last Ulysses' knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had\ncompletely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and\nnostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither\nbreathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,\nwhen he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off\nthe scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt stream\nof the river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave\nthat bore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down\namong the rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth. \n\n\"Alas,\" he cried to himself in his dismay, \"what ever will become\nof me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed\nthrough the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the\nbitter cold and damp may make an end of me- for towards sunrise there\nwill be a keen wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand,\nI climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some\nthicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night's rest, but some\nsavage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.\" \n\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one\nupon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath\ntwo shoots of olive that grew from a single stock- the one an ungrafted\nsucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally,\ncould break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun's rays\npierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow\ninto one another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself\na bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying\nabout- enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard\nwinter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself\ndown and heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone\nin the country, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed\nin the ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere,\neven so did Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed\na sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose\nall memories of his sorrows. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VI\n\nSo here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went\noff to the country and city of the Phaecians- a people who used to\nlive in the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now\nthe Cyclopes were stronger than they and plundered them, so their\nking Nausithous moved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far\nfrom all other people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses\nand temples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead\nand gone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels\nwere inspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did\nMinerva hie in furtherance of the return of Ulysses. \n\nShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there\nslept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to\nKing Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very\npretty, one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well-made\nfolding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's\ndaughter, who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age;\nthen, coming up to the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered\nover her head and said: \n\n\"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy\ndaughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are\ngoing to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well\ndressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend\nyou. This is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your\nfather and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow\na washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you so\nthat you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the\nbest young men among your own people are courting you, and you are\nnot going to remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore,\nto have a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs,\nrobes, and girdles; and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter\nfor you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the\ntown.\" \n\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they say\nis the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and\nneither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine\nand in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are\nillumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which the goddess\nwent when she had given instructions to the girl. \n\nBy and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering about\nher dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell\nher father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room.\nHer mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with\nher maids around her, and she happened to catch her father just as\nhe was going out to attend a meeting of the town council, which the\nPhaeacian aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:\n\n\"Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want\nto take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are\nthe chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a clean\nshirt when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have\nfive sons at home, two of them married, while the other three are\ngood-looking bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen\nwhen they go to a dance, and I have been thinking about all this.\"\n\nShe did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like\nto, but her father knew and said, \"You shall have the mules, my love,\nand whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men\nshall get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold\nall your clothes.\" \n\nOn this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon out,\nharnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the clothes\ndown from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her mother\nprepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things,\nand a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon, and\nher mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women\nmight anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and reins and lashed\nthe mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the\nroad. They pulled without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa\nand her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were with her.\n\nWhen they reached the water side they went to the washing-cisterns,\nthrough which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any\nquantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the\nmules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that\ngrew by the water side. They took the clothes out of the waggon, put\nthem in the water, and vied with one another in treading them in the\npits to get the dirt out. After they had washed them and got them\nquite clean, they laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had\nraised a high beach of shingle, and set about washing themselves and\nanointing themselves with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by\nthe side of the stream, and waited for the sun to finish drying the\nclothes. When they had done dinner they threw off the veils that covered\ntheir heads and began to play at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them.\nAs the huntress Diana goes forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or\nErymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer, and the wood-nymphs, daughters\nof Aegis-bearing Jove, take their sport along with her (then is Leto\nproud at seeing her daughter stand a full head taller than the others,\nand eclipse the loveliest amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so\ndid the girl outshine her handmaids. \n\nWhen it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the\nclothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider\nhow Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct\nhim to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball\nat one of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On\nthis they all shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, who sat\nup in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.\n\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself, \"what kind of people have I come amongst?\nAre they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or hospitable and humane?\nI seem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those\nof the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows\nof green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let\nme try if I cannot manage to get a look at them.\" \n\nAs he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough\ncovered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some\nlion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength\nand defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest\nof oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even\ninto a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep- even such\ndid Ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked\nas he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and\nso begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off along the spits\nthat jutted out into the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm,\nfor Minerva put courage into her heart and took away all fear from\nher. She stood right in front of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he\nshould go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees\nas a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her to give him some\nclothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he deemed it\nbest to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offence\nat his coming near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her\nin honeyed and persuasive language. \n\n\"O queen,\" he said, \"I implore your aid- but tell me, are you a goddess\nor are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven,\nI can only conjecture that you are Jove's daughter Diana, for your\nface and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are\na mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and mother-\nthrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted\nthey must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself going out\nto a dance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose wedding gifts\nhave been the richest, and who takes you to his own home. I never\nyet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost in\nadmiration as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young palm\ntree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of Apollo-\nfor I was there, too, with much people after me, when I was on that\njourney which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet did\nsuch a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I admired\nand wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at yourself.\nI dare not clasp your knees, but I am in great distress; yesterday\nmade the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the sea.\nThe winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian island,\nand now fate has flung me upon this coast that I may endure still\nfurther suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to the\nend of it, but rather that heaven has still much evil in store for\nme. \n\n\"And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person\nI have met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way\nto your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither\nto wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart's\ndesire- husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing\nbetter in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind\nin a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their\nfriends glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one.\"\n\nTo this Nausicaa answered, \"Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,\nwell-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives\nprosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take what\nhe has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now, however,\nthat you have come to this our country, you shall not want for clothes\nnor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably\nlook for. I will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the\nname of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to\nAlcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested.\"\n\nThen she called her maids and said, \"Stay where you are, you girls.\nCan you not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him\nfor a robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here\nto do us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live\napart on a land's end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing\nto do with any other people. This is only some poor man who has lost\nhis way, and we must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners\nin distress are under Jove's protection, and will take what they can\nget and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something to\neat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered\nfrom the wind.\" \n\nOn this the maids left off running away and began calling one another\nback. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told\nthem, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the\nlittle golden cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in the stream.\nBut Ulysses said, \"Young women, please to stand a little on one side\nthat I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with\noil, for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon\nit. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed\nto strip before a number of good-looking young women.\" \n\nThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses\nwashed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back\nand from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself,\nand had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil,\nand put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then\nmade him look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair\ngrow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth\nblossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful\nworkman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva\nenriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it- and his work is full\nof beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach,\nlooking quite young and handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration;\nthen she said to her maids: \n\n\"Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who\nlive in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first\nsaw him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of\nthe gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be\njust such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want\nto go away. However, give him something to eat and drink.\"\n\nThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and\ndrank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.\nMeanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen\nfolded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as\nshe took her seat, she called Ulysses: \n\n\"Stranger,\" said she, \"rise and let us be going back to the town;\nI will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I\ncan tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaecians.\nBut be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible person.\nAs long as we are going past the fields- and farm lands, follow briskly\nbehind the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself.\nPresently, however, we shall come to the town, where you will find\na high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on either side\nwith a narrow entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn\nup by the road side, for every one has a place where his own ship\ncan lie. You will see the market place with a temple of Neptune in\nthe middle of it, and paved with large stones bedded in the earth.\nHere people deal in ship's gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails,\nand here, too, are the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians\nare not a nation of archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows,\nbut are a sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars,\nand ships, with which they travel far over the sea. \n\n\"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against\nme later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low\nfellow, if he met us, might say, 'Who is this fine-looking stranger\nthat is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she End him? I suppose\nshe is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she\nhas taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no neighbours; or\nsome god has at last come down from heaven in answer to her prayers,\nand she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It would\nbe a good thing if she would take herself of I for sh and find a husband\nsomewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent\nyoung Phaeacians who are in with her.' This is the kind of disparaging\nremark that would be made about me, and I could not complain, for\nI should myself be scandalized at seeing any other girl do the like,\nand go about with men in spite of everybody, while her father and\nmother were still alive, and without having been married in the face\nof all the world. \n\n\"If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help\nyou home, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars\nby the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow\nall round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about\nas far from the town as a man' voice will carry. Sit down there and\nwait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach\nmy father's house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come\ninto the town and ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous.\nYou will have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it\nout to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything like such\na fine house as he has. When you have got past the gates and through\nthe outer court, go right across the inner court till you come to\nmy mother. You will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her\npurple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leans\nback against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind\nher. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on which he sits\nand topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my mother,\nand lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If\nyou can gain her over, you may hope to see your own country again,\nno matter how distant it may be.\" \n\nSo saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.\nThe mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.\nShe was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were\nfollowing on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip with\njudgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove\nof Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter\nof Jove. \n\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable,\nhear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking\nme. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends\nand be hospitably received by the Phaecians.\" \n\nThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not\nshow herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune,\nwho was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting\nhome. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VII\n\nThus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the\ntown. When she reached her father's house she drew up at the gateway,\nand her brothers- comely as the gods- gathered round her, took the\nmules out of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while\nshe went to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira,\nlit the fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from\nApeira, and had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was\nking over the Phaecians, and the people obeyed him as though he were\na god. She had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for\nher, and brought her supper for her into her own room. \n\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed\na thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaecians\nwho met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as\nhe was just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness\nof a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of him,\nand Ulysses said: \n\n\"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?\nI am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in\nyour town and country.\" \n\nThen Minerva said, \"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house\nyou want, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will\ngo before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and\ndo not look at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here\ncannot abide strangers, and do not like men who come from some other\nplace. They are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace\nof Neptune in ships that glide along like thought, or as a bird in\nthe air.\" \n\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not\none of the Phaecians could see him as he passed through the city in\nthe midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will\ntowards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired\ntheir harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of\nthe city, which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking,\nand when they reached the king's house Minerva said: \n\n\"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show\nyou. You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but\ndo not be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more\nlikely he is to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First\nfind the queen. Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family\nas her husband Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune,\nwho was father to Nausithous by Periboea, a woman of great beauty.\nPeriboea was the youngest daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned\nover the giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own\nlife to boot. \n\n\"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him,\nthe great Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaecians. Nausithous had\ntwo sons Rhexenor and Alcinous; Apollo killed the first of them while\nhe was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter\nArete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other woman is honoured\nof all those that keep house along with their husbands. \n\n\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon\nher as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city,\nfor she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when\nany women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to\nsettle their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have\nevery hope of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to\nyour home and country.\" \n\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to\nMarathon and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered\nthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,\nand he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold\nof bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun\nor moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end,\nand the cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung\non pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel\nwas silver and the hook of the door was of gold. \n\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan,\nwith his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over\nthe palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never\ngrow old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from\none end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the\nwomen of the house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaecians\nused to sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons;\nand there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in\ntheir hands, raised on pedestals, to give light by night to those\nwho were at table. There are fifty maid servants in the house, some\nof whom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others\nwork at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwards\nand forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen\nis so closely woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaecians are the\nbest sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving,\nfor Minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are\nvery intelligent. \n\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about\nfour acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful trees-\npears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are luscious\nfigs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail\nall the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft\nthat a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on pear,\napple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there\nis an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the\ngrapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further\non have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others\nagain are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground\nthere are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all\nthe year round. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts\nthroughout the whole garden, while the other is carried under the\nground of the outer court to the house itself, and the town's people\ndraw water from it. Such, then, were the splendours with which the\ngods had endowed the house of king Alcinous. \n\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he\nhad looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\nprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among\nthe Phaecians making their drink-offerings to Mercury, which they\nalways did the last thing before going away for the night. He went\nstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness\nin which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\nAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and\nat that moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\nvisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition. \n\n\"Queen Arete,\" he exclaimed, \"daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress\nI humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom\nmay heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave\ntheir possessions to their children, and all the honours conferred\nupon them by the state) to help me home to my own country as soon\nas possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\"\n\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their\npeace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent\nspeaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\naddressed them thus: \n\n\"Alcinous,\" said he, \"it is not creditable to you that a stranger\nshould be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is\nwaiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise\nand take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants\nmix some wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to Jove\nthe lord of thunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under\nhis protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever\nthere may be in the house.\" \n\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from\nthe hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting\nbeside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought\nhim water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin\nfor him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him;\nan upper servant brought him bread and offered him many good things\nof what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous\nsaid to one of the servants, \"Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand\nit round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder,\nwho is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants.\" \n\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving\nevery man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings,\nand had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\n\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\nhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\nbanquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of\nhis escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing\nto his own country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no\nmatter how distant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm\nwhile on his homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will\nhave to take the luck he was born with for better or worse like other\npeople. It is possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals\nwho has come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods\nare departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made\nthemselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them hecatombs.\nThey come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves, and if\nany solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other of\nthem, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the\ngods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\" \n\nThen Ulysses said: \"Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\nnor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.\nIndeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon\nme, you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\nlet me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very importunate\nthing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice no matter how dire is\nhis distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall eat\nand drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only\non the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\nand at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content\nto die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and\nall the greatness of my house.\" \n\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that\nhe should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then\nwhen they had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much\nas he was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode,\nleaving Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the\nservants were taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first\nto speak, for she recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that\nUlysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she\nsaid, \"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should\nlike to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes?\nDid you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\" \n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate\nin full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been\nlaid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island\nfar away in the sea which is called 'the Ogygian.' Here dwells the\ncunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives\nby herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however,\nme to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with\nhis thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades\nwere drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried\nhither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during\nthe darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian\nisland where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated\nme with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal\nthat I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let\nher do so. \n\n\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the\ngood clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but\nat last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her\nown free will, either because Jove had told her she must, or because\nshe had changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which\nshe provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave\nme good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and\nfair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth\nI caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast-\nand glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was\nstill much trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would\nlet me go no further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea\nwas so terribly high that I could no longer keep to my raft, which\nwent to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I had to swim for it,\ntill wind and current brought me to your shores. \n\n\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and\nthe waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea\nand swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing\nplace, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind.\nHere, then, I got out of the water and gathered my senses together\nagain. Night was coming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket,\nwhere I covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven\nsent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept\namong the leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon,\nwhen I woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter's maid\nservants playing upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking\nlike a goddess. I besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent\ndisposition, much more so than could be expected from so young a person-\nfor young people are apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of\nbread and wine, and when she had had me washed in the river she also\ngave me the clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it\nhas pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth.\"\n\nThen Alcinous said, \"Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not\nto bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that\nshe was the first person whose aid you asked.\" \n\n\"Pray do not scold her,\" replied Ulysses; \"she is not to blame. She\ndid tell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and\nafraid, for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me.\nEvery human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.\"\n\n\"Stranger,\" replied Alcinous, \"I am not the kind of man to get angry\nabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father\nJove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you\nare, and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry\nmy daughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give\nyou a house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you\nhere against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will\nattend to-morrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep during\nthe whole voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth\nwaters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though\nit be a long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people\nwho saw it when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus\nthe son of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place- and yet they\ndid the whole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves,\nand came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships\nexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.\"\n\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, \"Father Jove, grant\nthat Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable\nname among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\"\n\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in\nthe room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs,\nand to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for\nUlysses to wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their\nhands, and when they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and\nsaid, \"Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\"\nand glad indeed was he to go to his rest. \n\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;\nbut Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his\nwife by his side. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VIII\n\nNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous\nand Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the Phaecian place\nof assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat\ndown side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took\nthe form of one of Alcinous' servants, and went round the town in\norder to help Ulysses to get home. She went up to the citizens, man\nby man, and said, \"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,\ncome to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has\njust come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks\nlike an immortal god.\" \n\nWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked\nto the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every\none was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified\nhim about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter\nthan he really was, that he might impress the Phaecians favourably\nas being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many\ntrials of skill to which they would challenge him. Then, when they\nwere got together, Alcinous spoke: \n\n\"Hear me,\" said he, \"aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,\nthat I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may\nbe, has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East\nor West. He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled.\nLet us then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before\nhim; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to\ncomplain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw\na ship into the sea- one that has never yet made a voyage- and man\nher with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you\nhave made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and\ncome to my house to prepare a feast. I will find you in everything.\nI am giving will these instructions to the young men who will form\nthe crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will\njoin me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters. I can take no\nexcuses, and we will have Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no\nbard like him whatever he may choose to sing about.\" \n\nAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a\nservant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went\nto the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they\ndrew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound\nthe oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in\ndue course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel\na little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the\nhouse of King Alcinous. The outhouses, yards, and all the precincts\nwere filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young;\nand Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and\ntwo oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent\nbanquet. \n\nA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse\nhad dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for\nthough she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed\nhim of his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests,\nleaning it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on\na peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with\nhis hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his\nside, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was\nso disposed. \n\nThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before\nthem, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse\ninspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially\na matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit, the quarrel\nbetween Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped\non one another as they gat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was\nglad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for\nApollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor\nto consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by\nthe will of Jove fell both Danaans and Trojans. \n\nThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head\nand covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see\nthat he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears\nfrom his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering\nto the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further,\nfor they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle\nover his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except\nAlcinous, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that\nhe was heaving. So he at once said, \"Aldermen and town councillors\nof the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast, and\nof the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore\nto the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be\nable to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as\nboxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners.\" \n\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A\nservant hung Demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the\ncloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the\nchief men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd\nof several thousands of people followed them, and there were many\nexcellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus,\nNauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus,\nand Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus\nson of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best looking\nman among the Phaecians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous, Laodamas,\nHalios, and Clytoneus, competed also. \n\nThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the\nstarting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew\nforward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way;\nhe left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that\na couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. They then turned to\nthe painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be the best\nman. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing\nthe disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous's\nson Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said,\nwhen they had all been diverted with the games, \"Let us ask the stranger\nwhether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully\nbuilt; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength,\nnor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is\nnothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no matter how strong\nhe is.\" \n\n\"You are quite right, Laodamas,\" replied Euryalus, \"go up to your\nguest and speak to him about it yourself.\" \n\nWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd\nand said to Ulysses, \"I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for\nsome one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of\nthem- and you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is\nnothing that does any one so much credit all his life long as the\nshowing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore\nat something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your return home\nwill not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water,\nand the crew is found.\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my mind\nis set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite\ntrouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king\nand people to further me on my return home.\" \n\nThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, \"I gather, then, that\nyou are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight\nin. I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about\nin ships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of\ntheir outward freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to\nbe much of the athlete about you.\" \n\n\"For shame, Sir,\" answered Ulysses, fiercely, \"you are an insolent\nfellow- so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in\nspeech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence,\nbut heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he\ncharms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his\nhearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows,\nand wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome\nas a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion. This\nis your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than you are,\nbut you are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly\nangry, and you are quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic\nexercises; indeed, so long as I had youth and strength, I was among\nthe first athletes of the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labour\nand sorrow, for I have gone through much both on the field of battle\nand by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will\ncompete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick.\" \n\nSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,\nlarger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians\nwhen disc-throwing among themselves. Then, swinging it back, he threw\nit from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as\nhe did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight\nas it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that\nhad been made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked\nthe place where it had fallen. \"A blind man, Sir,\" said she, \"could\neasily tell your mark by groping for it- it is so far ahead of any\nother. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian\ncan come near to such a throw as yours.\" \n\nUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,\nso he began to speak more pleasantly. \"Young men,\" said he, \"come\nup to that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy\nor even heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come\non, for I am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do\nnot care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but\nnot with him because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one's\nown personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible\nthing for a guest to challenge his host's family at any game, especially\nwhen he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under\nhis own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards any one\nelse, for I want to have the matter out and know which is the best\nman. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport known among\nmankind. I am an excellent archer. In battle I am always the first\nto bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more are taking\naim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man who could\nshoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy and in\npractice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those\nwho still eat bread upon the face of the earth, but I should not like\nto shoot against the mighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus the\nCechalian-men who could shoot against the gods themselves. This in\nfact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his end, for Apollo was angry\nwith him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. I\ncan throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow. Running\nis the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the Phaecians\nmight beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea; my provisions\nran short, and therefore I am still weak.\" \n\nThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, \"Sir, we\nhave had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from\nwhich I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having\nbeen displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to\nyou by one of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered\nby any one who knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend\nmy meaning, and will explain to any be one of your chief men who may\nbe dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we\nhave an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are\nnot particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers,\nbut we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We\nare extremely fond of good dinners, music, and dancing; we also like\nfrequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds, so now, please,\nsome of you who are the best dancers set about dancing, that our guest\non his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass\nall other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, minstrels. Demodocus\nhas left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of you and\nfetch it for him.\" \n\nOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king's house,\nand the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It\nwas their business to manage everything connected with the sports,\nso they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.\nPresently the servant came back with Demodocus's lyre, and he took\nhis place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in\nthe town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted\nwith the merry twinkling of their feet. \n\nMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and\nhow they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made\nVenus many presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, so the\nsun, who saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry\nwhen he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding\nmischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some\nchains which none could either unloose or break, so that they might\nstay there in that place. When he had finished his snare he went into\nhis bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like\ncobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling.\nNot even a god could see them, so fine and subtle were they. As soon\nas he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he\nwere setting out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all places\nin the world was the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind\nlook out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his house,\nburning with love for Venus. \n\nNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was\nabout sitting down when Mars came inside the house, an said as he\ntook her hand in his own, \"Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is\nnot at home, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech\nis barbarous.\" \n\nShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest,\nwhereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread\nfor them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found\ntoo late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them, for\nhe had turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun\ntold him what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood\nin the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the\ngods. \n\n\"Father Jove,\" he cried, \"and all you other blessed gods who live\nfor ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that\nI will show you. Jove's daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because\nI am lame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and clean built,\nwhereas I am a cripple- but my parents are to blame for that, not\nI; they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together\nasleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very\nfond of one another, but I do not think they will lie there longer\nthan they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much; there,\nhowever, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave\nhim for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not honest.\"\n\nOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling\nNeptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but\nthe goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. Then the givers\nof all good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared\nwith inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had\nbeen, whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:\n\n\"Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how\nlimping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest\ngod in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.\"\n\nThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury, \"Messenger\nMercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains\nwere, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?\" \n\n\"King Apollo,\" answered Mercury, \"I only wish I might get the chance,\nthough there were three times as many chains- and you might look on,\nall of you, gods and goddesses, but would sleep with her if I could.\"\n\nThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune\ntook it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free\nagain. \"Let him go,\" he cried, \"and I will undertake, as you require,\nthat he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among\nthe immortal gods.\" \n\n\"Do not,\" replied Vulcan, \"ask me to do this; a bad man's bond is\nbad security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should\ngo away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?\"\n\n\"Vulcan,\" said Neptune, \"if Mars goes away without paying his damages,\nI will pay you myself.\" So Vulcan answered, \"In this case I cannot\nand must not refuse you.\" \n\nThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were\nfree they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus\nto Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant\nwith burnt offerings. Here the Graces hathed her, and anointed her\nwith oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they\nclothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty. \n\nThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians\nwere charmed as they heard him. \n\nThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was\nno one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus\nhad made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw\nit up towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground\nand caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had done\nthrowing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance, and\nat the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one\nanother, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a\ngreat stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said: \n\n\"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in\nthe world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was\nastonished as I saw them.\" \n\nThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaecians \"Aldermen\nand town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of singular judgement;\nlet us give him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably\nexpect. There are twelve chief men among you, and counting myself\nthere are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean cloak, a shirt,\nand a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in a lump down\nat once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a light\nheart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\npresent too, for he has been rude.\" \n\nThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and\nsent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, \"King\nAlcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require.\nHe shall have sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is\nof silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into\nwhich it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.\" \n\nAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said,\n\"Good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss\nmay the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe\nreturn, for I understand you have been long away from home, and have\ngone through much hardship.\" \n\nTo which Ulysses answered, \"Good luck to you too my friend, and may\nthe gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword\nyou have given me along with your apology.\" \n\nWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards\nsundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants\nof the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here\nhis sons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge.\nThen Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their\nseats. \n\n\"Wife,\" said he, turning to Queen Arete, \"Go, fetch the best chest\nwe have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper\non the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath;\nsee also to the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians\nhave made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing\nthat will follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet- which\nis of exquisite workmanship- that he may be reminded of me for the\nrest of his life whenever he makes a drink-offering to Jove, or to\nany of the gods.\" \n\nThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast\nas they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to\na clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water\nbecame hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. Meanwhile\nArete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside it she\npacked all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians\nhad brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alcinous,\nand said to Ulysses: \n\n\"See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once,\nfor fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in\nyour ship.\" \n\nWhen Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast\nwith a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper\nservant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very\nglad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since\nhe left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her\nhad taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the\nservants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given\nhim a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the\nguests who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by\none of the bearing-posts supporting the roof if the cloister, and\nadmired him as she saw him pass. \"Farewell stranger,\" said she, \"do\nnot forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me first\nthat you owe a ransom for having saved your life.\" \n\nAnd Ulysses said, \"Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove\nthe mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall\nI bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved\nme.\" \n\nWhen he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was\nthen served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in\nthe favourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company,\nnear one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might\nlean against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty\nof fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant,\n\"Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it;\nfor all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the\nless; bards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the\nmuse teaches them their songs and loves them.\" \n\nThe servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who\ntook it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the\ngood things that were before them, and as soon as they had had to\neat and drink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, \"Demodocus, there is no\none in the world whom I admire more than I do you. You must have studied\nunder the Muse, Jove's daughter, and under Apollo, so accurately do\nyou sing the return of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and\nadventures. If you were not there yourself, you must have heard it\nall from some one who was. Now, however, change your song and tell\nus of the wooden horse which Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva,\nand which Ulysses got by stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting\nit with the men who afterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this\ntale aright I will tell all the world how magnificently heaven has\nendowed you.\" \n\nThe bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some\nof the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others,\nhidden within the horse, were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan place\nof assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their\nfortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and\nwere in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for breaking\nit up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the\nrock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice;\nwhile yet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation\nfor the gods. And this was how they settled it in the end, for the\ncity was doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all\nthe bravest of the Argives waiting to bring death and destruction\non the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans issued from\nthe horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their ambuscade.\nHe sang how they over ran the city hither and thither and ravaged\nit, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus to the\nhouse of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most furiously,\nnevertheless by Minerva's help he was victorious. \n\nAll this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his\ncheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws\nherself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city\nand people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children.\nShe screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping\nfor breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the\nback and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labour\nand sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks- even so piteously\ndid Ulysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except\nAlcinous, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs\nthat he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:\n\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease\nhis song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it.\nFrom the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing,\nour guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently\nin great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy\nourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should\nbe, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that\nwe are making with so much good will, are wholly in his honour, and\nany one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he\nought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.\n\n\"Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor\nreserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more\npolite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which\nyour father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which\nyou were known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is\nno one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name\nwhatever, for people's fathers and mothers give them names as soon\nas they are born. Tell me also your country, nation, and city, that\nour ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there.\nFor the Phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as\nthose of other nations have, but the ships themselves understand what\nit is that we are thinking about and want; they know all the cities\nand countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea just as\nwell even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that there is\nno danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do remember\nhearing my father say that Neptune was angry with us for being too\neasy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. He said that one\nof these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from\nhaving escorted some one, and bury our city under a high mountain.\nThis is what my used to say, but whether the god will carry out his\nthreat or no is a matter which he will decide for himself.\n\n\"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering,\nand in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples themselves,\nand of their cities- who were hostile, savage and uncivilized, and\nwho, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us also why you\nare made unhappy on hearing about the return of the Argive Danaans\nfrom Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes\nin order that future generations might have something to sing about.\nDid you lose some brave kinsman of your wife's when you were before\nTroy? a son-in-law or father-in-law- which are the nearest relations\na man has outside his own flesh and blood? or was it some brave and\nkindly-natured comrade- for a good friend is as dear to a man as his\nown brother?\" \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK IX\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear\na bard with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing\nbetter or more delightful than when a whole people make merry together,\nwith the guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded\nwith bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his\ncup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see.\nNow, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows,\nand rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know\nhow to begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the\nhand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. \n\n\"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it,\nand one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my there\nguests though I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son\nof Laertes, reknowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, so\nthat my fame ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a\nhigh mountain called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from\nit there is a group of islands very near to one another- Dulichium,\nSame, and the wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon,\nall highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie\naway from it towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave\nmen, and my eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The\ngoddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me to marry\nher, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could\nneither of them persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man\nthan his own country and his parents, and however splendid a home\nhe may have in a foreign country, if it be far from father or mother,\nhe does not care about it. Now, however, I will tell you of the many\nhazardous adventures which by Jove's will I met with on my return\nfrom Troy. \n\n\"When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which\nis the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people\nto the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided\nequitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain.\nI then said that we had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly\nwould not obey me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing\ngreat numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Cicons\ncried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were more\nin number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of\nwar, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the\noccasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as\nleaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us,\nso that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the\nships, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another.\nSo long as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held our own\nagainst them, though they were more in number than we; but as the\nsun went down, towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Cicons\ngot the better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship\nwe had; so we got away with those that were left. \n\n\"Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have\nescaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till\nwe had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished\nby the hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against\nus till it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick\nclouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships\nrun before the gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters,\nso we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest\ntowards the land. There we lay two days and two nights suffering much\nalike from toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the third\nday we again raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting\nthe wind and steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at\nthat time unharmed had not the North wind and the currents been against\nme as I was doubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by\nthe island of Cythera. \n\n\"I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the\nsea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eater,\nwho live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed\nto take in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the\nshore near the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of\nmy company to see what manner of men the people of the place might\nbe, and they had a third man under them. They started at once, and\nwent about among the Lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave\nthem to eat of the lotus, which was so delicious that those who ate\nof it left off caring about home, and did not even want to go back\nand say what had happened to them, but were for staying and munching\nlotus with the Lotus-eater without thinking further of their return;\nnevertheless, though they wept bitterly I forced them back to the\nships and made them fast under the benches. Then I told the rest to\ngo on board at once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and\nleave off wanting to get home, so they took their places and smote\nthe grey sea with their oars. \n\n\"We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land\nof the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant\nnor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley,\nand grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild\ngrapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They\nhave no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the\ntops of high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and\nthey take no account of their neighbours. \n\n\"Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not\nquite close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is\noverrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are\nnever disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen- who as a rule will\nsuffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices- do\nnot go there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it\nlies a wilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no\nliving thing upon it but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships,\nnor yet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot therefore\ngo from city to city, or sail over the sea to one another's country\nas people who have ships can do; if they had had these they would\nhave colonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yield\neverything in due season. There are meadows that in some places come\nright down to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious grass;\ngrapes would do there excellently; there is level land for ploughing,\nand it would always yield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is\ndeep. There is a good harbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet\nanchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has to do is to beach\none's vessel and stay there till the wind becomes fair for putting\nout to sea again. At the head of the harbour there is a spring of\nclear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplars growing all\nround it. \n\n\"Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have\nbrought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick\nmist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass of\nclouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked\nfor it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore\nbefore we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we\nhad beached the ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped\nupon the beach till daybreak. \n\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we admired\nthe island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove's daughters\nroused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner.\nOn this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships,\nand dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats.\nHeaven sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each\nship got nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong\nday to the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill,- and we\nhad plenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full\nwhen we sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out.\nWhile we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of\nthe Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble\nfires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating\nof their sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on\ndark, we camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.\n\n\"'Stay here, my brave fellows,' said I, 'all the rest of you, while\nI go with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if\nthey are uncivilized savages, or a hospitable and humane race.'\n\n\"I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers;\nso they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.\nWhen we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of\na cliff near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It\nwas a station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there\nwas a large yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built into\nthe ground and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of a\nhuge monster who was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He\nwould have nothing to do with other people, but led the life of an\noutlaw. He was a horrid creature, not like a human being at all, but\nresembling rather some crag that stands out boldly against the sky\non the top of a high mountain. \n\n\"I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were,\nall but the twelve best among them, who were to go along with myself.\nI also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me\nby Maron, Apollo son of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron\ngod of Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple.\nWhen we were sacking the city we respected him, and spared his life,\nas also his wife and child; so he made me some presents of great value-\nseven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars\nof sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a\nman nor maid in the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife,\nand one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water\nto one of wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so\nexquisite that it was impossible to refrain from drinking. I filled\na large skin with this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions\nwith me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to deal with some\nsavage who would be of great strength, and would respect neither right\nnor law. \n\n\"We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went\ninside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were\nloaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens\ncould hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the\nhoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very\nyoung ones all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all\nthe vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimming\nwith whey. When they saw all this, my men begged me to let them first\nsteal some cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; they would\nthen return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and\nsail away with them. It would have been indeed better if we had done\nso but I would not listen to them, for I wanted to see the owner himself,\nin the hope that he might give me a present. When, however, we saw\nhim my poor men found him ill to deal with. \n\n\"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others\nof them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with\nhis sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry\nfirewood to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with\nsuch a noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for\nfear at the far end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes\ninside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk, leaving\nthe males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled\na huge stone to the mouth of the cave- so huge that two and twenty\nstrong four-wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it from its\nplace against the doorway. When he had so done he sat down and milked\nhis ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of them have\nher own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker\nstrainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that he might drink\nit for his supper. When he had got through with all his work, he lit\nthe fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said: \n\n\"'Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or\ndo you sail the as rovers, with your hands against every man, and\nevery man's hand against you?' \n\n\"We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous\nform, but I managed to say, 'We are Achaeans on our way home from\nTroy, but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been\ndriven far out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son\nof Atreus, who has won infinite renown throughout the whole world,\nby sacking so great a city and killing so many people. We therefore\nhumbly pray you to show us some hospitality, and otherwise make us\nsuch presents as visitors may reasonably expect. May your excellency\nfear the wrath of heaven, for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes\nall respectable travellers under his protection, for he is the avenger\nof all suppliants and foreigners in distress.' \n\n\"To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said he, 'you\nare a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me,\nindeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes\ndo not care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever\nso much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your\ncompanions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for\ndoing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came\non shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the\nland?' \n\n\"He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught in\nthat way, so I answered with a lie; 'Neptune,' said I, 'sent my ship\non to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We\nwere driven on to them from the open sea, but I and those who are\nwith me escaped the jaws of death.' \n\n\"The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a\nsudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them\ndown upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains\nwere shed upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood.\nThen he tore them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled\nthem up like a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails,\nwithout leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up\nour hands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not\nknow what else to do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch,\nand had washed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk,\nhe stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep,\nand went to sleep. I was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw\nit, and drive it into his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we\nshould all certainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift\nthe stone which the monster had put in front of the door. So we stayed\nsobbing and sighing where we were till morning came. \n\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, he again\nlit his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then\nlet each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with\nall his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating\nthem for his morning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled\nthe stone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once\nput it back again- as easily as though he were merely clapping the\nlid on to a quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted,\nand cried 'Shoo, shoo,' after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain;\nso I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering\nmyself with glory. \n\n\"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows. The\nCyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;\nit was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it\nfor a staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could\nonly compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large\nburden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club\nand cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men\nand told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded\nto do, and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end\nin the fire to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under\ndung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told the men to\ncast lots which of them should venture along with myself to lift it\nand bore it into the monster's eye while he was asleep. The lot fell\nupon the very four whom I should have chosen, and I myself made five.\nIn the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and drove his\nflocks into the cave- this time driving them all inside, and not leaving\nany in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god\nmust have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back\nto its place against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his\ngoats all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one;\nwhen he had got through with all this work, he gripped up two more\nof my men, and made his supper off them. So I went up to him with\nan ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands: \n\n\"'Look here, Cyclops,' said I, you have been eating a great deal of\nman's flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what\nkind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as\na drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon\nme and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping\nand raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed yourself; how\ncan you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in\nthis way?' \n\n\"He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste\nof the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'Be so kind,'\nhe said, 'as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once.\nI want to make you a present that you will be glad to have. We have\nwine even in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens\nthem, but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.'\n\n\"I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,\nand three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when\nI saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly\nas I could: 'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give\nme, therefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this\nis what my father and mother and my friends have always called me.'\n\n\"But the cruel wretch said, 'Then I will eat all Noman's comrades\nbefore Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the\npresent that I will make him.' \n\nAs he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.\nHis great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon\nhim. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets\nof human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk.\nThen I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and\nencouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When\nthe wood, green though it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of\nthe fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven\nhad filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the\nbeam into the monster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight\nI kept turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in\na ship's plank with an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap\ncan keep on turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore\nthe red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all\nover it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the\nburning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of\nthe eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet\ninto cold water to temper it- for it is this that gives strength to\nthe iron- and it makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the\nCyclops' eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells\nmade the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, but he plucked\nthe beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and hurled it from\nhim in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so to the other\nCyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they gathered\nfrom all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked\nwhat was the matter with him. \n\n\"'What ails you, Polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such a noise,\nbreaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being\nable to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no\nman is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force? \n\n\"But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, 'Noman is killing\nme by fraud! Noman is killing me by force!' \n\n\"'Then,' said they, 'if no man is attacking you, you must be ill;\nwhen Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better\npray to your father Neptune.' \n\n\"Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my\nclever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,\nfelt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from\nthe door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front\nof it to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might\nbe foolish enough to attempt this. \n\n\"As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my\nown life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one\nwho knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great.\nIn the end I deemed that this plan would be the best. The male sheep\nwere well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them\nnoiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which\nthe wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man under the\nmiddle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that\nthere were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram\nfiner than any of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back,\nesconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and flung on patiently\nto his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the time.\n\n\"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came,\nbut when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male\nsheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about\nthe pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting;\nbut their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the\nsheep as they stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out\nthat the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was going out,\nlast of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty\nself; Polyphemus laid hold of it and said: \n\n\"'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave\nthis morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but\nlead the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain,\nand are the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last\nof all. Is it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are\nsorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him down\nin his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you\ncould understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding,\nand I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over\nthe cave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm a this\nno-good Noman has done me.' \n\n\"As spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way\nout from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly,\nand then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat,\nby constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive\nthem down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of\nus who had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops\nhad killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning\nthat they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the\nsheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took\ntheir places, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I\nhad got as far out as my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the\nCyclops. \n\n\"'Cyclops,' said I, 'you should have taken better measure of your\nman before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up\nyour visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin\nwould find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished\nyou.' \n\n\"He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from\noff a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that\nit was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked\nas the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried\nus back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But\nI snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my\nmen by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon\nthey laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were\nbefore, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged\nand prayed of me to hold my tongue. \n\n\"'Do not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough to provoke this savage creature\nfurther; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back\nagain to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us;\nif he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have pounded\nour heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks\nhe would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.'\n\n\"But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage,\n'Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and\nspoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of\nLaertes, who lives in Ithaca.' \n\n\"On this he groaned, and cried out, 'Alas, alas, then the old prophecy\nabout me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a\nman both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was\nan excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till\nhe grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day,\nand said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been\nall along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength,\nwhereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has\nmanaged to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come\nhere, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents to show my hospitality,\nand urge Neptune to help you forward on your journey- for Neptune\nand I are father and son. He, if he so will, shall heal me, which\nno one else neither god nor man can do.' \n\n\"Then I said, 'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and\nsending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take\nmore than Neptune to cure that eye of yours.' \n\n\"On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed,\nsaying, 'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true-begotten\nson, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must\nget back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight\nafter losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man's\nship and find trouble in his house.'] \n\n\"Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up\na rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with\nprodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock\nfell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards\non our way towards the shore of the island. \n\n\"When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our\nships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting\nour return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on\nto the sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops' sheep, and divided them\nequitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain. As\nfor the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra\nshare; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones\nto Jove, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and\nonly thought how he might destroy my ships and my comrades.\n\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted\nour fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came\non dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered\nDawn, appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then\nthey took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so\nwe sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death\nthough we had lost our comrades. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK X\n\nThence we went on to the Aeoli island where lives Aeolus son of Hippotas,\ndear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it were)\nupon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus has\nsix daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry the daughters,\nand they all live with their dear father and mother, feasting and\nenjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the atmosphere\nof the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats till it groans\nagain, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well-made bedsteads,\neach with his own wife between the blankets. These were the people\namong whom we had now come. \n\n\"Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the\ntime about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans.\nI told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I\nmust go, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of\ndifficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me\na prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut\nup in the hide as in a sack- for Jove had made him captain over the\nwinds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his\nown pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly\nwith a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow\nfrom any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone\nlet blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were lost\nthrough our own folly. \n\n\"Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native\nland showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the\nstubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light\nsleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we\nmight get home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among themselves,\nand said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus\nhad given me. 'Bless my heart,' would one turn to his neighbour, saying,\n'how this man gets honoured and makes friends to whatever city or\ncountry he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from Troy,\nwhile we, who have travelled just as far as he has, come back with\nhands as empty as we set out with- and now Aeolus has given him ever\nso much more. Quick- let us see what it all is, and how much gold\nand silver there is in the sack he gave him.' \n\n\"Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,\nwhereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried\nus weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke,\nand knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and\nmake the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down\nin the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore\nour fleet back to the Aeolian island. \n\n\"When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard\nby the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of\nmy men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him\nfeasting with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on\nthe threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, 'Ulysses,\nwhat brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took\ngreat pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever\nit was that you wanted to go to.' \n\n\"Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, 'My men have undone\nme; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this\nmischief, for you can if you will.' \n\n\"I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their\nfather answered, 'Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the\nisland; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for\nyou come here as one abhorred of heaven. \"And with these words he\nsent me sorrowing from his door. \n\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and\nfruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six\ndays, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached\nthe rocky stronghold of Lamus- Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians,\nwhere the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]\nsalutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers\nthe salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep might\nearn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd,\nfor they work much the same by night as they do by day. \n\n\"When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep cliffs,\nwith a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took all\ntheir ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there\nwas never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead\ncalm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very\nend of the point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but could\nsee no sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from\nthe ground. So I sent two of my company with an attendant to find\nout what sort of people the inhabitants were. \n\n\"The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the\npeople draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till\npresently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water,\nand who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was\ngoing to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their\nwater, and when my men had come close up to her, they asked her who\nthe king of that country might be, and over what kind of people he\nruled; so she directed them to her father's house, but when they got\nthere they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain,\nand they were horrified at the sight of her. \n\n\"She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly,\nand forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them,\nand began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other\ntwo ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates\nraised a hue and cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians\nsprang up from every quarter- ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks\nat us from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard\nthe horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and\nthe death cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like\nfishes and took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing\nmy men within the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own\nship, and told my men to row with alf their might if they too would\nnot fare like the rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were\nthankful enough when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks\nthey hurled at us. As for the others there was not one of them left.\n\n\"Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we\nhad lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe\nlives a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician\nAeetes- for they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is daughter\nto Oceanus. We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word,\nfor some god guided us thither, and having landed we there for two\ndays and two nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of\nthe third day came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from\nthe ship to reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human\nhandiwork, or hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high\nlook-out I espied the smoke of Circe's house rising upwards amid a\ndense forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having\nseen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more, but in\nthe end I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men their\ndinners, and send some of them instead of going myself. \n\n\"When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my\nsolitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my\npath. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the\nriver, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck\nhim in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went\nclean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life\nwent out of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the\nwound, and laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and\ntwisted them into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I\nbound the four feet of the noble creature together; having so done\nI hung him round my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon\nmy spear, for the stag was much too big for me to be able to carry\nhim on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down\nin front of the ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by\nman to each of them. 'Look here my friends,' said I, 'we are not going\nto die so much before our time after all, and at any rate we will\nnot starve so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.'\nOn this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired\nthe stag, for he was indeed a splendid fellow. Then, when they had\nfeasted their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands\nand began to cook him for dinner. \n\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed\nthere eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and\nit came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning,\nfingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, 'My friends,\nwe are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have\nno idea where the sun either sets or rises, so that we do not even\nknow East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must\ntry and find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high\nas I could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to\nthe horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising\nfrom out of a thick forest of trees.' \n\n\"Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they\nhad been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage\nogre Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was\nnothing to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies\nand set a captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while\nI took command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet,\nand the lot fell upon Eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two\nmen, and they wept, as also did we who were left behind.\n\n\"When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cut stones,\non a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest.\nThere were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it- poor\nbewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged\ninto subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great\ntails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them.\nAs hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming from dinner-\nfor they know he will bring them something- even so did these wolves\nand lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the men were\nterribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures. Presently they\nreached the gates of the goddess's house, and as they stood there\nthey could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked\nat her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colours\nas no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued\nand trusted more than any other of my men, said, 'There is some one\ninside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place\nresounds with it, let us call her and see whether she is woman or\ngoddess.' \n\n\"They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade\nthem enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus,\nwho suspected mischief and stayed outside. When she had got them into\nher house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess\nwith cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian but she drugged it with wicked\npoisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she\nturned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in\nher pigsties. They were like pigs-head, hair, and all, and they grunted\njust as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they\nremembered everything. \n\n\"Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some\nacorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back\nto tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome\nwith dismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to\ndo so; his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh,\ntill at last we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had\nhappened to the others. \n\n\"'We went,' said he, as you told us, through the forest, and in the\nmiddle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place\nthat could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was\na goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted\nto her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door,\nand invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they\nfollowed her into the house, but I stayed where I was, for I thought\nthere might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more,\nfor not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching\nfor them.' \n\n\"Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I\nalso took my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and show\nme the way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously,\nsaying, 'Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here,\nfor I know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even\nreturn alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any\nrate with the few that are left us, for we may still save our lives.'\n\n\"'Stay where you are, then, 'answered I, 'eating and drinking at the\nship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.'\n\n\"With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through\nthe charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress\nCirce, I met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man\nin the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon\nhis face. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying,\n'My poor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top,\nalone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe's\npigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not\nfancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never\nget back and will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never\nmind, I will protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take\nthis herb, which is one of great virtue, and keep it about you when\nyou go to Circe's house, it will be a talisman to you against every\nkind of mischief. \n\n\"'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will\ntry to practise upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and\nshe will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be\nable to charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you\nwill prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it.\nWhen Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon\nher as though you were goings to kill her. She will then be frightened\nand will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not point\nblank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions free, and\nto take good care also of yourself, but you make her swear solemnly\nby all the blessed that she will plot no further mischief against\nyou, or else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make\nyou fit for nothing.' \n\n\"As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed me what\nit was like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as\nmilk; the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but\nthe gods can do whatever they like. \n\n\"Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island;\nbut I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded\nwith care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there\nand called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down,\nopened the door, and asked me to come in; so I followed her- much\ntroubled in my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid\nwith silver, there was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed\na mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for\nshe meant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it\nwithout its charming me, she struck she, struck me with her wand.\n'There now,' she cried, 'be off to the pigsty, and make your lair\nwith the rest of them.' \n\n\"But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,\nwhereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously,\nsaying, 'Who and whence are you? from what place and people have you\ncome? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you? Never\nyet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I gave\nyou; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than the\nbold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here some day\nwith his ship while on his way home form Troy; so be it then; sheathe\nyour sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends and learn\nto trust each other.' \n\n\"And I answered, 'Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with\nyou when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now\nthat you have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask\nme to go to bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing.\nI shall certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will\nfirst take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.'\n\n\"So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed\nher oath then I went to bed with her. \n\n\"Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their\nwork. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the\nholy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair\npurple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another\nbrought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them with baskets\nof gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl\nand put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth she brought\nin water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which\nshe had lighted. When the water in the cauldron was boiling, she poured\ncold into it till it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in\na bath and began washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders,\nto take the tire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had\ndone washing me and anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good\ncloak and shirt and led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with\nsilver; there was a footstool also under my feet. A maid servant then\nbrought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver\nbasin for me to wash my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me;\nan upper servant brought me bread and offered me many things of what\nthere was in the house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not,\nand sat without heeding what was before me, still moody and suspicious.\n\n\"When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief,\nshe came to me and said, 'Ulysses, why do you sit like that as though\nyou were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and\ndrink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for\nI have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.'\n\n\"And I said, 'Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think\nof either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his\nfriends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink,\nyou must free my men and bring them to me that I may see them with\nmy own eyes.' \n\n\"When I had said this she went straight through the court with her\nwand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors. My men came out like\nso many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among\nthem and anointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that\nthe bad drug had given them fell off, and they became men again, younger\nthan they were before, and much taller and better looking. They knew\nme at once, seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till\nthe whole house was filled with the sound of their hullabalooing,\nand Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and\nsaid, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where\nyou have left your ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide\nall your ship's gear and property in some cave, and come back here\nwith your men.' \n\n\"I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the\nmen at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw\nme the silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves\nbreak out and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming\nhome to be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead\nresounds with their lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though\nthey had got back to their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been\nborn and bred. 'Sir,' said the affectionate creatures, 'we are as\nglad to see you back as though we had got safe home to Ithaca; but\ntell us all about the fate of our comrades.' \n\n\"I spoke comfortingly to them and said, 'We must draw our ship on\nto the land, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some\ncave; then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe's house,\nwhere you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst\nof great abundance.' \n\n\"On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried\nto hold them back and said, 'Alas, poor wretches that we are, what\nwill become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of\nCirce, who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall\nhave to keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated\nus when our comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them.\nIt was all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'\n\n\"When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen\nblade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of\nhis being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him\nand said, 'Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and mind\nthe ship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe's house.'\n\n\"On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after\nall, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand\nthat I had given him. \n\n\"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind\nwere washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them woollen\ncloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably\nat dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other face to\nface and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till\nthe whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said,\n'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men to leave off crying;\nI know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you\nhave fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now,\nso stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and\nhearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you are weakened\nboth in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking of the hardships-\nyou have suffered during your travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness\nleft in you.' \n\n\"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole\ntwelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine.\nBut when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days\nhad come round, my men called me apart and said, 'Sir, it is time\nyou began to think about going home, if so be you are to be spared\nto see your house and native country at all.' \n\n\"Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong\nday to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine,\nbut when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves\ndown to sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got\ninto bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened\nto what I had got to say. 'Circe,' said I, 'please to keep the promise\nyou made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get\nback and so do my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints\nas soon as ever your back is turned.' \n\n\"And the goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall\nnone of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there\nis another journey which you have got to take before you can sail\nhomewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine\nto consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias whose reason\nis still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding\neven in death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.'\n\n\"I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would\ngladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but presently\nwhen I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, 'And\nwho shall guide me upon this voyage- for the house of Hades is a port\nthat no ship can reach.' \n\n\"'You will want no guide,' she answered; 'raise you mast, set your\nwhite sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there\nof itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you\nwill reach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves\nof tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach\nyour ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark\nabode of Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon\nand Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron,\nand you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers\nrun into one another. \n\n\"'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench\na cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a\ndrink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then\nwine, and in the third place water-sprinkling white barley meal over\nthe whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble\nghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will\nsacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load\nthe pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that\nTeiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all\nyour flocks. \n\n\"'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers,\noffer them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus;\nbut yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards\nthe river. On this, many dead men's ghosts will come to you, and you\nmust tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just killed,\nand offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to Proserpine.\nThen draw your sword and sit there, so as to prevent any other poor\nghost from coming near the split blood before Teiresias shall have\nanswered your questions. The seer will presently come to you, and\nwill tell you about your voyage- what stages you are to make, and\nhow you are to sail the see so as to reach your home.' \n\n\"It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed\nme in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light\ngossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle\nround her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went\nabout among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly\nto each of them man by man: 'You must not lie sleeping here any longer,'\nsaid I to them, 'we must be going, for Circe has told me all about\nit.' And this they did as I bade them. \n\n\"Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We\nhad with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for\nsense or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top\naway from the rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool.\nWhen he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on\na sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so\nhe tumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul went\ndown to the house of Hades. \n\n\"When I had got the men together I said to them, 'You think you are\nabout to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead\nof this, we have got to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to\nconsult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.' \n\n\"The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves\non the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend\nmatters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting\nour fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast\nhard by the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing\nit, for who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does\nnot wish to be seen? \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XI\n\nThen, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into\nthe water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep\non board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind.\nCirce, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew\ndead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our sails all the time\nwell filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear and\nlet her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails\nwere full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went\ndown and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters\nof the river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians\nwho live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun\nnever pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of\nthe heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night.\nWhen we got there we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her,\nand went along by the waters of Oceanus till we came to the place\nof which Circe had told us. \n\n\"Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword\nand dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all\nthe dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with\nwater, and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly\nto the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I got back\nto Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best I had,\nand would load the pyre with good things. I also particularly promised\nthat Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best in all\nmy flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats\nof the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon the\nghosts came trooping up from Erebus- brides, young bachelors, old\nmen worn out with toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave\nmen who had been killed in battle, with their armour still smirched\nwith blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench\nwith a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with\nfear. When I saw them coming I told the men to be quick and flay the\ncarcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them,\nand at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine;\nbut I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor\nfeckless ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered\nmy questions. \n\n\"The first ghost 'that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he\nhad not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked\nand unburied in Circe's house, for we had had too much else to do.\nI was very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: 'Elpenor,' said\nI, 'how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have\nhere on foot quicker than I have with my ship.' \n\n\"'Sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all bad luck, and my own\nunspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe's\nhouse, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase\nbut fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul down to\nthe house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have\nleft behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father\nwho brought you up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is\nthe one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that\nwhen you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean\nisland. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you,\nor I may bring heaven's anger upon you; but burn me with whatever\narmour I have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell\npeople in days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant\nover my grave the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and\nwith my messmates.' And I said, 'My poor fellow, I will do all that\nyou have asked of me.' \n\n\"Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the\none side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the\nghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then\ncame the ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus.\nI had left her alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears\nwhen I saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her\ncome near the blood till I had asked my questions of Teiresias.\n\n\"Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre\nin his hand. He knew me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,\nwhy, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit\nthe dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw\nyour sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your questions\ntruly.' \n\n\"So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank\nof the blood he began with his prophecy. \n\n\"You want to know,' said he, 'about your return home, but heaven will\nmake this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye\nof Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having\nblinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home if you\ncan restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the\nThrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging\nto the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. If you leave these\nflocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting home, you may\nyet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I\nforewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men.\nEven though you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight\nafter losing all your men, [in another man's ship, and you will find\ntrouble in your house, which will be overrun by high-handed people,\nwho are devouring your substance under the pretext of paying court\nand making presents to your wife. \n\n\"'When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and\nafter you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you\nmust take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to\na country where the people have never heard of the sea and do not\neven mix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about ships,\nand oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain\ntoken which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and\nwill say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your\nshoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice\na ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune. Then go home and offer hecatombs\nto an the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death\nshall come to you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very\ngently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your people\nshall bless you. All that I have said will come true].' \n\n\"'This,' I answered, 'must be as it may please heaven, but tell me\nand tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother's ghost close by\nus; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though\nI am her own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me,\nSir, how I can make her know me.' \n\n\"'That,' said he, 'I can soon do Any ghost that you let taste of the\nblood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not\nlet them have any blood they will go away again.' \n\n\"On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for\nhis prophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was\nuntil my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at\nonce and spoke fondly to me, saying, 'My son, how did you come down\nto this abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard\nthing for the living to see these places, for between us and them\nthere are great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no\nman can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are\nyou all this time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have\nyou never yet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?'\n\n\"'Mother,' said I, 'I was forced to come here to consult the ghost\nof the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean\nland nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but\none long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set\nout with Agamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the\nTrojans. But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did\nyou have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy\npassage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the son whom\nI left behind me; is my property still in their hands, or has some\none else got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim\nit? Tell me again what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she\nis; does she live with my son and guard my estate securely, or has\nshe made the best match she could and married again?' \n\n\"My mother answered, 'Your wife still remains in your house, but she\nis in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both\nnight and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property,\nand Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain\nlargely, as of course he must, considering his position as a magistrate,\nand how every one invites him; your father remains at his old place\nin the country and never goes near the town. He has no comfortable\nbed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of\nthe fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when\nthe warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a\nbed of vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground. He grieves continually\nabout your never having come home, and suffers more and more as he\ngrows older. As for my own end it was in this wise: heaven did not\ntake me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was I attacked\nby any illness such as those that generally wear people out and kill\nthem, but my longing to know what you were doing and the force of\nmy affection for you- this it was that was the death of me.'\n\n\"Then I tried to find some way of embracing my mother's ghost. Thrice\nI sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each time\nshe flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and being\ntouched to the quick I said to her, 'Mother, why do you not stay still\nwhen I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms around one another\nwe might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in the\nhouse of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of\ngrief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?' \n\n\"'My son,' she answered, 'most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not\nProserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when\nthey are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;\nthese perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has\nleft the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream.\nNow, however, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and\nnote all these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.'\n\n\"Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the\nwives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds\nabout the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally.\nIn the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that\nhung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood\nat once. So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned\nher told me her race and lineage. \n\n\"The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife\nof Cretheus the son of Aeolus. She fell in love with the river Enipeus\nwho is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when\nshe was taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as\nher lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue\nwave arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and\ngod, whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.\nWhen the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in\nhis own and said, 'Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of\nthe gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this\ntime twelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now\ngo home, but hold your tongue and do not tell any one.' \n\n\"Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and\nNeleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias\nwas a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived\nin Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson,\nPheres, and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.\n\n\"Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of\nhaving slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two\nsons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates,\nand built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could\nnot hold Thebes till they had walled it. \n\n\"Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove\nindomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,\nand married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon. \n\n\"I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king OEdipodes whose awful lot\nit was to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her\nafter having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole\nstory to the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief\nfor the spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house\nof the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the\navenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother- to his ruing\nbitterly thereafter. \n\n\"Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given\npriceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son\nof Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She\nbore Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that marvellously\nlovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus\nwould only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles\nfrom the grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The\nonly man who would undertake to raid them was a certain excellent\nseer, but the will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the\ncattle caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full\nyear had passed and the same season came round again, Iphicles set\nhim at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven.\nThus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished. \n\n\"And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons,\nCastor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these\nheroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for\nby a special dispensation of Jove, they die and come to life again,\neach one of them every other day throughout all time, and they have\nthe rank of gods. \n\n\"After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace\nof Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short\nlived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,\nand the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they\nwere nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest.\nThey threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried to\nset Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the\ntop of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would have\ndone it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed\nboth of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their\ncheeks or chin. \n\n\"Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the\nmagician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens,\nbut he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her\nin the island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.\n\n\"I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own\nhusband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name\nevery single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw,\nand it is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew,\nor here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.\"\n\nHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless\nthroughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:\n\n\"What do you think of this man, O Phaecians? Is he not tall and good\nlooking, and is he not Clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of\nyou share in the distinction. Do not he a hurry to send him away,\nnor niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great\nneed, for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.\"\n\nThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among\nthem, \"My friends,\" said he, \"what our august queen has just said\nto us is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded\nby it; but the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with\nKing Alcinous.\" \n\n\"The thing shall be done,\" exclaimed Alcinous, \"as surely as I still\nlive and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious\nto get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow,\nby which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum that I\nmean to give him. As regards- his escort it will be a matter for you\nall, and mine above all others as the chief person among you.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay\nhere for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded\nwith your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would redound\ngreatly to my advantage, for I should return fuller-handed to my own\npeople, and should thus be more respected and beloved by all who see\nme when I get back to Ithaca.\" \n\n\"Ulysses,\" replied Alcinous, \"not one of us who sees you has any idea\nthat you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people\ngoing about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to\nsee through them, but there is a style about your language which assures\nme of your good disposition. Moreover you have told the story of your\nown misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practised\nbard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty\nheroes who went to Troy at the same time with yourself, and perished\nthere. The evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet\nbed time- go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay\nhere listening till to-morrow morning, so long as you will continue\nto tell us of your adventures.\" \n\n\"Alcinous,\" answered Ulysses, \"there is a time for making speeches,\nand a time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you so desire, I\nwill not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of\nmy comrades who did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but perished\non their return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.\n\n\"When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions,\nthe ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up tome, surrounded\nby those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon\nas he had tasted the blood he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched\nout his arms towards me to embrace me; but he had no strength nor\nsubstance any more, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him.\n'How did you come by your death,' said I, 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune\nraise his winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did\nyour enemies make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting\nor sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of their\nwives and city?' \n\n\"'Ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of Laertes, was not lost at sea\nin any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon\nthe mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me\nbetween them. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered\nme most miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house,\nwhile all around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for\nthe wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great\nnobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general\nengagement, or in single combat, but you never saw anything so truly\npitiable as the way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing-bowl\nand the loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with\nour-blood. I heard Priam's daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra\nkilled her close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword\nin my body, and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but\nshe slipped away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my\neyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world so cruel\nand so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as\nhers was. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to\nbe welcomed home by my children and my servants, but her abominable\ncrime has brought disgrace on herself and all women who shall come\nafter- even on the good ones.' \n\n\"And I said, 'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first\nto last in the matter of their women's counsels. See how many of us\nfell for Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched\nmischief against too during your absence.' \n\n\"'Be sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, 'and not be too friendly\neven with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly\nwell yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about\nthe rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for\nPenelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We\nleft her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out\nfor Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man's estate,\nand he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another\nas it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not even\nallow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I\ncould do so. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to your heart- do\nnot tell people when you are bringing your ship to Ithaca, but steal\na march upon them, for after all this there is no trusting women.\nBut now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my\nson Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta\nwith Menelaus- for I presume that he is still living.' \n\n\"And I said, 'Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether\nyour son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does\nnot know.' \n\n\"As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the\nghost of Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax\nwho was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the\nson of Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously,\nsaying, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will you\nundertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hades among\nus silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labour no more?'\n\n\"And I said, 'Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans,\nI came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me about my\nreturn home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get near\nthe Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have been\nin trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet\nso fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored\nby all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are\nhere you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take\nit so much to heart even if you are dead.' \n\n\"'Say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; I would rather\nbe a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king\nof kings among the dead. But give me news about son; is he gone to\nthe wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me\nalso if you have heard anything about my father Peleus- does he still\nrule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout\nHellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could\nI but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same strength\nthat I had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of\nTroy- could I but be as I then was and go even for a short time to\nmy father's house, any one who tried to do him violence or supersede\nhim would soon me it.' \n\n\"'I have heard nothing,' I answered, 'of Peleus, but I can tell you\nall about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from\nScyros with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was\nalways first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and\nI were the only two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting\non the plain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men,\nbut would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many\na man did he kill in battle- I cannot name every single one of those\nwhom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only\nsay how he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus, who\nwas the handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also\nof the Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman's bribes. Moreover,\nwhen all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus\nhad made, and it was left to me to settle when we should either open\nthe door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders\nand chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking\nin every limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from\nhis cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the horse-\ngrasping the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing\nfury against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he\ngot his handsome share of the prize money and went on board (such\nis the fortune of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown\nspear nor in close combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great\nchance.' \n\n\"When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across\na meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning\nthe prowess of his son. \n\n\"The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own\nmelancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof-\nstill angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about\nthe armour of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the\nTrojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never\ngained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who\nwas foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in\nstature and prowess. \n\n\"When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, 'Ajax, will you not\nforget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that\nhateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough\nto lose such a tower of strength as you were to us. We mourned you\nas much as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the\nblame be laid on anything but on the spite which Jove bore against\nthe Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel your destruction-\ncome hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection, and\nhear what I can tell you.' \n\n\"He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts;\nnevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being\nso angry, or I should have gone talking to him, only that there were\nstill others among the dead whom I desired to see. \n\n\"Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand\nsitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting\nand standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his\nsentences upon them. \n\n\"After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the\nghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and\nhe had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.\n\n\"And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering\nsome nine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were\ndigging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat\nthem off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove's\nmistress Leto as she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.\n\n\"I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that\nreached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could never\nreach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink,\nit dried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry ground-\nparched by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees, moreover, that\nshed their fruit over his head- pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet\nfigs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched out\nhis hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back again to\nthe clouds. \n\n\"And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone\nwith both his hands. With hands and feet he' tried to roll it up to\nthe top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over\non to the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and the\npitiless stone would come thundering down again on to the plain. Then\nhe would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran\noff him and the steam rose after him. \n\n\"After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for\nhe is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to\nwife, who is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming\nround him like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as\nnight with his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string,\nglaring around as though ever on the point of taking aim. About his\nbreast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous\nfashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there\nwas also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what\nhe might, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knew\nme at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, my poor Ulysses,\nnoble son of Laertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind of life\nthat I did when I was above ground? I was son of Jove, but I went\nthrough an infinity of suffering, for I became bondsman to one who\nwas far beneath me- a low fellow who set me all manner of labours.\nHe once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound- for he did not think\nhe could find anything harder for me than this, but I got the hound\nout of Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped\nme.' \n\n\"On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed\nwhere I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me.\nAnd I should have seen still other of them that are gone before, whom\nI would fain have seen- Theseus and Pirithous glorious children of\nthe gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered\nsuch appalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest Proserpine should\nsend up from the house of Hades the head of that awful monster Gorgon.\nOn this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board\nat once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places,\nwhereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We had\nto row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XII\n\n\"After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into the\nopen sea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there\nis dawn and sunrise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to\nthe sands and got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep\nand waited till day should break. \n\n\"Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I\nsent some men to Circe's house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut\nfirewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and\nafter we had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral\nrites. When his body and armour had been burned to ashes, we raised\na cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed\nthe oar that he had been used to row with. \n\n\"While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got back\nfrom the house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast as\nshe could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread,\nmeat, and wine. Then she stood in the midst of us and said, 'You have\ndone a bold thing in going down alive to the house of Hades, and you\nwill have died twice, to other people's once; now, then, stay here\nfor the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on with your voyage\nat daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses\nabout your course, and will explain everything to him so as to prevent\nyour suffering from misadventure either by land or sea.'\n\n\"We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong\nday to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it\ncame on dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables\nof the ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated\naway from the others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all\nabout our adventures. \n\n\"'So far so good,' said she, when I had ended my story, 'and now pay\nattention to what I am about to tell you- heaven itself, indeed, will\nrecall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens\nwho enchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too\nclose and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will\nnever welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble\nhim to death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap\nof dead men's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting\noff them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears\nwith wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen\nyourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright\non a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they must lash the rope's\nends to the mast itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening.\nIf you beg and pray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you\nfaster. \n\n\"'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you\ncoherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; I\nwill lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them\nfor yourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against\nwhich the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the\nblessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird\nmay pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father\nJove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father\nJove has to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever\nyet came to these rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds\nof fire are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men.\nThe only vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the famous Argo\non her way from the house of Aetes, and she too would have gone against\nthese great rocks, only that Juno piloted her past them for the love\nshe bore to Jason. \n\n\"'Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in\na dark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never clear\nnot even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands\nand twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs\nsheer up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle\nof it there is a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus;\nyou must take your ship this way, but the cave is so high up that\nnot even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it\nScylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be that\nof a young hound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one-\nnot even a god- could face her without being terror-struck. She has\ntwelve mis-shapen feet, and six necks of the most prodigious length;\nand at the end of each neck she has a frightful head with three rows\nof teeth in each, all set very close together, so that they would\ncrunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep within her\nshady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,\nfishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can\ncatch, of the thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever\nyet got past her without losing some men, for she shoots out all her\nheads at once, and carries off a man in each mouth. \n\n\"'You will find the other rocks lie lower, but they are so close together\nthat there is not more than a bowshot between them. [A large fig tree\nin full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking whirlpool\nof Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her waters,\nand three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not there\nwhen she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not save\nyou; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you\ncan, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.'\n\n\"'Is there no way,' said I, 'of escaping Charybdis, and at the same\ntime keeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?'\n\n\"'You dare-devil,' replied the goddess, you are always wanting to\nfight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even\nby the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage,\nextreme, rude, cruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your\nbest chance will be to get by her as fast as ever you can, for if\nyou dawdle about her rock while you are putting on your armour, she\nmay catch you with a second cast of her six heads, and snap up another\nhalf dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at full speed,\nand roar out lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla's dam, bad luck to\nher; she will then stop her from making a second raid upon you.\n\n\"'You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see\nmany herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god-\nseven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in\neach flock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number,\nand they are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who are\nchildren of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she\nhad borne them and had done suckling them sent them to the Thrinacian\nisland, which was a long way off, to live there and look after their\nfather's flocks and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and\nthink of nothing but getting home, you may yet after much hardship\nreach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction\nboth of your ship and of your comrades; and even though you may yourself\nescape, you will return late, in bad plight, after losing all your\nmen.' \n\n\"Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,\nwhereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men\nto loose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her,\ntook their places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars.\nPresently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a\nfair wind that blew dead aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping\nour sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's\ngear, and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her. \n\n\"Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, 'My friends,\nit is not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies\nthat Circe has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, so that\nwhether we live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First she\nsaid we were to keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most beautifully\nin a field of flowers; but she said I might hear them myself so long\nas no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind me to the crosspiece\nhalf way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so fast\nthat I cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope's ends to the\nmast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more\ntightly still.' \n\n\"I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we reached\nthe island of the two Sirens, for the wind had been very favourable.\nThen all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of\nwind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the sails and\nstowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened the water with\nthe foam they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of\nwax and cut it up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my\nstrong hands till it became soft, which it soon did between the kneading\nand the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears\nof all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to the mast as I stood\nupright on the crosspiece; but they went on rowing themselves. When\nwe had got within earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a\ngood rate, the Sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began\nwith their singing. \n\n\"'Come here,' they sang, 'renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean\nname, and listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without\nstaying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song- and he who listens\nwill go on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know all the\nills that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before Troy,\nand can tell you everything that is going to happen over the whole\nworld.' \n\n\"They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear them\nfurther I made by frowning to my men that they should set me free;\nbut they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes bound\nme with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the\nSirens' voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and unbound\nme. \n\n\"Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from\nwhich spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men\nwere so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole\nsea resounded with the rushing of the waters, but the ship stayed\nwhere it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore,\nand exhorted them man by man not to lose heart. \n\n\"'My friends,' said I, 'this is not the first time that we have been\nin danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops\nshut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel\nsaved us then, and we shall live to look back on all this as well.\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row on with\nmight and main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend\nto them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these\nsteaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and\nbe over yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the\ndeath of us.' \n\n\"So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster\nScylla, for I knew the men would not on rowing if I did, but would\nhuddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe's\nstrict instructions- I put on my armour. Then seizing two strong spears\nI took my stand on the ship Is bows, for it was there that I expected\nfirst to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my men so much\nharm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though I strained my\neyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over \n\n\"Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one\nhand was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up\nthe salt water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron\nwhen it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the\ntop of the rocks on either side. When she began to suck again, we\ncould see the water all inside whirling round and round, and it made\na deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We could see the\nbottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were\nat their wit's ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and\nwere expecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly\nupon us and snatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after\nboth ship and men, and in a moment I saw their hands and feet ever\nso high above me, struggling in the air as Scylla was carrying them\noff, and I heard them call out my name in one last despairing cry.\nAs a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some jutting rock throws\nbait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes, and spears\nthem with the ox's horn with which his spear is shod, throwing them\ngasping on to the land as he catches them one by one- even so did\nScylla land these panting creatures on her rock and munch them up\nat the mouth of her den, while they screamed and stretched out their\nhands to me in their mortal agony. This was the most sickening sight\nthat I saw throughout all my voyages. \n\n\"When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible\nCharybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were\nthe goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still\nat sea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing as they came home\nto the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the blind\nTheban prophet Teiresias had told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe\nhad warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god. So being\nmuch troubled I said to the men, 'My men, I know you are hard pressed,\nbut listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and\nhow carefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed\nsun-god, for it was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie.\nHead the ship, therefore, away from the island.' \n\n\"The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an\ninsolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very\nstrong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,\nand now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep,\nyou will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon\nthis island, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly\non through the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the\nwinds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should\none of those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which\nso often wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious?\nNow, therefore, let us obey the of night and prepare our supper here\nhard by the ship; to-morrow morning we will go on board again and\nput out to sea.' \n\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that\nheaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me to yield, for you\nare many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his\nsolemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock\nof sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either,\nbut will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.'\n\n\"They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their\noath we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of\nfresh water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As\nsoon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they began talking about\ntheir poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set\nthem weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound\nsleep. \n\n\"In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their\nplaces, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so\nthat land and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang\nforth out of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered\nDawn, appeared, we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave\nwherein the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called\nthe men together in council. \n\n\"'My friends,' said I, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let us\nmind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for\nit; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees\nand gives ear to everything. And again they promised that they would\nobey. \n\n\"For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there\nwas no other wind, but only South and East. As long as corn and wine\nheld out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,\nhowever, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced\nto go further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking\nwhatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One\nday, therefore, I went up inland that I might pray heaven to show\nme some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough to be clear\nof all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from\nthe wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus\ntill by and by they sent me off into a sweet sleep. \n\n\"Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men, 'Listen\nto me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but\nthere is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best\nof these cows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal Rods? If\nwe ever get back to Ithaca, we can build a fine temple to the sun-god\nand enrich it with every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined\nto sink our ship out of revenge for these homed cattle, and the other\ngods are of the same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water\nonce for all and have done with it, than be starved to death by inches\nin such a desert island as this is.' \n\n\"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle,\nso fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men, therefore\ndrove in the best of them, and they all stood round them saying their\nprayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there\nwas no barley left. When they had done praying they killed the cows\nand dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped\nthem round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on\ntop of them. They had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over\nthe sacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little\nwater from time to time while the inward meats were being grilled;\nthen, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward\nmeats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits.\n\n\"By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the\nship and to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast\nmeat, so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. 'Father Jove,'\nI exclaimed, 'and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss,\nyou have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have\nsent me; see what fine work these men of mine have been making in\nmy absence.' \n\n\"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had\nbeen killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said\nto the immortals, 'Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in\neverlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses' ship:\nthey have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing\nI loved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again.\nIf they do not square accounts with me about my cows, I will go down\nto Hades and shine there among the dead.' \n\n\"'Sun,' said Jove, 'go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over\nthe fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with\na bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.'\n\n\"I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from the\nmouth of Mercury. \n\n\"As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked each\none of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for\nthe cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to show\nsigns and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about,\nand the joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the meat,\nwhether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.\n\n\"For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon\nthem, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the\nfury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts,\nspread sail, and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from\nthe island, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturn\nraised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath\nit. We not get on much further, for in another moment we were caught\nby a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of the\nmast so that it fell aft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about\nat the bottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman\nin the ship's stern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to\npieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving, with no more\nlife left in him. \n\n\"Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round\nand round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning\nstruck it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about\nin the water round the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but the\ngod presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again.\n\n\"I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel\n(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in\nthe direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong\nstill hanging about it, and with this I lashed the mast and keel together,\nand getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to\ntake me. \n\n\"[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got\ninto the South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back\nto the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually\nhappened, for I was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise\nhad reacfied the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking\ndown the salt sea water, but I was carried aloft toward the fig tree,\nwhich I caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not plant\nmy feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a long\nway off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too high,\ntoo vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung patiently\non, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft again-\nand a very long while it seemed. A juryman is not more glad to get\nhome to supper, after having been long detained in court by troublesome\ncases, than I was to see my raft beginning to work its way out of\nthe whirlpool again. At last I let go with my hands and feet, and\nfell heavily into the sea, bard by my raft on to which I then got,\nand began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the father of gods\nand men would not let her get further sight of me- otherwise I should\nhave certainly been lost.] \n\n\"Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the\ngods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and\npowerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I\nneed say no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all\nabout it yesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and over\nagain.\" \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XIII\n\nThus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered\ncloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous\nbegan to speak. \n\n\"Ulysses,\" said he, \"now that you have reached my house I doubt not\nyou will get home without further misadventure no matter how much\nyou have suffered in the past. To you others, however, who come here\nnight after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard,\nI would insist as follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes,\nwrought gold, and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;\nlet us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a\nlarge tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy\nof a general rate; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear\nthe burden of such a handsome present.\" \n\nEvery one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in\nhis own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,\nthey hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.\nAlcinous went on board and saw everything so securely stowed under\nthe ship's benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the\nrowers. Then they went to the house of Alcinous to get dinner, and\nhe sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove who is the lord of\nall. They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner, after\nwhich the inspired bard, Demodocus, who was a favourite with every\none, sang to them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the\nsun, as though to hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on\nhis way. As one who has been all day ploughing a fallow field with\na couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when\nnight comes that he may go and get it, for it is all his legs can\ndo to carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down,\nand he at once said to the Phaecians, addressing himself more particularly\nto King Alcinous: \n\n\"Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send\nme on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire by\ngiving me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that\nI may turn to good account; may I find my admirable wife living in\npeace among friends, and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction\nto your wives and children; may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace,\nand may no evil thing come among your people.\" \n\nThus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and\nagreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably.\nAlcinous therefore said to his servant, \"Pontonous, mix some wine\nand hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to father\nJove, and speed our guest upon his way.\" \n\nPontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others\neach from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that\nlive in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the\nhands of queen Arete. \n\n\"Farewell, queen,\" said he, \"henceforward and for ever, till age and\ndeath, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now\ntake my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people,\nand with king Alcinous.\" \n\nAs he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to conduct\nhim to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some maid servants\nwith him- one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his strong-box,\nand a third with corn and wine. When they got to the water side the\ncrew took these things and put them on board, with all the meat and\ndrink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck\nthat he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship. Then he too\nwent on board and lay down without a word, but the crew took every\nman his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone to which\nit had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing out to sea, Ulysses\nfell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber. \n\nThe ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies\nover the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curveted as\nit were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water\nseethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a falcon,\nswiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus, then,\nshe cut her way through the water. carrying one who was as cunning\nas the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all\nthat he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves\nof the weary sea. \n\nWhen the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show.\nthe ship drew near to land. Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the\nold merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the line\nof the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms\nof wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within it, a\nship may lie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour\nthere is a large olive tree, and at no distance a fine overarching\ncavern sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. There are mixing-bowls\nwithin it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover,\nthere are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes\nof sea purple- very curious to see- and at all times there is water\nwithin it. It has two entrances, one facing North by which mortals\ncan go down into the cave, while the other comes from the South and\nis more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the\nway taken by the gods. \n\nInto this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the place,\nShe had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length on to\nthe shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thing they did\nwas to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the ship,\nand lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took out\nthe presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him\nwhen he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all\ntogether by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear\nsome passer by might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and\nthen they made the best of their way home again. \n\nBut Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already threatened\nUlysses, so he took counsel with Jove. \"Father Jove,\" said he, \"I\nshall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods, if\nmortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show\nsuch small regard for me. I said I would Ulysses get home when he\nhad suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never get\nhome at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head about it,\nand promised that he should do so; but now they have brought him in\na ship fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him\nwith more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he\nwould ever have brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of\nthe spoil and got home without misadventure.\" \n\nAnd Jove answered, \"What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking\nabout? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would\nbe monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are.\nAs regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence\nand treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself\nto deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as you please.\"\n\n\"I should have done so at once,\" replied Neptune, \"if I were not anxious\nto avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I should\nlike to wreck the Phaecian ship as it is returning from its escort.\nThis will stop them from escorting people in future; and I should\nalso like to bury their city under a huge mountain.\" \n\n\"My good friend,\" answered Jove, \"I should recommend you at the very\nmoment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her\nway, to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship.\nThis will astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under\nthe mountain.\" \n\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where\nthe Phaecians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making\nrapid way, had got close-in. Then he went up to it, turned it into\nstone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it\nin the ground. After this he went away. \n\nThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would\nturn towards his neighbour, saying, \"Bless my heart, who is it that\ncan have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port?\nWe could see the whole of her only moment ago.\" \n\nThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous\nsaid, \"I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that\nNeptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over\nthe sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning\nfrom an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain. This was\nwhat my old father used to say, and now it is all coming true. Now\ntherefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave\noff giving people escorts when they come here, and in the next let\nus sacrifice twelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy\nupon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain.\" When the\npeople heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls.\n\nThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaecians to king Neptune, standing\nround his altar; and at the same time Ulysses woke up once more upon\nhis own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again;\nmoreover, Jove's daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that\npeople might not know of his having come, and that she might tell\nhim everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and\nfriends recognizing him until he had taken his revenge upon the wicked\nsuitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him- the\nlong straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the goodly\ntrees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native\nland. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried\naloud despairingly. \n\n\"Alas,\" he exclaimed, \"among what manner of people am I fallen? Are\nthey savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane? Where shall\nI put all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had stayed\nover there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other\ngreat chief who would have been good to me and given me an escort.\nAs it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave\nit here for fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good truth\nthe chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly\nby me, and have left me in the wrong country; they said they would\ntake me back to Ithaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector\nof suppliants chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes\nthose who do wrong. Still, I suppose I must count my goods and see\nif the crew have gone off with any of them.\" \n\nHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his\nclothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about\nnot being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore\nof the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up\nto him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien,\nwith a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals\non her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad\nwhen he saw her, and went straight up to her. \n\n\"My friend,\" said he, \"you are the first person whom I have met with\nin this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be will disposed\ntowards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace\nyour knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me, then,\nand tell me truly, what land and country is this? Who are its inhabitants?\nAm I on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?\"\n\nMinerva answered, \"Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have\ncome from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this\nis. It is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and\nWest. It is rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no\nmeans a bid island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity\nof corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it\nbreeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there\nare watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name\nof Ithaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a\nlong way off from this Achaean country.\" \n\nUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own\ncountry, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and\nmade up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.\n\n\"I heard of Ithaca,\" said he, \"when I was in Crete beyond the seas,\nand now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have\nleft as much more behind me for my children, but am flying because\nI killed Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete.\nI killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from\nTroy with so much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and\nby the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served his father\nloyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent\nruler, so I lay in wait for him and with one of my followers by the\nroad side, and speared him as he was coming into town from the country.\nmy It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore,\nthat I had killed him, but as soon as I had done so I went to a ship\nand besought the owners, who were Phoenicians, to take me on board\nand set me in Pylos or in Elis where the Epeans rule, giving them\nas much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile, but the wind\ndrove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither\nby night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none\nof us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all\nwent on shore and lay down just as we were. I was very tired and fell\nasleep directly, so they took my goods out of the ship, and placed\nthem beside me where I was lying upon the sand. Then they sailed away\nto Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress of mind.\"\n\nSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand.\nThen she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, \"He must\nbe indeed a shifty lying fellow,\" said she, \"who could surpass you\nin all manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist.\nDare-devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can\nyou not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now\nthat you are in your own country again? We will say no more, however,\nabout this, for we can both of us deceive upon occasion- you are the\nmost accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I\nfor diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not\nknow Jove's daughter Minerva- me, who have been ever with you, who\nkept watch over you in all your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians\ntake so great a liking to you? And now, again, I am come here to talk\nthings over with you, and help you to hide the treasure I made the\nPhaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the troubles that await\nyou in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell no one,\nneither man nor woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything,\nand put up with every man's insolence, without a word.\" \n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but\nyou are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets\nyou it is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not.\nThis much, however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to\nme as long as we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the\nday on which we went on board ship after having sacked the city of\nPriam, and heaven dispersed us- from that day, Minerva, I saw no more\nof you, and cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me\nin a difficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered\nme from evil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged\nme and took me into the town. And now, I beseech you in your father's\nname, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in\nIthaca. I am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving\nme in all you have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really\ngot back to my own country?\" \n\n\"You are always taking something of that sort into your head,\" replied\nMinerva, \"and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions;\nyou are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning\nfrom so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife\nand children, but you do not seem to care about asking after them\nor hearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife,\nwho remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no peace night\nor day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming\nnear you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would\nget back safely though you would lose all your men, and I did not\nwish to quarrel with my uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having\nblinded his son. I will now, however, point out to you the lie of\nthe land, and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven\nof the old merman Phorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at\nthe head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;] here too\nis the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable\nhecatomb to the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.\"\n\nAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared.\nThen Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and\nkissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the\nnymphs, saying, \"Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that\nI was never again to see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving\nsalutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if\nJove's redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to\nmanhood.\" \n\n\"Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,\" rejoined Minerva,\n\"let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave,\nwhere they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it\nall.\" \n\nTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding\nplaces, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze,\nand good clothing which the Phaecians had given him. They stowed everything\ncarefully away, and Minerva set a stone against the door of the cave.\nThen the two sat down by the root of the great olive, and consulted\nhow to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors. \n\n\"Ulysses,\" said Minerva, \"noble son of Laertes, think how you can\nlay hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in\nyour house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding\npresents to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving\nhope and sending your encouraging messages to every one of them, but\nmeaning the very opposite of all she says' \n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have\ncome to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if\nyou had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall\nbest avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my\nheart as on the day when we loosed Troy's fair diadem from her brow.\nHelp me now as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if\nyou, goddess, will be with me.\" \n\n\"Trust me for that,\" said she, \"I will not lose sight of you when\nonce we set about it, and I would imagine that some of those who are\ndevouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their\nblood and brains. I will begin by disguising you so that no human\nbeing shall know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall\nlose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall\nfill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for\nyou, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors,\nof your wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then go at\nonce to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been always\nwell affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son;\nyou will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is called Raven\nby the fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening on beechmast and\nspring water after their manner. Stay with him and find out how things\nare going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your son, who is with\nMenelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out whether\nyou are still alive.\" \n\n\"But why,\" said Ulysses, \"did you not tell him, for you knew all about\nit? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship\nwhile others are eating up his estate?\" \n\nMinerva answered, \"Never mind about him, I sent him that he might\nbe well spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty,\nbut is staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded\nwith abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and\nare lying in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can\nget home. I do not much think they will succeed, but rather that some\nof those who are now eating up your estate will first find a grave\nthemselves.\" \n\nAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with\nwrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over\nhis whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine\nones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about\nhim, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also\ngave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished\nhim with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for\nhim to sling it over his shoulder. \n\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess\nwent straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XIV\n\nUlysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the\nwooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached\nthe place where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd,\nwho was the most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front\nof his hut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which\ncould be seen from far. He had made them spacious and fair to see,\nwith a free ran for the pigs all round them; he had built them during\nhis master's absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,\nwithout saying anything to Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced\nthem on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong\nfence of oaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while\ninside lie had built twelve sties near one another for the sows to\nlie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in each sty, all of them breeding\nsows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for\nthe suitors kept on eating them, and die swineherd had to send them\nthe best he had continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar\npigs, and the herdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves,\nslept always with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out\na pair of sandals from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were\nout herding the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the\nfourth to town with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors\nthat they might sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\n\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew\nat him, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold\nof the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn\nby them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox\nhide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the\ndogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to\nUlysses, \"Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work of\nyou, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have given\nme quite enough worries without that, for I have lost the best of\nmasters, and am in continual grief on his account. I have to attend\nswine for other people to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the\nlight of day, is starving in some distant land. But come inside, and\nwhen you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where you come\nfrom, and all about your misfortunes.\" \n\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down.\nHe strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top\nof this he threw the shaggy chamois skin- a great thick one- on which\nhe used to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus\nwelcome, and said \"May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you\nyour heart's desire in return for the kind way in which you have received\nme.\" \n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Stranger, though a still\npoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult\nhim, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what\nyou can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have\nyoung lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for\nheaven has hindered the return of him who would have been always good\nto me and given me something of my own- a house, a piece of land,\na good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant\nwho has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered\nas they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had\ngrown old here he would have done great things by me, but he is gone,\nand I wish that Helen's whole race were utterly destroyed, for she\nhas been the death of many a good man. It was this matter that took\nmy master to Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans\nin the cause of kin Agamemnon.\" \n\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the sties where\nthe young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought\nback with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted\non them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it\nbefore Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled\nit over with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a\nbowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin.\n\n\"Fall to, stranger,\" said he, \"on a dish of servant's pork. The fat\npigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple;\nbut the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and respect those\nwho do what is lawful and right. Even the fierce free-booters who\ngo raiding on other people's land, and Jove gives them their spoil-\neven they, when they have filled their ships and got home again live\nconscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but some god\nseems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they\nwill not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers\nof marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force, without\nfear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice\nnot one victim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for\nhe was exceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on\nthe mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men put\ntogether. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of cattle\nupon the mainland, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also twelve\ndroves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers feed him twelve\nwidely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even large\nflocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in the\ncharge of excellent goatherds. Each one of these sends the suitors\nthe best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge\nof the pigs that you see here, and I have to keep picking out the\nbest I have and sending it to them.\" \n\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously\nwithout a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and\nwas satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,\nfilled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and\nsaid as he took it in his hands, \"My friend, who was this master of\nyours that bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as\nyou tell me? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell\nme who he was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and\nthe other gods know, but I may be able to give you news of him, for\nI have travelled much.\" \n\nEumaeus answered, \"Old man, no traveller who comes here with news\nwill get Ulysses' wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless,\ntramps in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of\nlies, and not a word of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca\ngoes to my mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them\nin, makes much of them, and asks them all manner of questions, crying\nall the time as women will when they have lost their husbands. And\nyou too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up\na very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since\ntorn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and\nhis bones are lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he\nis dead and gone, and a bad business it is for all his friends- for\nme especially; go where I may I shall never find so good a master,\nnot even if I were to go home to my mother and father where I was\nbred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my parents now,\nthough I should dearly like to see them again in my own country; it\nis the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak of him\nwithout reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very fond\nof me, and took such care of me that whereever he may be I shall always\nhonour his memory.\" \n\n\"My friend,\" replied Ulysses, \"you are very positive, and very hard\nof belief about your master's coming home again, nevertheless I will\nnot merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me\nanything for my news till he has actually come, you may then give\nme a shirt and cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want,\nbut I will not take anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even\nas I hate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I\nswear by king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth\nof Ulysses to which I have now come, that all will surely happen as\nI have said it will. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with\nthe end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here\nto do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his wife and son.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Old man, you will neither\nget paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home;\ndrink you wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do\nnot keep on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any\none speaks about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let\nit alone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father\nLaertes, and his son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about this\nsame boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade fare\nto be no worse man, face and figure, than his father, but some one,\neither god or man, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone off\nto Pylos to try and get news of his father, and the suitors are lying\nin wait for him as he is coming home, in the hope of leaving the house\nof Arceisius without a name in Ithaca. But let us say no more about\nhim, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the son of Saturn\nholds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man, tell me\nyour own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you are and\nwhere you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner\nof ship you came in, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from what\ncountry they professed to come- for you cannot have come by land.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I will tell you all about it. If there were\nmeat and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing\nto do but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could\neasily talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the\nstory of the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.\n\n\"I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well-to-do man, who had many\nsons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had\npurchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax\n(whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour among\nthe Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons)\nput me on the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock.\nWhen, however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided\nhis estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding\nand little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry into\na rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the\nfield of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw\nyou can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to\nspare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked\nmy men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death\nso much as a thought, but was the first to leap forward and spear\nall whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care\nabout farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring\nup children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows-\nthings that most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing\nand another another, and this was what I was most naturally inclined\nto. Before the Achaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command\nof men and ships on foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I\nhad my pick of the spoil in the first instance, and much more was\nallotted to me later on. \n\n\"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but\nwhen Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished,\nthe people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy,\nand there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing so.\nThere we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked the\ncity of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it\nwas that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily\nwith my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea\nof making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned\nit. I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six\ndays I and my men made feast, and I found them many victims both for\nsacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh day we\nwent on board and set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind\nus though we were going down a river. Nothing went ill with any of\nour ships, and we had no sickness on board, but sat where we were\nand let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth\nday we reached the river Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the\nriver, bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them while\nI sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.\n\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives\nand children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and\nwhen they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till\nthe plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the\ngleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would\nno longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The\nEgyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced\nlabour for them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus- and\nI wish I had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much\nsorrow in store for me- I took off my helmet and shield and dropped\nmy spear from my hand; then I went straight up to the king's chariot,\nclasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade\nme get into his chariot, and took me weeping to his own home. Many\nmade at me with their ashen spears and tried to kil me in their fury,\nbut the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the protector\nof strangers, who punishes those who do evil. \n\n\"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among\nthe Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now\ngoing on for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning\nrascal, who had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this\nman talked me over into going with him to Phoenicia, where his house\nand his possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months,\nbut at the end of that time when months and days had gone by till\nthe same season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound\nfor Libya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him\nto that place, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take\nthe money I fetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board\nwith him, for I could not help it. \n\n\"The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea\nthat lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled\ntheir destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and\ncould see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our\nship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his\nthunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled with\nfire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all into\nthe sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking\nlike so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all\nchance of getting home again. I was all dismayed; Jove, however, sent\nthe ship's mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung\nto it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift\nbut in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to\nthe Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained\nme hospitably without charging me anything at all for his son found\nme when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised\nme by the hand, took me to his father's house and gave me clothes\nto wear. \n\n\"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he\nhad entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on\nhis homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and\nwrought iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep\nhis family for ten generations, so much had he left in the house of\nking Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he\nmight learn Jove's mind from the god's high oak tree, and know whether\nafter so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in\nsecret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings\nin his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side,\nand the crew found, that should take him to his own country. He sent\nme off however before Ulysses returned, for there happened to be a\nThesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium,\nand he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me safely to\nKing Acastus. \n\n\"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to\nthe very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out\nfrom land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me\nof the shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the\ntattered old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall,\nthey reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with\na strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper\nby the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having\ndrawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where\nI struck out and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore\nnear a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at\nmy having escaped and went searching about for me, till at last they\nthought it was no further use and went back to their ship. The gods,\nhaving hidden me thus easily, then took me to a good man's door- for\nit seems that I am not to die yet awhile.\" \n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Poor unhappy stranger,\nI have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting,\nbut that part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me\nto believe it. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in\nthis way? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and\nall of them detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy,\nor let him die with friends around him when the days of his fighting\nwere done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\nashes and his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the\nstorm winds have spirited him away we know not whither. \n\n\"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go\nto the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some\nnews about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both\nthose who grieve over the king's absence, and those who rejoice at\nit because they can eat up his property without paying for it. For\nmy own part I have never cared about asking anyone else since the\ntime when I was taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a man and\ncome a long way till at last he reached my station, and I was very\nkind to him. He said he had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the\nCretans, refitting his ships which had been damaged in a gale. He\nsaid Ulysses would return in the following summer or autumn with his\nmen, and that he would bring back much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate\nold man, since fate has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter\nme in this way with vain hopes. It is not for any such reason that\nI shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the god\nof hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you.\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have\ngiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make\na bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your\nmaster comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send\nme to Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say\nhe will, set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder\nprecepice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling\nlies.\" \n\n\"And a pretty figure I should cut then,\" replied Eumaeus, both now\nand hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut\nand showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good\nearnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will\ncome in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.\"\n\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with\nthe pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their sties, and\na tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them.\nBut Eumaeus called to his men and said, \"Bring in the best pig you\nhave, that I may sacrifice for this stranger, and we will take toll\nof him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding\npigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour.\" \n\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a\nfine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus\ndid not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the\nfirst thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig's face and throw\nthem into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses\nmight return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of\noak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and\nstunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they\ncut it up, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint\non to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid\nupon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces\nupon the spits and roasted them till they were done; when they had\ntaken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser in a heap.\nThe swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood up to give\nevery one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he set apart\nfor Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he\ndid so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses\nsome slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour,\nand Ulysses was much pleased. \"I hope, Eumaeus,\" said he, \"that Jove\nwill be as well disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you\nare showing to an outcast like myself.\" \n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Eat, my good fellow, and\nenjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,\njust as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.\"\n\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice\nto the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put the\ncup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulius\nbrought them their bread; the swineherd had bought this man on his\nown account from among the Taphians during his master's absence, and\nhad paid for him with his own money without saying anything either\nto his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good\nthings that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat\nand drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they\nall went to bed after having made a hearty supper. \n\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon.\nIt poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West,\nwhich is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus,\nin the excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak\nand give it him, or make one of his men give him one. \"Listen to me,\"\nsaid he, \"Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I\nwill tell you something. It is the wine that makes me talk in this\nway; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will make\nhim chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had better leave\nunspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were\nstill young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy.\nMenelaus and Ulysses were the leaders, but I was in command also,\nfor the other two would have it so. When we had come up to the wall\nof the city we crouched down beneath our armour and lay there under\ncover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about the swamp.\nIt came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell small\nand fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick with rime.\nThe others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably enough\nwith their shields about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left\nmy cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had\ngone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds\nthrough and the stars had shifted their their places, I nudged Ulysses\nwho was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me his ear.\n\n\"'Ulysses,' said I, 'this cold will be the death of me, for I have\nno cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but\nmy shirt, and I do not know what to do.' \n\n\"Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following\nplan: \n\n\"'Keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hear you.'\nThen he raised his head on his elbow. \n\n\"'My friends,' said he, 'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep.\nWe are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and\ntell Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.' \n\n\"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running\nto the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough\ntill morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in\nthose days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak\nboth out of good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier;\nbut now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby.\"\n\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Old man, you have told us an excellent story,\nand have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the\npresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else\nthat a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning\nyou have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for we\nhave not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only\none. When Ulysses' son comes home again he will give you both cloak\nand shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.\" \n\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some goatskins\nand sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here Ulysses lay\ndown, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he\nkept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.\n\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the\nswineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready\nto go and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his property\nduring his master's absence. First he slung his sword over his brawny\nshoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also took\nthe skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack\nfrom men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the pigs\nwere camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from\nthe North wind. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XV\n\nBut Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses'\nson that he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping\nin the forecourt of Menelaus's house; Pisistratus was fast asleep,\nbut Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy\nfather, so Minerva went close up to him and said: \n\n\"Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer,\nnor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house;\nthey will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have\nbeen on a fool's errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if\nyou wish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back.\nHer father and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus,\nwho has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatly\nincreasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have\nbeen taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women\nare- they always want to do the best they can for the man who marries\nthem, and never give another thought to the children of their first\nhusband, nor to their father either when he is dead and done with.\nGo home, therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable\nwoman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to send\nyou a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of another matter which\nyou had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors are lying\nin wait for you in the Strait between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean\nto kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will\nsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up\nyour property will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and\nkeep your ship well away from the islands; the god who watches over\nyou and protects you will send you a fair wind. As soon as you get\nto Ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself go straight\nto the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is well disposed towards\nyou, stay with him, therefore, for the night, and then send him to\nPenelope to tell her that you have got back safe from Pylos.\"\n\nThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus\nwith his heel to rouse him, and said, \"Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke\nthe horses to the chariot, for we must set off home.\" \n\nBut Pisistratus said, \"No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive\nin the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought\nhis presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good-bye\nto us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never forget\na host who has shown him kindness.\" \n\nAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,\nleaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he\nput on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his\nshoulders, and went out to meet him. \"Menelaus,\" said he, \"let me\ngo back now to my own country, for I want to get home.\" \n\nAnd Menelaus answered, \"Telemachus, if you insist on going I will\nnot detain you. not like to see a host either too fond of his guest\nor too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting\na man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if\nhe would like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he\nis in the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then,\ntill I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till\nyou have yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient\ndinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once\nmore proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting\nout on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making\na tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and\nwill conduct you myself through all our principal cities. No one will\nsend us away empty handed; every one will give us something- a bronze\ntripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.\" \n\n\"Menelaus,\" replied Telemachus, \"I want to go home at once, for when\nI came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while\nlooking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something\nvaluable has been stolen during my absence.\" \n\nWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants\nto prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house.\nAt this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had\njust got up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some\nmeat, which he at once did. Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant\nstore room, not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When\nhe reached the place where the treasures of his house were kept, he\nselected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also\na silver mixing-bowl. Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she\nkept the lovely dresses which she had made with her own hands, and\ntook out one that was largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery;\nit glittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest.\nThen they all came back through the house again till they got to Telemachus,\nand Menelaus said, \"Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno,\nbring you safely home according to your desire. I will now present\nyou with the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house.\nIt is a mixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid\nwith gold, and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians\nmade me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while\nI was on my return home. I should like to give it to you.\"\n\nWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,\nwhile Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and set it before\nhim. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.\n\n\"I too, my son,\" said she, \"have something for you as a keepsake from\nthe hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.\nTill then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go\nback rejoicing to your own country and to your home.\" \n\nSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly.\nThen Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them\nall as he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus\ninto the house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant\nbrought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into\na silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean\ntable beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered\nthem many good things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved\nthe meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured\nout the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things that\nwere before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to eat and\ndrink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their\nplaces in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and\nunder the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came\nafter them with a golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they\nmight make a drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front\nof the horses and pledged them, saying, \"Farewell to both of you;\nsee that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind\nto me as any father could be while we Achaeans were fighting before\nTroy.\" \n\n\"We will be sure, sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"to tell him everything\nas soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses\nreturned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very\ngreat kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents\nI am taking with me.\" \n\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand- an eagle with\na great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the\nfarm yard- and all the men and women were running after it and shouting.\nIt came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands\nin front of the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their\nhearts took comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, \"Tell me,\nMenelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for you?\" \n\nMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him\nto make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, \"I will read this\nmatter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it\nwill come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred\nand has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled\nfar and suffered much, will return to take his revenge- if indeed\nhe is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors.\"\n\n\"May Jove so grant it,\" replied Telemachus; \"if it should prove to\nbe so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when\nI am at home.\" \n\nAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed\nthrough the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon\ntheir necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and\ndarkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles\nlived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they passed\nthe night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning,\nrosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their\nplaces in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and\nunder the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed\nhis horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came\nto Pylos, and then Telemachus said: \n\n\"Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask\nyou. You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we\nare both of an age, and this journey has brought us together still\nmore closely; do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me\nthere, for if I go to your father's house he will try to keep me in\nthe warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go home at once.\"\n\nPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end\nhe deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus's\nbeautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel.\nThen he said, \"Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also\nbefore I can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he\nis, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to\nfetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he will be very\nangry.\" \n\nWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians\nand soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together\nand gave his orders. \"Now, my men,\" said he, \"get everything in order\non board the ship, and let us set out home.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But\nas Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva\nin the ship's stern, there came to him a man from a distant country,\na seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He\nwas descended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of\nsheep; he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into\nexile by the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods\nand held them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner\nin the house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on\naccount of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a\ngreat sorrow that dread Erinyes had laid upon him. In the end, however,\nhe escaped with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos,\navenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of\nNeleus to his brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos,\nwhere it was ordained that he should reign over much people. There\nhe married, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates\nand Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus,\nwho was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live\nto old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman's gifts.\nHis sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of\nMelampus, was father to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in\ngold, carried off Cleitus for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell\namong the immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer\nin the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with\nhis father and went to live in Hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied\nfor all men. \n\nHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he\nwas making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. \"Friend'\" said\nhe, \"now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you\nby your sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them,\nI pray you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell\nme the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell\nme also of your town and parents.\" \n\nTelemachus said, \"I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca,\nand my father is 'Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he\nhas come to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and\ngot my crew together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he\nhas been away a long time.\" \n\n\"I too,\" answered Theoclymenus, am an exile, for I have killed a man\nof my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they\nhave great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at\ntheir hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the\nearth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship\nthat they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit.\"\n\n\"I will not refuse you,\" replied Telemachus, \"if you wish to join\nus. Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according\nto what we have.\" \n\nOn this he received Theoclymenus' spear and laid it down on the deck\nof the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus\nsit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them\nto catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They\nset the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made\nit fast with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with\nsheets of twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew\nfresh and strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible.\nThus then they passed by Crouni and Chalcis. \n\nPresently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel\nmade a quick pass sage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the Epeans\nrule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands, wondering\nwithin himself whether he should escape death or should be taken prisoner.\n\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the\nhut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat\nand drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether\nhe would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the\nstation or pack him off to the city; so he said: \n\n\"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging\nabout the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men.\nGive me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go\nwith me and show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging\nas I needs must, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece\nof bread. I should like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring\nnews of her husband to queen Penelope. I could then go about among\nthe suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give me\na dinner. I should soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts\nof ways. Listen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing of\nMercury who gives grace and good name to the works of all men, there\nis no one living who would make a more handy servant than I should-\nto put fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine,\nand do all those services that poor men have to do for their betters.\"\n\nThe swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. \"Heaven\nhelp me,\" he exclaimed, \"what ever can have put such a notion as that\ninto your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a\ncertainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They\nwould never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their servants\nare all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and shirts, with\nwell looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept\nquite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay where\nyou are, then; you are not in anybody's way; I do not mind your being\nhere, no more do any of the others, and when Telemachus comes home\nhe will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you\nwant to go.\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are\nto me, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble;\nthere is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp; still,\nwhen men have once got low down in the world they will go through\na great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since however you\npress me to stay here and await the return of Telemachus, tell about\nUlysses' mother, and his father whom he left on the threshold of old\nage when he set out for Troy. Are they still living or are they already\ndead and in the house of Hades?\" \n\n\"I will tell you all about them,\" replied Eumaeus, \"Laertes is still\nliving and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully his own house,\nfor he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also\nabout the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him\nmore than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end through sorrow\nfor her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me\ncome to such an end as she did. As long as she was still living, though\nshe was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking her\nhow she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene,\nthe youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and she\nmade little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up,\nthey sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As\nfor me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of\nsandals for my feet, and sent me off into the country, but she was\njust as fond of me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased\nheaven to prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have\nenough to eat and drink, and can find something for any respectable\nstranger who comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or deed\nout of my mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked\npeople. Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk\nwith her; they like to have something to eat and drink at the house,\nand something too to take back with them into the country. This is\nwhat will keep servants in a good humour.\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"Then you must have been a very little fellow, Eumaeus,\nwhen you were taken so far away from your home and parents. Tell me,\nand tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother lived\nsacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you were\nalone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for\nwhatever your master gave them?\" \n\n\"Stranger,\" replied Eumaeus, \"as regards your question: sit still,\nmake yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The\nnights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for\nsleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed\ntill bed time, too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one\nof the others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can\nthen take my master's pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning.\nWe two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one\nanother stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered\nmuch, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling\nthe memory of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question,\nthen, my tale is as follows: \n\n\"You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above\nOrtygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in another direction.\nIt is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good, with much pasture\nfit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat. Dearth\nnever comes there, nor are the people plagued by any sickness, but\nwhen they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them with his\npainless shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole country\nis divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a\nman comparable to the gods, reigned over both. \n\n\"Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia\n(for the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had\nfreighted with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician\nwoman in my father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellent\nservant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing\nnear their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman\ncan resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had\nseduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on\nthis she told him her father's name. 'I come from Sidon,' said she,\n'and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I\nwas coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates seized\nme and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man who\nowns this house, and he gave them their price for me.' \n\n\"The man who had seduced her then said, 'Would you like to come along\nwith us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?\nThey are both alive and are said to be well off.' \n\n\"'I will do so gladly,' answered she, 'if you men will first swear\nme a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.'\n\n\"They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their\noath the woman said, 'Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the\nstreet or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one\nshould go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something.\nHe would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep\nyour own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can,\nand send me word when you have done loading. I will bring as much\ngold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else also that\nI can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good\nman of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about. I\nwill carry him off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of\nmoney for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.'\n\n\"On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole\nyear till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,\nand then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the\nwoman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father's\nhouse bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it;\nand while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring\nit and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and\nthen went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led\nme out of the house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables\nset with the cups of guests who had been feasting with my father,\nas being in attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting\nof the public assembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried\nthem off in the bosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew\nno better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over all the land,\nso we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,\nwhere the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they\nsailed their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent\nthen a fair wind; six days did we sail both night and day, but on\nthe seventh day Diana struck the woman and she fell heavily down into\nthe ship's hold as though she were a sea gull alighting on the water;\nso they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes, and I was left\nall sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds and waves took the ship\nto Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and thus\nit was that ever I came to set eyes upon this country.\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes\nwith the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good\nas well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master,\nwho sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead\na good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city\nto city.\" \n\nThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left\nfor sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the meantime Telemachus and\nhis crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the\nmast, and rowed the ship into the harbour. They cast out their mooring\nstones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,\nmixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough\nto eat and drink Telemachus said, \"Take the ship on to the town, but\nleave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my\nfarms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down\nto the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will\ngive you all a good dinner with meat and wine.\" \n\nThen Theoclymenus said, 'And what, my dear young friend, is to become\nof me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair? or\nshall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?\"\n\n\"At any other time,\" replied Telemachus, \"I should have bidden you\ngo to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at\nthe present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for\nI shall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often\nshow herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in\nan upper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose\nhouse you can go to- I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is\nheld in the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much\nthe best man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying\ncourt to my mother and trying to take Ulysses' place. Jove, however,\nin heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end before\nthe marriage takes place.\" \n\nAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand- a hawk, Apollo's\nmessenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore\nthem off, fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship.\nOn this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.\n\"Telemachus,\" said he, \"that bird did not fly on your right hand without\nhaving been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it\nwas an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there\nwill be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.\" \n\n\"I wish it may prove so,\" answered Telemachus. \"If it does, I will\nshow you so much good will and give you so many presents that all\nwho meet you will congratulate you.\" \n\nThen he said to his friend Piraeus, \"Piraeus, son of Clytius, you\nhave throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all\nthose who have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this\nstranger to your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can\ncome for him.\" \n\nAnd Piraeus answered, \"Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you\nplease, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack\nof hospitality.\" \n\nAs he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose\nthe hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus\nbound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head\nof sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the\nhawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city\nas they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as\nhe could, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds\nof swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who\nwas so devoted a servant to his master. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XVI\n\nMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and\nwere were getting breakfast ready at daybreak for they had sent the\nmen out with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark,\nbut fawned upon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing\nthat the dogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus: \n\n\"Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one\nof your acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning urn\nhim and not barking.\" \n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the\ndoor. Eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing\nwine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed\nhis head and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could\nnot be more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his\nold age, after ten years' absence in a foreign country and after having\ngone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as\nthough he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:\n\n\"So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When\nI heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see\nyou any more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have\na good look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you\ncome into the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to\nthe town generally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on\nwhat the suitors are doing.\" \n\n\"So be it, old friend,\" answered Telemachus, \"but I am come now because\nI want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still at her\nold home or whether some one else has married her, so that the bed\nof Ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.\"\n\n\"She is still at the house,\" replied Eumaeus, \"grieving and breaking\nher heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually.\"\n\nAs spoke he took Telemachus' spear, whereon he crossed the stone threshold\nand came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place as he\nentered, but Telemachus checked him; \"Sit down, stranger.\" said he,\n\"I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who will lay\nit for me.\" \n\nUlysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green\nbrushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemachus\nto sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat,\nthe remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he filled\nthe bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine also\nin bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they\nlaid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as\nsoon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,\n\"Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew\nbring him to Ithaca, and who were they?-for assuredly he did not come\nhere by land\"' \n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"My son, I will tell you\nthe real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great\ntraveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,\nand has refuge at my station, so I will put him into your hands. Do\nwhatever you like with him, only remember that he is your suppliant.\"\n\n\"I am very much distressed,\" said Telemachus, \"by what you have just\ntold me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young,\nand am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My\nmother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look\nafter the house out of respect for public opinion and the memory of\nher husband, or whether the time is now come for her to take the best\nman of those who are wooing her, and the one who will make her the\nmost advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to your station\nI will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals,\nand will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can\nkeep him here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food\nthat he may be no burden on you and on your men; but I will not have\nhim go near the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure\nto ill-treat him in a way that would greatly grieve me; no matter\nhow valiant a man may be he can do nothing against numbers, for they\nwill be too strong for him.\" \n\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, it is right that I should say something myself.\nI am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way\nin which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you\nare. Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some\ngod set your people against you? May you not complain of your brothers-\nfor it is to these that a man may look for support, however great\nhis quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my present\nmind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would\nrather some one came and cut my head off, but I would go to the house\nand be the bane of every one of these men. If they were too many for\nme- I being single-handed- I would rather die fighting in my own house\nthan see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly\nmaltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in\nan unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no\npurpose for an end that shall never be accomplished.\" \n\nAnd Telemachus answered, \"I will tell you truly everything. There\nis no emnity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers,\nto whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be.\nJove has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of\nArceisius, and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son\nof Ulysses who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have\nnever been of any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the\nhands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring\nislands, Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all the principal men\nof Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying\ncourt to my mother, who will neither say point blank that she will\nnot marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, so they are making havoc\nof my estate, and before long will do so with myself into the bargain.\nThe issue, however, rests with heaven. But do you, old friend Eumaeus,\ngo at once and tell Penelope that I am safe and have returned from\nPylos. Tell it to herself alone, and then come back here without letting\nany one else know, for there are many who are plotting mischief against\nme.\" \n\n\"I understand and heed you,\" replied Eumaeus; \"you need instruct me\nno further, only I am going that way say whether I had not better\nlet poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend\nthe work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses,\nand he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they\ntell me that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither\neaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after his farm,\nbut sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.\"\n\n\"More's the pity,\" answered Telemachus, \"I am sorry for him, but we\nmust leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything\ntheir own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return\nof my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back\nagain, and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother\nto send one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him\nhear it from her.\" \n\nThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,\nbound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched\nhim well off the station, and then came up to it in the form of a\nwoman- fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the\nentry, and revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see\nher, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let themselves\nbe seen by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs, for they\ndid not bark, but went scared and whining off to the other side of\nthe yards. She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows;\nwhereon he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall\nof the yards. Then she said to him: \n\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell your\nson: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for\nthe destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will\nnot be long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.\"\n\nAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw\na fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him\nyounger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,\nfilled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she\nwent away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded\nwhen he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking\nupon a god. \n\n\"Stranger,\" said he, \"how suddenly you have changed from what you\nwere a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour\nis not the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in\nheaven? If so, be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice\nand offerings of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.\" \n\nAnd Ulysses said, \"I am no god, why should you take me for one? I\nam your father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at\nthe hands of lawless men.\" \n\nAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on to\nthe ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. but Telemachus\ncould not yet believe that it was his father, and said: \n\n\"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes\nthat I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself\ncontrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young\nat a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. A second ago you\nwere old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down\nfrom heaven.\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably\nastonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who\nwill come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering\nand much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.\nWhat you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva,\nwho does with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases.\nAt one moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young\nman with good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods\nwho live in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.\"\n\nAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father\nand wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like\neagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their\nhalf fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and\nthe sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had\nnot suddenly said, \"In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring\nyou to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be- for\nyou cannot have come by land?\" \n\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" replied Ulysses. \"It was the\nPhaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in\nthe habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They\ntook me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca,\nafter giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These\nthings by heaven's mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now\ncome here on the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing\nour enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with\ntheir number, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can\nthen turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether we two can fight\nthe whole body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to\nhelp us.\" \n\nTo this Telemachus answered, \"Father, I have always heard of your\nrenown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of\nis a very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men\ncannot stand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors\nonly, nor twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their\nnumber at once. There are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium,\nand they have six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty\nyoung Achaeans from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all\nof them well born. They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and\ntwo men who can carve at table. If we face such numbers as this, you\nmay have bitter cause to rue your coming, and your revenge. See whether\nyou cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and help\nus.\" \n\n\"Listen to me,\" replied Ulysses, \"and think whether Minerva and her\nfather Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find some\none else as well.\" \n\n\"Those whom you have named,\" answered Telemachus, \"are a couple of\ngood allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have\npower over both gods and men.\" \n\n\"These two,\" continued Ulysses, \"will not keep long out of the fray,\nwhen the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return\nhome early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as before.\nLater on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable\nold beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel your heart against\nmy sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of the house,\nor throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently trying\nto make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to you,\nfor the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and\nlay my saying to your heart, when Minerva shall put it in my mind,\nI will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect\nall the armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store\nroom. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing\nit; say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke,\ninasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but\nhas become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly\nthat you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine,\nand that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both\nbanquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people\nto use them. But leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and\nme, and a couple oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any\nmoment; Jove and Minerva will then soon quiet these people. There\nis also another matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs\nin your veins, let no one know that Ulysses is within the house- neither\nLaertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even\nPenelope herself. Let you and me exploit the women alone, and let\nus also make trial of some other of the men servants, to see who is\non our side and whose hand is against us.\" \n\n\"Father,\" replied Telemachus, \"you will come to know me by and by,\nand when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not\nthink, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either\nof us. Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round\nof the farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will\nbe wasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove\nthe women by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless,\nbut I am not in favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend\nto that later on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will\nsupport you.\" \n\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought Telemachus\nand his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When they\nhad come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land; their\nservants came and took their armour from them, and they left all the\npresents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell\nPenelope that Telemachus had gone into the country, but had sent the\nship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.\nThis servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the\nsame errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House,\nthe servant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the\nwaiting women, \"Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos\"; but\nEumaeus went close up to Penelope, and said privately that her son\nhad given bidden him tell her. When he had given his message he left\nthe house with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs again.\n\nThe suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they\nwent outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held\na council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was\nthe first to speak. \n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"this voyage of Telemachus's is a very serious\nmatter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now, however,\nlet us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to send\nafter the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.\"\n\nHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and\nsaw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails,\nand putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others,\n\"We need not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must\nhave told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not overtake\nher. \n\nOn this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the\nship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they\nwent up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let\nany one old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes,\nspoke first. \n\n\"Good heavens,\" said he, \"see how the gods have saved this man from\ndestruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all\nday long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep,\nbut waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing\nand killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us.\nLet us consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape\nus; our affair is never likely to come off while is alive, for he\nis very shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our side.\nWe must make haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he\nwill lose no time in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and\nwill tell all the world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to\ntake him. The people will not like this when they come to know of\nit; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from our own\ncountry into exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either on his farm\naway from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can divide up his\nproperty amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marries her\nhave the house. If this does not please you, and you wish Telemachus\nto live on and hold his father's property, then we must not gather\nhere and eat up his goods in this way, but must make our offers to\nPenelope each from his own house, and she can marry the man who will\ngive the most for her, and whose lot it is to win her.\" \n\nThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the\nson of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among\nall the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of\nDulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope\nthan that of any of the other for he was a man of good natural disposition.\n\"My friends,\" said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly,\n\"I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous thing to\nkill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods,\nand if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to kill him\nmyself, and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade\nus, I would have you hold your hands.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose forthwith\nand went to the house of Ulysses where they took their accustomed\nseats. \n\nThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors.\nShe knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had\noverheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore\nto the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors\nshe stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister\nholding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:\n\n\"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best\nspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you\nare nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the\ndeath of Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness\nis Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one\nanother. Do you not remember how your father fled to this house in\nfear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gone with\nsome Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace\nwith us? They wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he\nhad, but Ulysses stayed their hands although they were infuriated,\nand now you devour his property without paying for it, and break my\nheart by his wooing his wife and trying to kill his son. Leave off\ndoing so, and stop the others also.\" \n\nTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, \"Take heart, Queen Penelope\ndaughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about these matters.\nThe man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall lay hands upon\nyour son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon the face of the\nearth. I say- and it shall surely be- that my spear shall be reddened\nwith his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees,\nheld wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands.\nTherefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing\nto fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to\nhim from the gods, he cannot escape it.\" He said this to quiet her,\nbut in reality he was plotting against Telemachus. \n\nThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva\nshed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses\nand his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and\nwere ready; helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore\ncame up to Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke of her\nwand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd\nmight recognize him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.\n\nTelemachus was the first to speak. \"So you have got back, Eumaeus,\"\nsaid he. \"What is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned,\nor are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?\"\n\n\"I did not think of asking about that,\" replied Eumaeus, \"when I was\nin the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon\nas I could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos,\nand he was the first to tell the new your mother, but I can say what\nI saw with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill\nof Mercury above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with\na number of men in her. They had many shields and spears, and I thought\nit was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.\" \n\nOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus\ncould not see him. \n\nThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they\nate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied.\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to\nrest and enjoyed the boon of sleep. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XVII\n\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus\nbound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands,\nfor he wanted to go into the city. \"Old friend,\" said he to the swineherd,\n\"I will now go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will\nnever leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate\nstranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who\nwill give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough\nof my own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes\nhim angry so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean.\"\n\nThen Ulysses said, \"Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can\nalways do better in town than country, for any one who likes can give\nhim something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck\nand call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told\nhim, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire,\nand the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly\nthin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you\nsay the city is some way off.\" \n\nOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge\nupon the When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing-post\nof the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and\nwent inside. \n\nNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting\nthe fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up\nto him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and\nshoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking\nlike Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son.\nShe kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, \"Light of my\neyes,\" she cried as she spoke fondly to him, \"so you are come home\nagain; I made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think\nof your having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it\nor obtaining my consent. But come, tell me what you saw.\"\n\n\"Do not scold me, mother,' answered Telemachus, \"nor vex me, seeing\nwhat a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress,\ngo upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs\nto all the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors.\nI must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has\ncome back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and told\nPiraeus to take him home and look after him till I could come for\nhim myself.\" \n\nShe heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress, and\nvowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would\nonly vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors. \n\nTelemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand-\nnot alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him\nwith a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him\nas he went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words\nin their mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and\nwent to sit with Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of\nhis father's house, and they made him tell them all that had happened\nto him. Then Piraeus came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted\nthrough the town to the place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once\njoined them. Piraeus was first to speak: \"Telemachus,\" said he, \"I\nwish you would send some of your women to my house to take awa the\npresents Menelaus gave you.\" \n\n\"We do not know, Piraeus,\" answered Telemachus, \"what may happen.\nIf the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among\nthem, I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people\nshould get hold of them. If on the other hand I manage to kill them,\nI shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.\"\n\nWith these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they\ngot there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into\nthe baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed\nthem, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats\nat table. A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden\newer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands;\nand she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them\nbread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.\nOpposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the bearing-posts\nof the cloister, and spinning. Then they laid their hands on the good\nthings that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to\neat and drink Penelope said: \n\n\"Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which\nI have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set\nout for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make\nit clear to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether\nor no you had been able to hear anything about the return of your\nfather.\" \n\n\"I will tell you then truth,\" replied her son. \"We went to Pylos and\nsaw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably\nas though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long\nabsence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word\nfrom any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead.\nHe sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There\nI saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were\nin heaven's wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was\nthat had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth,\nwhereon he said, 'So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man's\nbed? A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a\nlion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell.\nThe lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with\nthe pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father\nJove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was\nwhen he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily\nthat all the Greeks cheered him- if he is still such, and were to\ncome near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry\nwedding. As regards your question, however, I will not prevaricate\nnor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much\nwill I tell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on an island\nsorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was keeping\nhim prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no ships\nnor sailors to take him over the sea.' This was what Menelaus told\nme, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave\nme a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.\" \n\nWith these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus\nsaid to her: \n\n\"Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these things;\nlisten therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide\nnothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness, and the\nrites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come,\nthat Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about\nthe country or staying in one place, is enquiring into all these evil\ndeeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen\nwhen I was on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about\nit.\" \n\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true,\nyou shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who\nsee you shall congratulate you.\" \n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs,\nor aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of\nthe house, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it\nwas now time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come\ninto the town from all the country round, with their shepherds as\nusual, then Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited\nupon them at table, said, \"Now then, my young masters, you have had\nenough sport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner\nis not a bad thing, at dinner time.\" \n\nThey left their sports as he told them, and when they were within\nthe house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside,\nand then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of\nthem fat and well grown. Thus they made ready for their meal. In the\nmeantime Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town,\nand the swineherd said, \"Stranger, I suppose you still want to go\nto town to-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part\nI should have liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must\ndo as my master tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding\nfrom one's master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for\nit is now broad day; it will be night again directly and then you\nwill find it colder.\" \n\n\"I know, and understand you,\" replied Ulysses; \"you need say no more.\nLet us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it\nto walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.\"\n\nAs he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,\nby the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his\nliking. The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the\ndogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and\nhis master followed after, looking like some broken-down old tramp\nas he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When\nthey had got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city,\nthey reached the fountain from which the citizens drew their water.\nThis had been made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a\ngrove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and\nthe clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, while above\nthe fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers\nused to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as\nhe was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors'\ndinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus\nand Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language,\nwhich made Ulysses very angry. \n\n\"There you go,\" cried he, \"and a precious pair you are. See how heaven\nbrings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray, master\nswineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make\nany one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never\nwon a prize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his\nshoulders against every man's door post, and begging, not for swords\nand cauldrons like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth begging\nfor. If you would give him to me for a hand on my station, he might\ndo to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids,\nand he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but\nhe has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he\nwill do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, to feed his insatiable\nbelly. I say, therefore and it shall surely be- if he goes near Ulysses'\nhouse he will get his head broken by the stools they will fling at\nhim, till they turn him out.\" \n\nOn this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure\nwantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path.\nFor a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill\nhim with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains\nout; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check,\nbut the swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting\nup his hands and praying to heaven as he did so. \n\n\"Fountain nymphs,\" he cried, \"children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned\nyou thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my\nprayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to\nthe swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting\npeople-gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin\nthrough bad shepherding.\" \n\nThen Melanthius the goatherd answered, \"You ill-conditioned cur, what\nare you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship\nand take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket\nthe money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would\nstrike Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill\nhim, as I am that Ulysses will never come home again.\" \n\nWith this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went\nquickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he\ngot there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite\nEurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. The servants\nbrought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread\nbefore him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd\ncame up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius\nwas just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold\nof the swineherd's hand, and said: \n\n\"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how\nfar you go you will find few like it. One building keeps following\non after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all\nround it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it\nwould be a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too,\nthat there are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell\nof roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods have made\nto go along with feasting.\" \n\nThen Eumaeus said, \"You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally\ndo; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside\nfirst and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you\nwait here and let me go in first? But do not wait long, or some one\nmay you loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider\nthis matter I pray you.\" \n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I understand and heed. Go in first and leave\nme here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things\nthrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea\nthat I am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a\nman cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy\nwhich gives much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships\nare fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other people.\"\n\nAs they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised\nhis head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had\nbred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out\nof him. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when\nthey went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his\nmaster was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow\ndung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come\nand draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas.\nAs soon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and\nwagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When\nUlysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from\nhis eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and said: \n\n\"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:\nhis build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he\nonly one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept\nmerely for show?\" \n\n\"This hound,\" answered Eumaeus, \"belonged to him who has died in a\nfar country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he\nwould soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in\nthe forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks.\nBut now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone,\nand the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when\ntheir master's hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes half the\ngoodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.\" \n\nAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the\nsuitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.\n\nTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned\nhim to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat\nlying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the\nsuitors; he picked it up, brought it to Telemachus's table, and sat\ndown opposite him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave\nhim bread from the bread-basket. \n\nImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor miserable\nold beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags.\nHe sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading\nfrom the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood\nwhich the carpenter had skillfully planed, and had made to join truly\nwith rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the bread-basket,\nwith as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and said to Eumaeus,\n\"Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of the suitors,\nand beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced.\" \n\nSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, \"Stranger, Telemachus sends you\nthis, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for\nbeggars must not be shamefaced.\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus,\nand fulfil the desire of his heart.\" \n\nThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid\nit on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while\nthe bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left\noff. The suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses\nand prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors,\nthat he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good\nfrom the bad; but come what might she was not going to save a single\none of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left\nto right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real\nbeggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking\none another who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd\nMelanthius said, \"Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something\nabout him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd brought him here,\nbut I know nothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from.\"\n\nOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. \"You precious idiot,\"\nhe cried, \"what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not\ntramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?\nDo you think it a small thing that such people gather here to waste\nyour master's property and must you needs bring this man as well?\"\n\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Antinous, your birth is good but your words\nevil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to\ninvite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those\nwho can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter,\nor a bard who can charm us with his Such men are welcome all the world\nover, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him.\nYou are always harder on Ulysses' servants than any of the other suitors\nare, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as Telemachus\nand Penelope are alive and here.\" \n\nBut Telemachus said, \"Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the bitterest\ntongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.\"\n\nThen turning to Antinous he said, \"Antinous, you take as much care\nof my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to\nsee this stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take' something\nand give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never\nmind my mother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I\nknow you will not do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things\nyourself than of giving them to other people.\" \n\n\"What do you mean, Telemachus,\" replied Antinous, \"by this swaggering\ntalk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would\nnot come here again for another three months.\" \n\nAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from\nunder the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses,\nbut the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet\nwith bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold\nand eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to Antinous\nand said: \n\n\"Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here;\nyou seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should\nbe the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty.\nI too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those\ndays I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might\nbe nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other\nthings which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy,\nbut it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band\nof roving robbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone\nby it. I stationed my bade ships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my\nmen stay by them and keep guard over them, while sent out scouts to\nreconnoitre from every point of vantage. \n\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives\nand children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and\nwhen they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till\nthe plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam\nof armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no\nlonger face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians\nkilled many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for\nthem; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them, to take\nto Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man in Cyprus.\nThence I am come hither in a state of great misery.\" \n\nThen Antinous said, \"What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague\nus during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court, or\nI will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and\nimportunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given\nyou lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to\nbe free with other people's property when there is plenty of it.\"\n\nOn this Ulysses began to move off, and said, \"Your looks, my fine\nsir, are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house\nyou would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for though\nyou are in another man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot\nfind it in you to give him even a piece of bread.\" \n\nThis made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, \"You\nshall pay for this before you get clear of the court.\" With these\nwords he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder-blade\nnear the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow\ndid not even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded\non his revenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there,\nlaying his well-filled wallet at his feet. \n\n\"Listen to me,\" he cried, \"you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may\nspeak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he\ngets hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle;\nand even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable\nbelly, which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the\npoor have gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous\nmay come to a bad end before his marriage.\" \n\n\"Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off elsewhere,\"\nshouted Antinous. \"If you say more I will have you dragged hand and\nfoot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you alive.\"\n\nThe other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young\nmen said, \"Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a\ntramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god-\nand we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people\nfrom foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who do amiss\nand who righteously.\" \n\nThus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile Telemachus\nwas furious about the blow that had been given to his father, and\nthough no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence and brooded\non his revenge. \n\nNow when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the banqueting-cloister,\nshe said before her maids, \"Would that Apollo would so strike you,\nAntinous,\" and her waiting woman Eurynome answered, \"If our prayers\nwere answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the sun\nrise.\" Then Penelope said, \"Nurse, I hate every single one of them,\nfor they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinous like the darkness\nof death itself. A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about the\nhouse for sheer want. Every one else has given him something to put\nin his wallet, but Antinous has hit him on the right shoulder-blade\nwith a footstool.\" \n\nThus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in\nthe meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the\nswineherd and said, \"Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here,\nI want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled\nmuch, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"If these Achaeans, Madam,\nwould only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his\nadventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,\nwhich was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,\nand he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had\nbeen the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose\nlips all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed\nas I sat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship\nbetween his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete\nwhere the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither\nand thither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he\nhas heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians,\nand that he is bringing great wealth home with him.\" \n\n\"Call him here, then,\" said Penelope, \"that I too may hear his story.\nAs for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as\nthey will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine\nremain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume\nthem, while they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing\nour oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving\nso much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate\ncan stand such recklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect\nus. If he were to come again, he and his son would soon have their\nrevenge.\" \n\nAs she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded\nwith it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaeus,\n\"Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just\nas I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are going\nto be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore I\nsay, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger\nis speaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear.\"\n\nWhen Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said, \"Father\nstranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for\nyou; she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can\ntell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking\nthe truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very\nthings that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough\nof that to fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting\nthose give that will.\" \n\n\"I will tell Penelope,\" answered Ulysses, \"nothing but what is strictly\ntrue. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him\nin affliction, but I am afraid of passing. through this crowd of cruel\nsuitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now, moreover,\nas I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man gave\nme a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any one\nelse defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait\ntill sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my\nclothes are worn very thin- you know they are, for you have seen them\never since I first asked you to help me- she can then ask me about\nthe return of her husband.\" \n\nThe swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she\nsaw him cross the threshold, \"Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus?\nIs he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming\ninside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.\"\n\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"The stranger is quite\nreasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any\none else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be\nmuch better, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when\nyou can hear him and talk to him as you will.\" \n\n\"The man is no fool,\" answered Penelope, \"it would very likely be\nas he says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world\nas these men are.\" \n\nWhen she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he\nhad explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in\nhis ear so that none could overhear him, \"My dear sir, I will now\ngo back to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business.\nYou will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful to\nkeep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May\nJove bring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Telemachus, \"go home when you have had your dinner,\nand in the morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice\nfor the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.\" \n\nOn this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his\ndinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table,\nand went back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began\nto amuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting\non towards evening. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XVIII\n\nNow there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all\nover the city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton\nand drunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he was\na great hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother\ngave him, was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called him Irus,\nbecause he used to run errands for any one who would send him. As\nsoon as he came he began to insult Ulysses, and to try and drive him\nout of his own house. \n\n\"Be off, old man,\" he cried, \"from the doorway, or you shall be dragged\nout neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me the\nwink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like\nto do so? Get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to blows.\"\n\nUlysses frowned on him and said, \"My friend, I do you no manner of\nharm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is\nroom enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge\nme things that are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another\ntramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by\nand by. Do not, however, talk too much about fighting or you will\nincense me, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest\nwith blood. I shall have more peace to-morrow if I do, for you will\nnot come to the house of Ulysses any more.\" \n\nIrus was very angry and answered, \"You filthy glutton, you run on\ntrippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands\nabout you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar's\ntusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and\nlook on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much younger\nthan yourself.\" \n\nThus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front\nof the doorway, and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed\nheartily and said to the others, \"This is the finest sport that you\never saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house.\nThe stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight, let us\nset them on to do so at once.\" \n\nThe suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two ragged\ntramps. \"Listen to me,\" said Antinous, \"there are some goats' paunches\ndown at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set\naside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the\nbetter man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our\ntable and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all.\"\n\nThe others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent, said,\n\"Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold\nhis own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on,\nthough I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear,\nhowever that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour Irus and\nsecure him the victory.\" \n\nThey swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath\nTelemachus put in a word and said, \"Stranger, if you have a mind to\nsettle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here. Whoever\nstrikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and the other\nchiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of understanding,\nare of the same mind as I am.\" \n\nEvery one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,\nthus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and\nhis mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even\nstronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one\nwould turn towards his neighbour saying, \"The stranger has brought\nsuch a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left\nof Irus.\" \n\nIrus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded\nhim by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court] in\nsuch a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded\nhim and said, \"You swaggering bully, you ought never to have been\nborn at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creature\nas this tramp is. I say, therefore- and it shall surely be- if he\nbeats you and proves himself the better man, I shall pack you off\non board ship to the mainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills\nevery one that comes near him. He will cut off your nose and ears,\nand draw out your entrails for the dogs to eat.\" \n\nThis frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the middle\nof the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then Ulysses\nconsidered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an\nend of him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter\nblow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best\nto give the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect\nwho he was. Then they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the\nright shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the\near that broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came gushing\nout of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth\nand kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and\nnearly died of laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by the foot\nand dragged him into the outer court as far as the gate-house. There\nhe propped him up against the wall and put his staff in his hands.\n\"Sit here,\" said he, \"and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful\ncreature, and if you try to make yourself king of the beggars any\nmore you shall fare still worse.\" \n\nThen he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, over his\nshoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down\nupon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing\nand saluting him, \"May Jove, and all the other gods,\" said they, 'grant\nyou whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of\nthis insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently,\nto king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him.\"\n\nUlysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat's\npaunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves\nout of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he\ndid so in a golden goblet of wine. \"Good luck to you,\" he said, \"father\nstranger, you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have\nbetter times by and by.\" \n\nTo this Ulysses answered, \"Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of good\nunderstanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are.\nI have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium,\na man both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you\nappear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed\nto what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have\ntheir being upon earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and\nstrength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even\nwhen the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs\nmust, and makes the best of it; for God Almighty gives men their daily\nminds day by day. I know all about it, for I was a rich man once,\nand did much wrong in the stubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence\nthat my father and my brothers would support me; therefore let a man\nfear God in all things always, and take the good that heaven may see\nfit to send him without vainglory. Consider the infamy of what these\nsuitors are doing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing\ndishonour to the wife, of one who is certain to return some day, and\nthat, too, not long hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send\nyou home quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of\nhis coming, for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly.\"\n\nWith these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he\nput the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked away\nserious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so he\ndid not escape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him fall by the\nhand of Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from which\nhe had come. \n\nThen Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the\nsuitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and\nwin still further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned\na mocking laugh and said, \"Eurynome, I have changed my and have a\nfancy to show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should\nlike also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything\nmore to do with them. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" answered Eurynome, \"all that you have said is true,\ngo and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint\nyour face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears;\nit is not right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus,\nwhom you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is\nalready grown up.\" \n\n\"I know, Eurynome,\" replied Penelope, \"that you mean well, but do\nnot try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed\nme of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell\nAutonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when\nI am in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it would\nnot be proper for me to do so.\" \n\nOn this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go to\ntheir mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another matter,\nand sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on her\ncouch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed\ngrace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her.\nShe washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears\nwhen she goes dancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of\na more commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter\nthan sawn ivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away, whereon\nthe maids came in from the women's room and woke Penelope with the\nsound of their talking. \n\n\"What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,\" said she,\nas she passed her hands over her face, \"in spite of all my misery.\nI wish Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment,\nthat I might no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband,\nwho possessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished\nman among the Achaeans.\" \n\nWith these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but\nattended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she\nstood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,\nholding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either\nside of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and\nbecame so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might\nwin her for his own bed fellow. \n\n\"Telemachus,\" said she, addressing her son, \"I fear you are no longer\nso discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger\nyou had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown\nup, though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of\na well-to-do father as far as size and good looks go, your conduct\nis by no means what it should be. What is all this disturbance that\nhas been going on, and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully\nill-treated? What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury\nwhile a suppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very discreditable\nto you.\" \n\n\"I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,\" replied\nTelemachus, \"I understand all about it and know when things are not\nas they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,\nhowever, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and\nthen another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my\nmind, and I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight\nbetween Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant\nit to do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,\nMinerva, and Apollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers\nof yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might\nall be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court.\nSee how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing\nthat he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home, wherever\nthat may be, for has no strength left in him.\" \n\nThus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, \"Queen Penelope,\ndaughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could see\nyou at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your house\nby tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole\nworld both as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding.\"\n\nTo this Penelope replied, \"Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my\nbeauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy\nand my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after\nmy affairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presence\nto the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\nwhich heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all,\nand when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand- 'Wife,\n'he said, 'we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the\nTrojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent also\nat fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight\nsooner than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send\nme back to you, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the\nmeantime do you look after things here. Take care of my father and\nmother as at present, and even more so during my absence, but when\nyou see our son growing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave\nthis your present home. This is what he said and now it is all coming\ntrue. A night will come when I shall have to yield myself to a marriage\nwhich I detest, for Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness.\nThis further grief, moreover, cuts me to the very heart. You suitors\nare not wooing me after the custom of my country. When men are courting\na woman who they think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble\nbirth, and when they are each trying to win her for himself, they\nusually bring oxen and sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and\nthey make her magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people's\nproperty without paying for it.\" \n\nThis was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying\nto get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair\nwords which he knew she did not mean. \n\nThen Antinous said, \"Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as\nmany presents as you please from any one who will give them to you;\nit is not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business\nnor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among\nus whoever he may be.\" \n\nThe others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his\nservant to bring his present. Antinous's man returned with a large\nand lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully\nmade brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus\nimmediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads\nthat gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas's two men returned with some\nearrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most\nbeautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace\nof the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful\npresent of some kind. \n\nThen the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought\nthe presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and\ndancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it\ngrew dark; they then brought in three braziers to give light, and\npiled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torches\nfrom them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses\nsaid: \n\n\"Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the\nqueen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick\nwool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till\nmorning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.\"\n\nThe maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho\nbegan to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but\nhad been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play\nwith, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all\nthis she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress,\nand used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was\nin love. \n\n\"Poor wretch,\" said she, \"are you gone clean out of your mind? Go\nand sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering\nhere. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters-\nso many of them too? Has the wine been getting into your head, or\ndo you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits\nbecause you beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than\nhe does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding\nout of the house.\" \n\n\"Vixen,\" replied Ulysses, scowling at her, \"I will go and tell Telemachus\nwhat you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb from limb.\"\n\nWith these words he scared the women, and they went off into the body\nof the house. They trembled all aver, for they thought he would do\nas he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers,\nholding up torches and looking at the people- brooding the while on\nthings that should surely come to pass. \n\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their insolence,\nfor she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against them; she\ntherefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him, which made\nthe others laugh. \"Listen to me,\" said he, \"you suitors of Queen Penelope,\nthat I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for nothing that this\nman has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe the light has not\nbeen coming from the torches, but from his own head- for his hair\nis all gone, every bit of it.\" \n\nThen turning to Ulysses he said, \"Stranger, will you work as a servant,\nif I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you\nbuild a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year\nround, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then?\nNot you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not want to work;\nyou had rather fill your belly by going round the country begging.\"\n\n\"Eurymachus,\" answered Ulysses, \"if you and I were to work one against\nthe other in early summer when the days are at their longest- give\nme a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which\nwill fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when\nthe mowing grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us\neach take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and\nendurance: turn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or\nI can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out\nthis day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting\nwell upon my temples- you would find me foremost in the fray, and\nwould cease your gibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel,\nand think yourself a great man because you live in a little world,\nind that a bad one. If Ulysses comes to his own again, the doors of\nhis house are wide, but you will find them narrow when you try to\nfly through them.\" \n\nEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, \"You\nwretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me,\nand in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do\nyou always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because\nyou beat the tramp Irus. With this he caught hold of a footstool,\nbut Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium,\nfor he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and\nknocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and his\nwine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered cloister\nwere now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his neighbour, saying,\n\"I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad luck to hide, for\nall the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such disturbance about\na beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail we shall have no more\npleasure at our banquet.\" \n\nOn this Telemachus came forward and said, \"Sirs, are you mad? Can\nyou not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit\nhas possessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you\nhave had your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.\"\n\nThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\nbut Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, \"Do\nnot let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no answer.\nNeither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of Ulysses'\nservants. Let the cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings, that\nwe may make them and go home to our rest. As for the stranger, let\nus leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to his house that\nhe has come.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of\nDulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water\nand handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they made\ntheir drink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had made\ntheir drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded, they\ntook their several ways each of them to his own abode. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XIX\n\nUlysses was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby\nwith Minerva's help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently\nhe said to Telemachus, \"Telemachus, we must get the armour together\nand take it down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you\nwhy you have removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the\nway of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses\nwent away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this\nmore particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel\nover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may\ndisgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes\ntempts people to use them.\" \n\nTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called nurse\nEuryclea and said, \"Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while\nI take the armour that my father left behind him down into the store\nroom. No one looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got\nall smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down\nwhere the smoke cannot reach it.\" \n\n\"I wish, child,\" answered Euryclea, \"that you would take the management\nof the house into your own hands altogether, and look after all the\nproperty yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the\nstore room? The maids would have so, but you would not let them.\n\n\"The stranger,\" said Telemachus, \"shall show me a light; when people\neat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.\"\n\nEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room.\nThen Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets, shields,\nand spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in\nher hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus\nsaid, \"Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the\nrafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow\nas with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come\ndown from heaven.\" \n\n\"Hush,\" answered Ulysses, \"hold your peace and ask no questions, for\nthis is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me\nhere to talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief\nwill ask me all sorts of questions.\" \n\nOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner\ncourt, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed\ntill morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering on\nthe means whereby with Minerva's help he might be able to kill the\nsuitors. \n\nThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana,\nand they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near\nthe fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and\nhad a footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was\ncovered with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came\nfrom the women's room to join her. They set about removing the tables\nat which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away the bread\nthat was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied\nthe embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to\ngive both light and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a\nsecond time and said, \"Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging\nabout the house all night and spying upon the women? Be off, you wretch,\noutside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven out with\na firebrand.\" \n\nUlysses scowled at her and answered, \"My good woman, why should you\nbe so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes\nare all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging about after\nthe manner of tramps and beggars generall? I too was a rich man once,\nand had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp\nsuch as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I\nhad any number of servants, and all the other things which people\nhave who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove\nto take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too come\nto lose that pride and place in which you now wanton above your fellows;\nhave a care lest you get out of favour with your mistress, and lest\nUlysses should come home, for there is still a chance that he may\ndo so. Moreover, though he be dead as you think he is, yet by Apollo's\nwill he has left a son behind him, Telemachus, who will note anything\ndone amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no longer in his\nboyhood.\" \n\nPenelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, \"Impudent\nbaggage, said she, \"I see how abominably you are behaving, and you\nshall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself,\nthat I was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband,\nfor whose sake I am in such continual sorrow.\" \n\nThen she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, \"Bring a seat with\na fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his\nstory, and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.\"\n\nEurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as\nsoon as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, \"Stranger,\nI shall first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town\nand parents.\" \n\n\"Madam;\" answered Ulysses, \"who on the face of the whole earth can\ndare to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven\nitself; you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness,\nas the monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its\nwheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring\nforth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues,\nand his people do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here\nin your house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know\nmy race and family, or you will recall memories that will yet more\nincrease my sorrow. I am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit\nweeping and wailing in another person's house, nor is it well to be\nthus grieving continually. I shall have one of the servants or even\nyourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tears\nbecause I am heavy with wine.\" \n\nThen Penelope answered, \"Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,\nwhether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and\nmy dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my\naffairs I should be both more respected and should show a better presence\nto the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions\nwhich heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our\nislands- Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself,\nare wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore\nshow no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who\nsay that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time brokenhearted\nabout Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to\ninvent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven\nput it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and\nto begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I\nsaid to them, 'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not\npress me to marry again immediately; wait- for I would not have my\nskill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have finished making\na pall for the hero Laertes, to be ready against the time when death\nshall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk\nif he is laid out without a pall.' This was what I said, and they\nassented; whereon I used to keep working at my great web all day long,\nbut at night I would unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled\nthem in this way for three years without their finding it out, but\nas time wore on and I was now in my fourth year, in the waning of\nmoons, and many days had been accomplished, those good-for-nothing\nhussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who broke in upon me\nand caught me; they were very angry with me, so I was forced to finish\nmy work whether I would or no. And now I do not see how I can find\nany further shift for getting out of this marriage. My parents are\nputting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at the ravages the\nsuitors are making upon his estate, for he is now old enough to understand\nall about it and is perfectly able to look after his own affairs,\nfor heaven has blessed him with an excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding\nall this, tell me who you are and where you come from- for you must\nhave had father and mother of some sort; you cannot be the son of\nan oak or of a rock.\" \n\nThen Ulysses answered, \"madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist\nin asking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs\nme: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as\nlong as I have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless,\nas regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair\nand fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled\nand there are nine cities in it: the people speak many different languages\nwhich overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans,\nDorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great town\nthere, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every nine years had a conference\nwith Jove himself. Minos was father to Deucalion, whose son I am,\nfor Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus sailed\nfor Troy, and I, who am the younger, am called Aethon; my brother,\nhowever, was at once the older and the more valiant of the two; hence\nit was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him hospitality, for\nthe winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy, carrying him\nout of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in Amnisus off the\ncave of Ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to enter and he\ncould hardly find shelter from the winds that were then xaging. As\nsoon as he got there he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus,\nclaiming to be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already\nset sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to\nmy own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had abundance\nof everything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with barley\nmeal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and oxen\nfor them to sacrifice to their heart's content. They stayed with me\ntwelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the North so strong\nthat one could hardly keep one's feet on land. I suppose some unfriendly\ngod had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the wind dropped,\nand they got away.\" \n\nMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept\nas she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon\nthe mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed\nupon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even\nso did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all\nthe time sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was for her,\nbut he kept his eyes as hard as or iron without letting them so much\nas quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she\nhad relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said:\n\"Now, stranger, I shall put you to the test and see whether or no\nyou really did entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did.\nTell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look\nat, and so also with his companions.\" \n\n\"Madam,\" answered Ulysses, \"it is such a long time ago that I can\nhardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home,\nand went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect.\nUlysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened\nby a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this\nthere was a device that showed a dog holding a spotted fawn between\nhis fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground.\nEvery one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done\nin gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the\nfawn was struggling convulsively to escape. As for the shirt that\nhe wore next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the\nskin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration\nof all the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying\nto your heart, that I do not know whether Ulysses wore these clothes\nwhen he left home, or whether one of his companions had given them\nto him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose house\nhe was staying made him a present of them, for he was a man of many\nfriends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a\nsword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with\na shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him on board his ship\nwith every mark of honour. He had a servant with him, a little older\nthan himself, and I can tell you what he was like; his shoulders were\nhunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates,\nand Ulysses treated him with greater familiarity than he did any of\nthe others, as being the most like-minded with himself.\"\n\nPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable\nproofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found\nrelief in tears she said to him, \"Stranger, I was already disposed\nto pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome\nin my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I\ntook them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I gave\nhim also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never\nwelcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out\nfor that detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even\nto mention.\" \n\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure yourself\nfurther by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly\nblame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and borne\nhim children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even though\nhe were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god. Still,\ncease your tears and listen to what I can tell I will hide nothing\nfrom you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately heard\nof Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the Thesprotians,\nand is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from\none and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as\nthey were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god\nwere angry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god's\ncattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the\nkeel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the Phaecians,\nwho are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him as though\nhe had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to escort\nhim home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here long\nago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth;\nfor there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no one\ncan compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all\nthis, and he swore to me- making drink-offerings in his house as he\ndid so- that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who\nwould take Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there\nhappened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island\nof Dulichium, but he showed me all treasure Ulysses had got together,\nand he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family\nfor ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona\nthat he might learn Jove's mind from the high oak tree, and know whether\nafter so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret.\nSo you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at\nhand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I\nwill confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first\nand mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses\nto which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come\nto pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end\nof this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.\"\n\n\"May it be even so,\" answered Penelope; \"if your words come true you\nshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see\nyou shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses\nwill not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for so surely\nas that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such masters\nin the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or to further\nthem on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him,\nand make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may\nbe warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint\nhim again, that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with\nTelemachus. It shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people\nwho is uncivil to him; like it or not, he shall have no more to do\nin this house. For how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether or\nno I am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heart and\nunderstanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad?\nMen live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal hardly,\npeople wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously\nof them when they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously,\nthe people tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call\nhim blessed.\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from\nthe day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard.\nI will lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night\nafter night have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited\nfor morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet washed; I shall\nnot let any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet; but,\nif you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as\nmuch trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them.\" \n\nTo this Penelope said, \"My dear sir, of all the guests who ever yet\ncame to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with\nsuch admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house\na most respectable old woman- the same who received my poor dear husband\nin her arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She\nis very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.\" \"Come here,\" said\nshe, \"Euryclea, and wash your master's age-mate; I suppose Ulysses'\nhands and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble\nages all of us dreadfully fast.\" \n\nOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she\nbegan to weep and made lamentation saying, \"My dear child, I cannot\nthink whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more\ngod-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole\nworld ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs\nwhen you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see\nyour son grow up to take after you; yet see how he has prevented you\nalone from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the\nwomen in some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at\nhim as all these sluts here have been gibing you. I do not wonder\nat your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which\nthey have insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough,\nas Penelope has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for\nPenelope's sake and for your own, for you have raised the most lively\nfeelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which\npray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come\nhere before now, but I make bold to say that no one ever yet came\nwho was so like Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as you are.\"\n\n\"Those who have seen us both,\" answered Ulysses, \"have always said\nwe were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.\n\nThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash\nhis feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot till\nthe bath was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he\nturned away from the light, for it occurred to him that when the old\nwoman had hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar which\nit bore, whereon the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon\nas she began washing her master, she at once knew the scar as one\nthat had been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on Mount\nParnassus with his excellent grandfather Autolycus- who was the most\naccomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world- and with the sons\nof Autolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, for\nhe used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he took\npleasure in his companionship. It happened once that Autolycus had\ngone to Ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born.\nAs soon as he had done supper Euryclea set the infant upon his knees\nand said, you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished\nthat you might have one.\" \n\n'Son-in-law and daughter,\" replied Autolycus, \"call the child thus:\nI am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place\nand another, both men and women; so name the child 'Ulysses,' or the\nchild of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother's family\non Mount Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present\nand will send him on his way rejoicing.\" \n\nUlysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from Autolycus,\nwho with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome. His grandmother\nAmphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head, and both\nhis beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to get dinner\nready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five year old\nbull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it into joints; these they\nthen cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted\nthem sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus through the\nlivelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and every\nman had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun\nset and it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of\nsleep. \n\nWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons\nof Autolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went\ntoo. They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached\nits breezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon\nthe fields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they\ncame to a mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the\ntracks of the beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons\nof Autolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he\nhad a long spear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among\nsome thick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get\nthrough it, nor could the sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneath\nlay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men's\nfeet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up\nto him, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck,\nand stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the\nfirst to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the\nboar was too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him\nabove the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach\nthe bone. As for the boar, Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder,\nand the point of the spear went right through him, so that he fell\ngroaning in the dust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolycus\nbusied themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses'\nwound; then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went\nhome as fast as they could. But when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly\nhealed Ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent him\nback to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, his father\nand mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all about it, and\nhow he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar\nhad ripped him when he was out hunting with Autolycus and his sons\non Mount Parnassus. \n\nAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had\nwell hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. The\nleg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that\nall the water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea's eyes between her\njoy and her grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but\nshe caught Ulysses by the beard and said, \"My dear child, I am sure\nyou must be Ulysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually\ntouched and handled you.\" \n\nAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to tell\nher that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable\nto look in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva\nhad diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat\nwith his right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and said,\n\"Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at your\nown breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last\ncome to my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by\nheaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about\nit any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you- and it shall\nsurely be- that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors,\nI will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing\nthe other women.\" \n\n\"My child,\" answered Euryclea, \"what are you talking about? You know\nvery well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my\ntongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and\nlay my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors\ninto your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who\nhave been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.\" \n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way;\nI am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold\nyour tongue and leave everything to heaven.\" \n\nAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,\nfor the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and\nanointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to\nwarm himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began\ntalking to him and said: \n\n\"Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another matter.\nIt is indeed nearly bed time- for those, at least, who can sleep in\nspite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such\nunmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my duties\nand looking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during\nthe whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed,\nI lie awake thinking, and my heart comes a prey to the most incessant\nand cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus,\nsings in the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and\nwith many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed\nher own child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss\nand turn in its uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here,\nand safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house,\nout of regard to public opinion and the memory of my late husband,\nor whether it is not now time for me to go with the best of these\nsuitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent presents.\nAs long as my son was still young, and unable to understand, he would\nnot hear of my leaving my husband's house, but now that he is full\ngrown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in\nwhich the suitors are eating up his property. Listen, then, to a dream\nthat I have had and interpret it for me if you can. I have twenty\ngeese about the house that eat mash out of a trough, and of which\nI am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great eagle came swooping\ndown from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into the neck of each\nof them till he had killed them all. Presently he soared off into\nthe sky, and left them lying dead about the yard; whereon I wept in\nmy room till all my maids gathered round me, so piteously was I grieving\nbecause the eagle had killed my geese. Then he came back again, and\nperching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice, and\ntold me to leave off crying. 'Be of good courage,' he said, 'daughter\nof Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen that shall\nsurely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no longer\nan eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who will\nbring these suitors to a disgraceful end.' On this I woke, and when\nI looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual.\"\n\n\"This dream, Madam,\" replied Ulysses, \"can admit but of one interpretation,\nfor had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? The\ndeath of the suitors is portended, and not one single one of them\nwill escape.\" \n\nAnd Penelope answered, \"Stranger, dreams are very curious and unaccountable\nthings, and they do not by any means invariably come true. There are\ntwo gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one\nis of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through the gate\nof ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean something\nto those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own dream\ncame through the gate of horn, though I and my son should be most\nthankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say- and lay\nmy saying to your heart- the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened\nday that is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about\nto hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes\nin the court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon which\na ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow\nthrough the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same\nthing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily, and send\nhis arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit\nthis house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth.\nBut even so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\n\nThen Ulysses answered, \"Madam wife of Ulysses, you need not defer\nyour tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string\nthe bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the\niron.\" \n\nTo this Penelope said, \"As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk\nto me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do\npermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on\nearth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline\nupon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from\nthe day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.\"\n\nShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by\nher maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till Minerva\nshed sweet sleep over her eyelids. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XX\n\nUlysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, on\nthe top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had\neaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself\ndown. There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in\nwhich he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had\nbeen in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the\nhouse giggling and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very\nangry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one\nof them then and there, or to let them sleep one more and last time\nwith the suitors. His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with\npuppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did\nhis heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done:\nbut he beat his breast and said, \"Heart, be still, you had worse than\nthis to bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions;\nyet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe out of the\ncave, though you made sure of being killed.\" \n\nThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but\nhe tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in\nfront of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other,\nthat he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn\nhimself about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single\nhanded as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men\nas the wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven\nin the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, \"My\npoor unhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house:\nyour wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a\nyoung man as any father may be proud of.\" \n\n\"Goddess,\" answered Ulysses, \"all that you have said is true, but\nI am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked\nsuitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are.\nAnd there is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable.\nSupposing that with Jove's and your assistance I succeed in killing\nthem, I must ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their\navengers when it is all over.\" \n\n\"For shame,\" replied Minerva, \"why, any one else would trust a worse\nally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less\nwise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout\nin all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though there were\nfifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should\ntake all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you. But\ngo to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and you\nshall be out of your troubles before long.\" \n\nAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to Olympus.\n\nWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that\neased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting\nup in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping\nshe prayed to Diana saying, \"Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove,\ndrive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch\nme up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the\nmouths of overflowing Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus.\nThe daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods\nkilled them, so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them,\nand fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them to\nexcel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them\nan imposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of\naccomplishment; but one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see\nJove about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall\nhappen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came and\nspirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even\nso I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal\nsight, or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain go even\nbeneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses\nonly, and without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was.\nBesides, no matter how much people may grieve by day, they can put\nup with it so long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are\nclosed in slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my misery\nhaunts me even in my dreams. This very night methought there was one\nlying by my side who was like Ulysses as he was when he went away\nwith his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream,\nbut the very truth itself.\" \n\nOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping,\nand it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and\nwas by his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on\nwhich he had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he\ntook the bullock's hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands\nto heaven, and prayed, saying \"Father Jove, since you have seen fit\nto bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the afflictions\nyou have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one\nor other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me\nhave another sign of some kind from outside.\" \n\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high\nup among the from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad when\nhe heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman from\nhard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another\nsign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind\nwheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground\ntheir task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet\nfinished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard\nthe thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.\n\"Father Jove,\" said she, \"you who rule over heaven and earth, you\nhave thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it,\nand this means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of\nme your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very\nlast day that the suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have\nworn me out with the labour of grinding meal for them, and I hope\nthey may never have another dinner anywhere at all.\" \n\nUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman's\nspeech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should\navenge himself on the suitors. \n\nThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;\nTelemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about\nhis shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, and took a doughty\nspear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold\nof the cloister and said to Euryclea, \"Nurse, did you make the stranger\ncomfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him shift\nfor himself?- for my mother, good woman though she is, has a way of\npaying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting others\nwho are in reality much better men.\" \n\n\"Do not find fault child,\" said Euryclea, \"when there is no one to\nfind fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he\nliked: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and\nhe said he would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants\nto make one for him, but he said he was re such wretched outcast that\nhe would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having\nan undressed bullock's hide and some sheepskins put for him in the\ncloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.\" \n\nThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans\nwere meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was\nnot alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the\nmaids and said, \"Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and\nsprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the\nseats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean\nout the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for water from the fountain\nat once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early,\nfor it is a feast day.\" \n\nThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them\nwent to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily\nto work about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors\nalso came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned\nfrom the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three\nbest pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises,\nand then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses, \"Stranger, are the suitors\ntreating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?\"\n\n\"May heaven,\" answered Ulysses, \"requite to them the wickedness with\nwhich they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any sense\nof shame.\" \n\nThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up,\nfor he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors' dinner;\nand he had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the\ngatehouse, and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. \"Are you still\nhere, stranger,\" said he, \"to pester people by begging about the house?\nWhy can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding\nbefore we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without\nany sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans,\nas well as here?\" \n\nUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third\nman, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer\nand some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there\nto take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made\nhis heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went\nup to the swineherd. \"Who, Swineherd,\" said he, \"is this stranger\nthat is lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family?\nWhere does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some\ngreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will- even to kings\nif it so pleases them \n\nAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;\n\"Good day to you, father stranger,\" said he, \"you seem to be very\npoorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father\nJove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children,\nyet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat\ncame over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for\nhe reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about in just such rags\nas this man's are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is\nalready dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,\nwho made me his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephallenians,\nand now his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with\nthem than I have, for they have bred like ears of corn; nevertheless\nI have to keep bringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed\nof his son though he is in the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven,\nbut are already eager to divide Ulysses' property among them because\nhe has been away so long. I have often thought- only it would not\nbe right while his son is living- of going off with the cattle to\nsome foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still harder to\nstay here and be ill-treated about other people's herds. My position\nis intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself\nunder the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor\nmaster will yet return, and send all these suitors flying out of the\nhouse.\" \n\n\"Stockman,\" answered Ulysses, \"you seem to be a very well-disposed\nperson, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will\ntell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by Jove, the chief\nof all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come,\nUlysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so\nminded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.\"\n\n\"If Jove were to bring this to pass,\" replied the stockman, \"you should\nsee how I would do my very utmost to help him.\" \n\nAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.\n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot\nto murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand-\nan eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, \"My friends,\nthis plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go\nto dinner instead.\" \n\nThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on\nthe benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and\nthe heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them\nround. They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd\ngave every man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in\nthe breadbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then\nthey laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\n\nTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister\nthat was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a\nlittle table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought\nto him, with his wine in a gold cup. \"Sit there,\" said he, \"and drink\nyour wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and\nblows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to\nUlysses, and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors, keep your\nhands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief.\"\n\nThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;\nthen Antinous said, \"We do not like such language but we will put\nup with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If Jove\nhad let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.\"\n\nThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the\nheralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the\nAchaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo. \n\nThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every\nman his portion, and feasted to their hearts' content; those who waited\nat table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had,\nfor Telemachus had told them to do so. \n\nBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence,\nfor she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against them. Now\nthere happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Ctesippus,\nand who came from Same. This man, confident in his great wealth, was\npaying court to the wife of Ulysses, and said to the suitors, \"Hear\nwhat I have to say. The stranger has already had as large a portion\nas any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor reasonable\nto ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I will, however,\nmake him a present on my own account, that he may have something to\ngive to the bath-woman, or to some other of Ulysses' servants.\"\n\nAs he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket in which\nit lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little\naside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion as he did\nso, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely\nto Ctesippus, \"It is a good thing for you,\" said he, \"that the stranger\nturned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should\nhave run you through with my spear, and your father would have had\nto see about getting you buried rather than married in this house.\nSo let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am\ngrown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what\nis going on, instead of being the child that I have been heretofore.\nI have long seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn\nand wine: I have put up with this, for one man is no match for many,\nbut do me no further violence. Still, if you wish to kill me, kill\nme; I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after\nday- guests insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the\nhouse in an unseemly way.\" \n\nThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,\n\"No one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay\nit, for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating\nthe stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house;\nI would say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother,\nwhich I trust may commend itself to both. 'As long,' I would say,\n'as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home,\nno one could complain of your waiting and suffering the suitors to\nbe in your house. It would have been better that he should have returned,\nbut it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore\ntalk all this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry\nthe best man, and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer.\nThus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and\nto eat and drink in peace, while your mother will look after some\nother man's house, not yours.\"' \n\nTo this Telemachus answered, \"By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows\nof my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or\nis wandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way\nof my mother's marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever\nshe will, and I will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but\nI dare not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against\nher own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do this.\" \n\nMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and set\ntheir wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.\nTheir meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears,\nand their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this\nand said, \"Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud\nof darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are wet\nwith tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams\ndrip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are\nfull of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted\nout of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus\nthen said, \"This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses.\nServants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark\nhere.\" \n\nBut Theoclymenus said, \"Eurymachus, you need not send any one with\nme. I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing\nof an understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with\nme, for I see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you\nmen who are insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of\nUlysses will be able to escape.\" \n\nHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him\nwelcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking\nTelemachus fly laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said\nto him, \"Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have\nthis importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and has no\nskill for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and\nnow here is another fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet.\nLet me persuade you, for it will be much better, to put them on board\nship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.\"\n\nTelemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father,\nexpecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.\n\nMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had had a rich\nseat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could\nhear what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared\namid merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed\nmany victims; but the supper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived\nmore gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man were soon\nto lay before them- for they had brought their doom upon themselves.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XXI\n\nMinerva now put it in Penelope's mind to make the suitors try their\nskill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,\nas a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs\nand got the store room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle\nof ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store room at the\nend of the house, where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and\nwrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver\nfull of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he\nhad met in Lacedaemon- Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in\nwith one another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses\nwas staying in order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole\npeople; for the Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from\nIthaca, and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In\nquest of these Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young,\nfor his father and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover\nthem. Iphitus had gone there also to try and get back twelve brood\nmares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running with\nthem. These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went\nto the house of Jove's son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies\nof valour, Hercules to his shame killed him, though he was his guest,\nfor he feared not heaven's vengeance, nor yet respected his own table\nwhich he had set before Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything,\nand kept the mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus\nmet Ulysses, and gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used\nto carry, and which on his death had been left by him to his son.\nUlysses gave him in return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning\nof a fast friendship, although they never visited at one another's\nhouses, for Jove's son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so.\nThis bow, then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him\nby Ulysses when he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had\nbeen at home, but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from\na valued friend. \n\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room; the\ncarpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to\nget it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and\nhung the doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door,\nput in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts\nthat held the doors; these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing\nin a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where\nthe chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by\nalong with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow\nwith its bow case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with\nit on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case,\nand when her tears had relieved her, she went to the cloister where\nthe suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly\narrows that were inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing\na chest that contained much iron and bronze which her husband had\nwon as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the\nbearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil\nbefore her face, and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:\n\n\"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality\nof this house because its owner has been long absent, and without\nother pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the\nprize that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow\nof Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and\nsend his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow\nand quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding\nin wealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my\ndreams.\" \n\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron\nbefore the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she\nhad bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master's\nbow, but Antinous scolded them. \"You country louts,\" said he, \"silly\nsimpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by\ncrying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her\nhusband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or\ngo outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors\nshall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find\nit no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a\nman of us all who is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him\nand remember him, though I was then only a child.\" \n\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able\nto string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was\nto be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of\nUlysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house- egging the others\non to do so also. \n\nThen Telemachus spoke. \"Great heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"Jove must have\nrobbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying\nshe will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying\nmyself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the\ncontest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman\nwhose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet\nin Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what\nneed have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no\nexcuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or\nno. I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot\nthrough the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house\nwith a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father won before\nme.\" \n\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from\nhim, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in\na row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had Wade straight\nby line. Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone\nwas surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had never\nseen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement\nto make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all\nhis might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though\nhe had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was\ntrying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses\nmade a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\n\n\"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am\ntoo young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able\nto hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are\nstronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.\"\n\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that\nled into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the\nbow. Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous\nsaid: \n\n\"Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the\nplace at which the. cupbearer begins when he is handing round the\nwine.\" \n\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of OEnops was the first to rise.\nHe was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near\nthe mixing-bowl. He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and\nwas indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow\nand arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he\ncould not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard\nwork, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors,\n\"My friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall\ntake the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better\nto die than to live after having missed the prize that we have so\nlong striven for, and which has brought us so long together. Some\none of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope,\nbut when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal\nofferings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever makes\nher the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.\" \n\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, with\nthe arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat\nagain on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him\nsaying: \n\n\"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and\nintolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this\nbow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot\nbend it yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there\nare others who will soon string it.\" \n\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, \"Look sharp, light a fire\nin the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring\nus also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let\nus warm the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again,\nand bring the contest to an end.\" \n\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside\nit. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the\nhouse, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it,\nbut they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless\nthere still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders\namong the suitors and much the foremost among them all. \n\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and\nUlysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the\nouter yard, Ulysses said to them quietly: \n\n\"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I\nam in doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What\nmanner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should\nbring him back here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to\ndo- to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?\" \n\n\"Father Jove,\" answered the stockman, \"would indeed that you might\nso ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should\nsee with what might and main I would fight for him.\" \n\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return;\nwhen, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses\nsaid, \"It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at\nlast, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find\nthat you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so,\nfor I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you\ntwo, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven\nshall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both\nof you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall\nbe to me as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I\nwill now give you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured.\nSee, here is the scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I\nwas out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they\nhad examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses,\nthrew their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while\nUlysses kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have\ngone down upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and\nsaid: \n\n\"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us,\nand tell those who a are within. When you go in, do so separately,\nnot both together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards;\nLet this moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of\nthem try to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do\nyou, therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying\nit about, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment.\nIf they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house,\nthey must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they\nare at their work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the\ndoors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat\nthat he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\n\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming\nit by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly\ngrieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I grieve for myself and\nfor us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but\nI do not care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other\nwomen in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our\nbeing so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his\nbow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.\"\n\n\"It shall not be so, Eurymachus,\" said Antinous, \"and you know it\nyourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who\ncan string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side- as for\nthe axes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come\nto the house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his\ncups, that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of\nthe bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow-\nthe best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty\narcher, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest\nto an end.\" \n\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water\nover the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls\nwith wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his\ndrink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk\neach as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said: \n\n\"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as\nI am minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous\nwho has just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present\nand leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give\nvictory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow\nthat I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether\nI still have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel\nand neglect have made an end of it.\" \n\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the\nbow; Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, \"Wretched creature,\nyou have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought\nto think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your\nbetters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others\nhave had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other\nbeggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves;\nthe wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all\nthose drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion\nwhen he was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine\nhad got into his head he went mad and did ill deeds about the house\nof Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so\nthey rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged\nhim through the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed,\nand bore the burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth,\ntherefore, there was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he\nbrought it upon himself through his own drunkenness. In like manner\nI can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow:\nyou will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship\nyou off to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him:\nyou will never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting\ninto a quarrel with men younger than yourself.\" \n\nPenelope then spoke to him. \"Antinous,\" said she, \"it is not right\nthat you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this\nhouse. If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty\nbow of Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him\nand make me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in\nhis mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would\nbe out of all reason.\" \n\n\"Queen Penelope,\" answered Eurymachus, \"we do not suppose that this\nman will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid\nlest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should\ngo gossiping about and say, 'These suitors are a feeble folk; they\nare paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them\nwas able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house\nstrung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.' This is what\nwill be said, and it will be a scandal against us.\" \n\n\"Eurymachus,\" Penelope answered, \"people who persist in eating up\nthe estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not\nexpect others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men\ntalk as you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built,\nhe says moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and\nlet us see whether he can string it or no. I say- and it shall surely\nbe- that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will\ngive him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off\ndogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals,\nand will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go.\" \n\nThen Telemachus said, \"Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca\nor in the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to\nlet any one have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one\nway or the other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a\npresent of the bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go,\nthen, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your\nloom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is\na man's matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master\nhere.\" \n\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying\nin her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,\nshe mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her\neyelids. \n\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses,\nbut the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters,\nand one of them said, \"You idiot, where are you taking the bow to?\nAre you out of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant\nour prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little\nplace, and worry you to death.\" \n\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the\nbow down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the\nother side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, \"Father Eumaeus,\nbring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you\nwith stones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two.\nI wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house\nas I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry,\nfor they mean mischief.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put\nthem in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow\non and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he\ncalled Euryclea apart and said to her, \"Euryclea, Telemachus says\nyou are to close the doors of the women's apartments. If they hear\nany groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are\nnot to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at\ntheir work.\" \n\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women's apartments.\n\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of\nthe outer court. There was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lying in\nthe gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in\nagain, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses,\nwho had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way\nabout, and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating\ninto its two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards\nhis neighbour saying, \"This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either\nhe has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\nstyle does the old vagabond handle it.\" \n\nAnother said, \"I hope he may be no more successful in other things\nthan he is likely to be in stringing this bow.\" \n\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung\nit as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes\nthe twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand\nto prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the\ntwittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour\nas they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly\nas a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen\nthat the son of scheming Saturn had sent him. \n\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those which the\nAchaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver-\nhe laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the\narrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he\nhad taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes\nof the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through\nthem, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:\n\n\"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what\nI aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,\nand not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time\nfor the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight,\nand then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which\nare the crowning ornaments of a banquet.\" \n\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded\non his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father's\nseat. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XXII\n\nThen Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad pavement\nwith his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on\nto the ground at his feet and said, \"The mighty contest is at an end.\nI will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another\nmark which no man has yet hit.\" \n\nOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take\nup a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in\nhis hands. He had no thought of death- who amongst all the revellers\nwould think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among so\nmany and kill him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the\npoint went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup\ndropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his\nnostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on it,\nso that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over\non to the ground. The suitors were in an uproar when they saw that\na man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of them from\ntheir seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but there was\nneither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily. \"Stranger,\"\nsaid they, \"you shall pay for shooting people in this way: om yi you\nshall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you have\nslain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour\nyou for having killed him.\" \n\nThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by mistake,\nand did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every\none of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said: \n\n\"Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have\nwasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you,\nand have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared neither\nCod nor man, and now you shall die.\" \n\nThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round\nabout to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone\nspoke. \n\n\"If you are Ulysses,\" said he, \"then what you have said is just. We\nhave done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous\nwho was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was\nall his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did\nnot so much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different,\nand Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son\nand to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met the\ndeath which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make\neverything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that\nwe have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth\ntwenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your\nheart is softened. Until we have done this no one can complain of\nyour being enraged against us.\" \n\nUlysses again glared at him and said, \"Though you should give me all\nthat you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have,\nI will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must\nfight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall.\"\n\nTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:\n\n\"My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where\nhe is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let\nus then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield\nyou from his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him\nfrom the pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town,\nand raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides,\nand with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly\nshot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed\nitself in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over\nhis table. The cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as\nhe smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and\nhe kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.\n\nThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try\nand get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him,\nand struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders\nand went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground\nand struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away\nfrom him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that\nif he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up\nand hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he set off at\na run, and immediately was at his father's side. Then he said:\n\n\"Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet\nfor your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other\narmour for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.\"\n\n\"Run and fetch them,\" answered Ulysses, \"while my arrows hold out,\nor when I am alone they may get me away from the door.\" \n\nTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room\nwhere the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and\nfour brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all\nspeed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and\nthe swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places near\nUlysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been\nshooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another:\nwhen his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end\nwall of the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick\nabout his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought\nwith a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he\ngrasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears. \n\nNow there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of the pavement\nthere was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed\nby a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door\nand guard it, for only one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaus\nshouted out, \"Cannot some one go up to the trap door and tell the\npeople what is going on? Help would come at once, and we should soon\nmake an end of this man and his shooting.\" \n\n\"This may not be, Agelaus,\" answered Melanthius, \"the mouth of the\nnarrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court.\nOne brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know\nwhat I will do, I will bring you arms from the store room, for I am\nsure it is there that Ulysses and his son have put them.\"\n\nOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store\nroom of Ulysses, house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many\nhelmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give\nthem to the suitors. Ulysses' heart began to fail him when he saw\nthe suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears.\nHe saw the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, \"Some\none of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may\nbe Melanthius.\" \n\nTelemachus answered, \"The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I\nleft the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out\nthan I have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one\nof the women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius\nthe son of Dolius.\" \n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the\nstore room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said\nto Ulysses who was beside him, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it\nis that scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to\nthe store room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of\nhim, or shall I bring him here that you may take your own revenge\nfor all the many wrongs that he has done in your house?\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check,\nno matter what they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius' hands\nand feet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door\nfast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him\nclose up to the rafters from a high bearing-post, that he may linger\non in an agony.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to\nthe store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for\nhe was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room,\nso the two took their stand on either side of the door and waited.\nBy and by Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old\ndry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when\nhe was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the\nstraps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him\nback by the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent\nhis hands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with\na painful bond as Ulysses had told them; then they fastened a noose\nabout his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he was close\nup to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus,\nsaying, \"Melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as you\ndeserve. You will know very well when morning comes from the streams\nof Oceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for\nthe suitors to feast on.\" \n\nThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on\ntheir armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take\ntheir places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in\nthe cloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were\nin the body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove's\ndaughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form\nof Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, \"Mentor, lend\nme your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns\nhe has done you. Besides, you are my age-mate.\" \n\nBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from\nthe other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the\nfirst to reproach her. \"Mentor,\" he cried, \"do not let Ulysses beguile\nyou into siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we\nwill do: when we have killed these people, father and son, we will\nkill you too. You shall pay for it with your head, and when we have\nkilled you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and bring\nit into hotch-pot with Ulysses' property; we will not let your sons\nlive in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue\nto live in the city of Ithaca.\" \n\nThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very\nangrily. \"Ulysses,\" said she, \"your strength and prowess are no longer\nwhat they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojans\nabout the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those days, and\nit was through your stratagem that Priam's city was taken. How comes\nit that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your\nown ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? Come\non, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alcinous\nshall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him.\"\n\nBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still\nfurther to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she\nflew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat\nupon it in the form of a swallow. \n\nMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,\nPisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight\nupon the suitors' side; of all those who were still fighting for their\nlives they were by far the most valiant, for the others had already\nfallen under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said,\n\"My friends, he will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away\nafter having done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the\ndoors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw\nyour spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory\nby killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the\nothers.\" \n\nThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all\nof no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door;\nthe pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they\nhad avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own\nmen, \"My friends, I should say we too had better let drive into the\nmiddle of them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us\nby us outright.\" \n\nThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.\nUlysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus,\nwhile the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as\nthe others drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward\nand regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.\n\nThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their\nweapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of\nthe cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft\nof another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of\nthe top skin from off Telemachus's wrist, and Ctesippus managed to\ngraze Eumaeus's shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and\nfell to the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd\nof suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus\nPolybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and\ntaunted him saying, \"Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so\nfoolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your\nspeech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present\nof this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when\nhe was begging about in his own house.\" \n\nThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with\na spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor\nin the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell\nforward full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat\non the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors\nquailed. They fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle\nmaddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their\nlongest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains\nswoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground,\nand kill them, for they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on\nenjoy the sport- even so did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors\nand smite them on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their\nbrains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood.\n\nLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, \"Ulysses I beseech\nyou have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women\nin your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others.\nI saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for\ntheir folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall\ndie without having done anything to deserve it, and shall have got\nno thanks for all the good that I did.\" \n\nUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, \"If you were their sacrificing\npriest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before\nI got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have children\nby her. Therefore you shall die.\" \n\nWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when\nhe was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he\nstruck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell rolling\nin the dust while he was yet speaking. \n\nThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes- he who had been forced by the\nsuitors to sing to them- now tried to save his life. He was standing\nnear towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. He did\nnot know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar\nof Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and\nUlysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to\ngo straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he\ndeemed it best to embrace Ulysses' knees. So he laid his lyre on the\nground the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded seat;\nthen going up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, \"Ulysses,\nI beseech you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for\nit afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both for gods and men\nas I can. I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits me with every\nkind of inspiration. I would sing to you as though you were a god,\ndo not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your own son\nTelemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent your house\nand sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many\nand too strong for me, so they made me.\" \n\nTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. \"Hold!\" he\ncried, \"the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will Medon too,\nwho was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus\nhas already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you were\nraging about the court.\" \n\nMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under\na seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly\nflayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus,\nand laid hold of his knees. \n\n\"Here I am, my dear sir,\" said he, \"stay your hand therefore, and\ntell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors\nfor having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful\nto yourself.\" \n\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \"Fear not; Telemachus has saved\nyour life, that you may know in future, and tell other people, how\ngreatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside\nthe cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way of the slaughter-\nyou and the bard- while I finish my work here inside.\" \n\nThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat\ndown by Jove's great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting\nthat they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully\nover, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living,\nbut he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood.\nThey were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea,\nand thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of\nthe sun makes an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying all huddled\nup one against the other. \n\nThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, \"Call nurse Euryclea; I have something\nto say to her.\" \n\nTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. \"Make\nhaste,\" said he, \"you old woman who have been set over all the other\nwomen in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you.\"\n\nWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's room\nand came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses\nbespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring\nan ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so that\nhe is a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses besmirched from head to\nfoot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of\nblood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great\ndeed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, \"Old woman,\" said he,\n\"rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise\nabout it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven's doom\nand their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction, for\nthey respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who\ncame near them, and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for\ntheir wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women\nin the house have misconducted themselves, and who are innocent.\"\n\n\"I will tell you the truth, my son,\" answered Euryclea. \"There are\nfifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding\nwool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all have\nmisbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope.\nThey showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only lately grown\nand his mother never permitted him to give orders to the female servants;\nbut let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that has happened, for\nsome god has been sending her to sleep.\" \n\n\"Do not wake her yet,\" answered Ulysses, \"but tell the women who have\nmisconducted themselves to come to me.\" \n\nEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to\nUlysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the\nswineherd. \"Begin,\" said he, \"to remove the dead, and make the women\nhelp you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables\nand seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters,\ntake the women into the space between the domed room and the wall\nof the outer court, and run them through with your swords till they\nare quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in which\nthey used to lie in secret with the suitors.\" \n\nOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.\nFirst they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against\none another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made\nthem do their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When\nthey had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges\nand water, while Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood\nand dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away and put\nit out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean\nand orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow\nspace between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so\nthat they could not get away: and Telemachus said to the other two,\n\"I shall not let these women die a clean death, for they were insolent\nto me and my mother, and used to sleep with the suitors.\"\n\nSo saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing-posts\nthat supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around\nthe building, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should\ntouch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that\nhas been set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their\nnest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have\nto put their heads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably.\nTheir feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.\n\nAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner\ncourt. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his\nvitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they\ncut off his hands and his feet. \n\nWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went\nback into the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the\ndear old nurse Euryclea, \"Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution,\nand fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters.\nGo, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants,\nand also all the maid servants that are in the house.\" \n\n\"All that you have said is true,\" answered Euryclea, \"but let me bring\nyou some clean clothes- a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags\non your back any longer. It is not right.\" \n\n\"First light me a fire,\" replied Ulysses. \nShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and Ulysses\nthoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts.\nThen she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened;\nwhereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands,\nand pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders\nand taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like\nto weep, for he remembered every one of them. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XXIII\n\nEuryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her\ndear husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and\nher feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent\nover her head to speak to her. \"Wake up Penelope, my dear child,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"and see with your own eyes something that you have\nbeen wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come\nhome again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble\nin his house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son.\"\n\n\"My good nurse,\" answered Penelope, \"you must be mad. The gods sometimes\nsend some very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish\npeople become sensible. This is what they must have been doing to\nyou; for you always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you\nthus mock me when I have trouble enough already- talking such nonsense,\nand waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of\nmy eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from the day\nmy poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back\nagain into the women's room; if it had been any one else, who had\nwoke me up to bring me such absurd news I should have sent her away\nwith a severe scolding. As it is, your age shall protect you.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" answered Euryclea, \"I am not mocking you. It is quite\ntrue as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger\nwhom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus\nknew all the time that he was come back, but kept his father's secret\nthat he might have his revenge on all these wicked people.\n\nThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea,\nand wept for joy. \"But my dear nurse,\" said she, \"explain this to\nme; if he has really come home as you say, how did he manage to overcome\nthe wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there\nalways were?\" \n\n\"I was not there,\" answered Euryclea, \"and do not know; I only heard\nthem groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled\nup in a corner of the women's room with the doors closed, till your\nson came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found Ulysses\nstanding over the corpses that were lying on the ground all round\nhim, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you could\nhave seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and filth,\nand looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled up\nin the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a\ngreat fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call\nyou, so come with me that you may both be happy together after all;\nfor now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your\nhusband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, and\nto take his revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so\nbadly to him.\" \n\n\"'My dear nurse,\" said Penelope, \"do not exult too confidently over\nall this. You know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses\ncome home- more particularly myself, and the son who has been born\nto both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some\ngod who is angry with the suitors for their great wickedness, and\nhas made an end of them; for they respected no man in the whole world,\nneither rich nor poor, who came near them, who came near them, and\nthey have come to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity. Ulysses\nis dead far away from the Achaean land; he will never return home\nagain.\" \n\nThen nurse Euryclea said, \"My child, what are you talking about? but\nyou were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband\nis never coming, although he is in the house and by his own fire side\nat this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof; when I\nwas washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave him,\nand I wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not\nlet me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I\nwill make this bargain with you- if I am deceiving you, you may have\nme killed by the most cruel death you can think of.\" \n\n\"My dear nurse,\" said Penelope, \"however wise you may be you can hardly\nfathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search\nof my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man\nwho has killed them.\" \n\nOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she\nconsidered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband\nand question him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace\nhim. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister,\nshe sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the wall at right\nangles [to that by which she had entered], while Ulysses sat near\none of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting to\nsee what his wife would say to him when she saw him. For a long time\nshe sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked\nhim full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his\nshabby clothes and failed to recognize him, till Telemachus began\nto reproach her and said: \n\n\"Mother- but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name-\nwhy do you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit\nby his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions? No\nother woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come\nback to her after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through\nso much; but your heart always was as hard as a stone.\" \n\nPenelope answered, \"My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can\nfind no words in which either to ask questions or to answer them.\nI cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is\nUlysses come back to his own home again, we shall get to understand\none another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we two\nare alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others.\"\n\nUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, \"Let your mother put\nme to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently.\nShe rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else,\nbecause I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us,\nhowever, consider what we had better do next. When one man has killed\nanother, even though he was not one who would leave many friends to\ntake up his quarrel, the man who has killed him must still say good\nbye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing\nthe stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would\nhave you consider this matter.\" \n\n\"Look to it yourself, father,\" answered Telemachus, \"for they say\nyou are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other\nmortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right\ngood will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength\nholds out.\" \n\n\"I will say what I think will be best,\" answered Ulysses. \"First wash\nand put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room\nand dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre,\nso that if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some\none going along the street happens to notice it, they may think there\nis a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the death of the suitors\nwill get about in the town, before we can escape to the woods upon\nmy own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven\nvouchsafes us shall seem wisest.\" \n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed\nand put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took\nhis lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance.\nThe house re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the\npeople outside said, \"I suppose the queen has been getting married\nat last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to\nprotect her husband's property until he comes home.\" \n\nThis was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had\nbeen happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses\nin his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made\nhim look taller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow\nthick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth\nblossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a\nskilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva-\nand his work is full of beauty- enriches a piece of silver plate by\ngilding it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals,\nand sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. \"My dear,\"\nsaid he, \"heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than\nwoman ever yet had. No other woman could bear to keep away from her\nhusband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence,\nand after having gone through so much. But come, nurse, get a bed\nready for me; I will sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard\nas iron.\" \n\n\"My dear,\" answered Penelope, \"I have no wish to set myself up, nor\nto depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very\nwell remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.\nNevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that\nhe himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding\nupon it with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.\" \n\nShe said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, \"Wife,\nI am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has been\ntaking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found\nit a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some\ngod came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living, however\nstrong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for it\nis a marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands. There\nwas a young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full\nvigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round\nthis with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them, and I made\nthe doors strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of\nthe olive tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly\nfrom the root upwards and then worked with carpenter's tools well\nand skilfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood,\nand making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle,\nand made it the centre-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had\nfinished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched\na hide of crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you\nsee I know all about it, and I desire to learn whether it is still\nthere, or whether any one has been removing it by cutting down the\nolive tree at its roots.\" \n\nWhen she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke\ndown. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck,\nand kissed him. \"Do not be angry with me Ulysses,\" she cried, \"you,\nwho are the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven\nhas denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing\nold, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did\nnot embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering\nall the time through fear that someone might come here and deceive\nme with a lying story; for there are many very wicked people going\nabout. Jove's daughter Helen would never have yielded herself to a\nman from a foreign country, if she had known that the sons of Achaeans\nwould come after her and bring her back. Heaven put it in her heart\nto do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin, which has been the\nsource of all our sorrows. Now, however, that you have convinced me\nby showing that you know all about our bed (which no human being has\never seen but you and I and a single maid servant, the daughter of\nActor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who keeps\nthe doors of our room) hard of belief though I have been I can mistrust\nno longer.\" \n\nThen Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and\nfaithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men\nwho are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their\nship with the fury of his winds and waves- a few alone reach the land,\nand these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves\non firm ground and out of danger- even so was her husband welcome\nto her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear her two fair\narms from about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging\ntheir sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined\notherwise, and held night back in the far west, while she would not\nsuffer Dawn to leave Oceanus, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampus and\nPhaethon that bear her onward to break the day upon mankind.\n\nAt last, however, Ulysses said, \"Wife, we have not yet reached the\nend of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo.\nIt is long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus\nthe shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I\nwent down into Hades to ask about my return and that of my companions.\nBut now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed\nboon of sleep.\" \n\n\"You shall go to bed as soon as you please,\" replied Penelope, \"now\nthat the gods have sent you home to your own good house and to your\ncountry. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, tell\nme about the task that lies before you. I shall have to hear about\nit later, so it is better that I should be told at once.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" answered Ulysses, \"why should you press me to tell you?\nStill, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it.\nI do not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide,\ncarrying an oar, till I came to a country where the people have never\nheard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food. They know\nnothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He\ngave me this certain token which I will not hide from you. He said\nthat a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing\nshovel that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my oar in\nthe ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune; after\nwhich I was to go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven,\none after the other. As for myself, he said that death should come\nto me from the sea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when\nI was full of years and peace of mind, and my people should bless\nme. All this, he said, should surely come to pass.\" \n\nAnd Penelope said, \"If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier\ntime in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from\nmisfortune.\" \n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches\nand made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid\nthem, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving\nthe bed chamber woman Eurynome to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed\nby torch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went\nback, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and\nmade the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep\nin the cloisters. \n\nWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking\nwith one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing\nthe house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so\nmany sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many casks of\nwine. Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much\ntrouble he had himself given to other people. He told her everything,\nand she was so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till\nhe had ended his whole story. \n\nHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached\nthe fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops\nand how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave\ncomrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably\nand furthered him on his way, but even so he was not to reach home,\nfor to his great grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how\nhe went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed\nall his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only.\nThen he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to\nthe chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet\nTeiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother\nwho bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard\nthe wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks\nand terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed\nin safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how\nJove therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, so that all\nhis men perished together, himself alone being left alive; how at\nlast he reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso, who kept\nhim there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted him to marry her, in\nwhich case she intended making him immortal so that he should never\ngrow old, but she could not persuade him to let her do so; and how\nafter much suffering he had found his way to the Phaeacians, who had\ntreated him as though he had been a god, and sent him back in a ship\nto his own country after having given him gold, bronze, and raiment\nin great abundance. This was the last thing about which he told her,\nfor here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his\nsorrows. \n\nThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that\nUlysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned\nDawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On\nthis, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope,\n\"Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here,\nin lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home\nthough I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however, that we\nhave at last come together, take care of the property that is in the\nhouse. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten,\nI will take many myself by force from other people, and will compel\nthe Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall have filled all\nmy yards. I am now going to the wooded lands out in the country to\nsee my father who has so long been grieved on my account, and to yourself\nI will give these instructions, though you have little need of them.\nAt sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have been killing the\nsuitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there with your women. See\nnobody and ask no questions.\" \n\nAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus, Philoetius,\nand Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also. This they\ndid, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they opened the\ngates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now daylight,\nbut Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led them quickly\nout of the town. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XXIV\n\nThen Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in\nhis hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyes\nin sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the\nghosts and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind\nhim. As bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when\none of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even\nso did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow\nled them down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the\nwaters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the gates of the\nsun and the land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel\nwhere dwell the souls and shadows of them that can labour no more.\n\nHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of\nPatroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest\nman of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself. \n\nThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost\nof Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered\nalso the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of\nAeisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first. \n\n\"Son of Atreus,\" it said, \"we used to say that Jove had loved you\nbetter from first to last than any other hero, for you were captain\nover many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before\nTroy; yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid\nupon you all too early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the\nhey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound\nover your ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good name,\nwhereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.\"\n\n\"Happy son of Peleus,\" answered the ghost of Agamemnon, \"for having\ndied at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and\nthe Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay\nin the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now\nof your chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should\nwe ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us.\nThen, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid\nyou on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with\nointments. The Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about\nyou. Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from\nout of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing went forth over the\nwaters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled\npanic-stricken to their ships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel\nwas ever truest checked them saying, 'Hold, Argives, fly not sons\nof the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea with her immortal\nnymphs to view the body of her son.' \n\n\"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of\nthe old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed\nyou in immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their\nsweet voices in lament- calling and answering one another; there was\nnot an Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and\nnights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on\nthe eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep\nwith many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt\nin raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,\nhorse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning,\nwith the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven\nhad done their work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and\nlaid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a\ngolden vase to hold them- gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself;\nin this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus who\nhad gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those of Antilochus,\nwho had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that\nPatroclus was no more. \n\n\"Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point\njutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far\nout upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born\nhereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them\nto be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have\nbeen present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird\nthemselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some\ngreat chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis\noffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in\ndeath your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives\nevermore among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when\nthe days of my fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction\non my return, by the hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.\"\n\nThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with\nthe ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts\nof Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went\nup to them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son\nof Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began\nto talk to him. \n\n\"Amphimedon,\" it said, \"what has happened to all you fine young men-\nall of an age too- that you are come down here under the ground? One\ncould pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his\nwinds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies\nmake an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or\nsheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of their wives and city?\nAnswer my question, for I have been your guest. Do you not remember\nhow I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to join\nus with his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could\nresume our voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come\nwith us.\" \n\nAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, \"Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king\nof men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you\nfully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.\nUlysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did\nnot say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters\nto an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this, then, was\nthe trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room\nand began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweethearts,'\nsaid she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry\nagain immediately; wait- for I would not have my skill in needlework\nperish unrecorded- till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,\nagainst the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the\nwomen of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' This\nis what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working\nupon her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the\nstitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three\nyears without our finding it out, but as time wore on and she was\nnow in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many days had been\naccomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us,\nand we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish\nit whether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had\nmade, after she had had it washed, its splendour was as that of the\nsun or moon. \n\n\"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where\nhis swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning\nfrom a voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had\nhatched their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and\nthen after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in\nrags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar.\nHe came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older\nones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured\nboth being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his\nown house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he\nand Telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting\nthe doors behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow\nand a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors;\nand this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string\nthe bow- nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the hands of\nUlysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him,\nno matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having\nit. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent\nhis arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister\nand poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First\nhe killed Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly\nhis deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain\nthat some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us\nwith might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous\nsound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the ground\nseethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end,\nand our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the house of Ulysses,\nfor our friends at home do not yet know what has happened, so that\nthey cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our wounds, making\nmoan over us according to the offices due to the departed.\"\n\n\"Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,\" replied the ghost of Agamemnon, \"you\nare indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare\nexcellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as\nPenelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue\nshall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall\nbe welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope.\nHow far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus\nwho killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men,\nfor she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.\"\n\nThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the\nbowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of\nthe town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes,\nwhich he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with\na lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked for him\nslept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel\nwoman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses\ngot there, he said to his son and to the other two: \n\n\"Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.\nMeanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or fail to\nrecognize me after so long an absence.\" \n\nHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius,\nwho went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the vineyard\nto make trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard,\nhe did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen,\nfor they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard,\nat the place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his\nfather alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched\nand very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to\nsave him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he\nhad a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone.\nWhen Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood\nstill under a tall pear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether\nto embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having come home,\nor whether he should first question him and see what he would say.\nIn the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in this mind\nhe went up to his father, who was bending down and digging about a\nplant. \n\n\"I see, sir,\" said Ulysses, \"that you are an excellent gardener- what\npains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single plant, not\na fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace\nof your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended\nif I say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself.\nYou are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because\nyou are idle that your master takes such poor care of you, indeed\nyour face and figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim\nyou of noble birth. I should have said that you were one of those\nwho should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have\na right to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you,\nand in whose garden are you working? Tell me also about another matter.\nIs this place that I have come to really Ithaca? I met a man just\nnow who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience\nto hear my story out when I was asking him about an old friend of\nmine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the\nhouse of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my\nhouse once when I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger\ncome to me whom I liked better. He said that his family came from\nIthaca and that his father was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received\nhim hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house,\nand when he went away I gave him all customary presents. I gave him\nseven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with flowers\nchased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces\nof tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve\nrugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this\nI added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts, and I\nlet him take his choice.\" \n\nHis father shed tears and answered, \"Sir, you have indeed come to\nthe country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of\nwicked people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose.\nIf you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would\nhave entertained you hospitably and would have required your presents\namply when you left him- as would have been only right considering\nwhat you have already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how\nmany years is it since you entertained this guest- my unhappy son,\nas ever was? Alas! He has perished far from his own country; the fishes\nof the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and\nwild beasts of some continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father,\nwho were his parents, could throw our arms about him and wrap him\nin his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope\nbewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed, and close his\neyes according to the offices due to the departed. But now, tell me\ntruly for I want to know. Who and whence are you- tell me of your\ntown and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you and\nyour men to Ithaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man's ship,\nand those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you?\"\n\n\"I will tell you everything,\" answered Ulysses, \"quite truly. I come\nfrom Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas,\nwho is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove\nme off my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried\nhere against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off\nthe open country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since\nUlysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for\nhim when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both\nhe and I rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope\nthat we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents.\"\n\nA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled\nboth hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his\ngrey head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was\ntouched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then\nhe sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying,\n\"I am he, father, about whom you are asking- I have returned after\nhaving been away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation-\nwe have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing\nthe suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes.\"\n\n\"If you really are my son Ulysses,\" replied Laertes, \"and have come\nback again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity\nas shall convince me.\" \n\n\"First observe this scar,\" answered Ulysses, \"which I got from a boar's\ntusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus. You and my mother had\nsent me to Autolycus, my mother's father, to receive the presents\nwhich when he was over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore\nI will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me,\nand I asked you all about them as I followed you round the garden.\nWe went over them all, and you told me their names and what they all\nwere. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty\nfig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there\nwas corn planted between each row, and they yield grapes of every\nkind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavy upon them.\"\n\nLaertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which\nhis son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had\nto support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon\nas he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, \"O\nfather Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the\nsuitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless,\nI am much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up\nhere directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout\nthe cities of the Cephallenians.\" \n\nUlysses answered, \"Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that,\nbut let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told\nTelemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner\nready as soon as possible.\" \n\nThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they\ngot there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd\ncutting up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman\ntook Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She\nput him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a\nmore imposing presence, making him taller and stouter than before.\nWhen he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like\nan immortal, and said to him, \"My dear father, some one of the gods\nhas been making you much taller and better-looking.\" \n\nLaertes answered, \"Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that\nI were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took\nNericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what\nI then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,\nI should have been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors.\nI should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced\nto see it.\" \n\nThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their\nwork and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his\nproper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by\nand by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their\nmother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was growing\nold, had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were certain\nit was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses scolded\nthem good-naturedly and said, \"Sit down to your dinner, old man, and\nnever mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for\nsome time and have been waiting for you.\" \n\nThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. \"Sir,\"\nsaid he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, \"we\nhave long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to\nus after we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the\ngods prosper you. But tell me, does Penelope already know of your\nreturn, or shall we send some one to tell her?\" \n\n\"Old man,\" answered Ulysses, \"she knows already, so you need not trouble\nabout that.\" On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered\nround Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other;\nthen they took their seats in due order near Dolius their father.\n\nWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went\nround the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen\nthe suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered\nfrom every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.\nThey took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies\nof those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for\nthe fishermen to take each of them to his own place. They then met\nangrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got together\nEupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death\nof his son Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses,\nso he said, weeping bitterly, \"My friend, this man has done the Achaeans\ngreat wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet,\nand he has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he\nhas been killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let\nus be up and doing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where\nthe Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards.\nIt will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder\nof our sons and brothers. For my own part I should have no mote pleasure\nin life, but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after\nthem, before they can cross over to the mainland.\" \n\nHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard\nPhemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses.\nEvery one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle\nof the assembly, and Medon said, \"Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses\ndid not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an\nimmortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god\nappeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously\nabout the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick\non one another.\" \n\nOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor,\nrose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past\nand future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying,\n\n\"Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out\nas they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when\nwe bade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong\nin the wantonness of their hearts- wasting the substance and dishonouring\nthe wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however,\nlet it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against Ulysses,\nor you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your own heads.\"\n\nThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and\nat once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for\nthe speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;\nthey therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed\nthemselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes\nled them on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the\nmurder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to return, but was\nhimself to perish in his attempt. \n\nThen Minerva said to Jove, \"Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,\nanswer me this question- What do you propose to do? Will you set them\nfighting still further, or will you make peace between them?\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by\nyour own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon\nthe suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think\nwill be most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged,\nlet them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue\nto rule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre\nof their sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as heretofore,\nand let peace and plenty reign.\" \n\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she\ndarted from off the topmost summits of Olympus. \n\nNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by\nsaying, \"Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close\nup to us.\" So one of Dolius's sons went as he was bid. Standing on\nthe threshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses,\n\"Here they are, let us put on our armour at once.\" \n\nThey put on their armour as fast as they could- that is to say Ulysses,\nhis three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius\ndid the same- warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When\nthey had all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied\nforth, Ulysses leading the way. \n\nThen Jove's daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form\nand voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to\nhis son Telemachus, \"Telemachus, now that are about to fight in an\nengagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not to disgrace\nyour ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and courage all\nthe world over.\" \n\n\"You say truly, my dear father,\" answered Telemachus, \"and you shall\nsee, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.\"\n\nLaertes was delighted when he heard this. \"Good heavens, he exclaimed,\n\"what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson\nare vying with one another in the matter of valour.\" \n\nOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, \"Son of Arceisius-\nbest friend I have in the world- pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and\nto Jove her father; then poise your spear and hurl it.\" \n\nAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed\nto her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes' helmet,\nand the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not,\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\nMeantime Ulysses and his son fell the front line of the foe and smote\nthem with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed\nevery one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,\nonly Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. \"Men\nof Ithaca,\" she cried, cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter\nat once without further bloodshed.\" \n\nOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their\narms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound\nof the goddess's voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives.\nBut Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped\ndown like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt\nof fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses,\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will\nbe angry with you.\" \n\nThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed\nthe form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace\nbetween the two contending parties. \n\nTHE END\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "eclogue": "The Eclogues\nBy Virgil\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE I\n\nMELIBOEUS, TITYRUS \n\nMeliboeus. \nYou, Tityrus, 'neath a broad beech-canopy \nReclining, on the slender oat rehearse \nYour silvan ditties: I from my sweet fields, \nAnd home's familiar bounds, even now depart. \nExiled from home am I; while, Tityrus, you \nSit careless in the shade, and, at your call, \n\"Fair Amaryllis\" bid the woods resound. \n\nTityrus. \nO Meliboeus, 'twas a god vouchsafed \nThis ease to us, for him a god will I \nDeem ever, and from my folds a tender lamb \nOft with its life-blood shall his altar stain. \nHis gift it is that, as your eyes may see, \nMy kine may roam at large, and I myself \nPlay on my shepherd's pipe what songs I will. \n\nMeliboeus. \nI grudge you not the boon, but marvel more, \nSuch wide confusion fills the country-side. \nSee, sick at heart I drive my she-goats on, \nAnd this one, O my Tityrus, scarce can lead: \nFor 'mid the hazel-thicket here but now \nShe dropped her new-yeaned twins on the bare flint, \nHope of the flock- an ill, I mind me well, \nWhich many a time, but for my blinded sense, \nThe thunder-stricken oak foretold, oft too \nFrom hollow trunk the raven's ominous cry. \nBut who this god of yours? Come, Tityrus, tell. \n\nTityrus. \nThe city, Meliboeus, they call Rome, \nI, simpleton, deemed like this town of ours, \nWhereto we shepherds oft are wont to drive \nThe younglings of the flock: so too I knew \nWhelps to resemble dogs, and kids their dams, \nComparing small with great; but this as far \nAbove all other cities rears her head \nAs cypress above pliant osier towers. \n\nMeliboeus. \nAnd what so potent cause took you to Rome? \n\nTityrus. \nFreedom, which, though belated, cast at length \nHer eyes upon the sluggard, when my beard \n'Gan whiter fall beneath the barber's blade- \nCast eyes, I say, and, though long tarrying, came, \nNow when, from Galatea's yoke released, \nI serve but Amaryllis: for I will own, \nWhile Galatea reigned over me, I had \nNo hope of freedom, and no thought to save. \nThough many a victim from my folds went forth, \nOr rich cheese pressed for the unthankful town, \nNever with laden hands returned I home. \n\nMeliboeus. \nI used to wonder, Amaryllis, why \nYou cried to heaven so sadly, and for whom \nYou left the apples hanging on the trees; \n'Twas Tityrus was away. Why, Tityrus, \nThe very pines, the very water-springs, \nThe very vineyards, cried aloud for you. \n\nTityrus. \nWhat could I do? how else from bonds be freed, \nOr otherwhere find gods so nigh to aid? \nThere, Meliboeus, I saw that youth to whom \nYearly for twice six days my altars smoke. \nThere instant answer gave he to my suit, \n\"Feed, as before, your kine, boys, rear your bulls.\" \n\nMeliboeus. \nSo in old age, you happy man, your fields \nWill still be yours, and ample for your need! \nThough, with bare stones o'erspread, the pastures all \nBe choked with rushy mire, your ewes with young \nBy no strange fodder will be tried, nor hurt \nThrough taint contagious of a neighbouring flock. \nHappy old man, who 'mid familiar streams \nAnd hallowed springs, will court the cooling shade! \nHere, as of old, your neighbour's bordering hedge, \nThat feasts with willow-flower the Hybla bees, \nShall oft with gentle murmur lull to sleep, \nWhile the leaf-dresser beneath some tall rock \nUplifts his song, nor cease their cooings hoarse \nThe wood-pigeons that are your heart's delight, \nNor doves their moaning in the elm-tree top. \n\nTityrus. \nSooner shall light stags, therefore, feed in air, \nThe seas their fish leave naked on the strand, \nGermans and Parthians shift their natural bounds, \nAnd these the Arar, those the Tigris drink, \nThan from my heart his face and memory fade. \n\nMeliboeus. \nBut we far hence, to burning Libya some, \nSome to the Scythian steppes, or thy swift flood, \nCretan Oaxes, now must wend our way, \nOr Britain, from the whole world sundered far. \nAh! shall I ever in aftertime behold \nMy native bounds- see many a harvest hence \nWith ravished eyes the lowly turf-roofed cot \nWhere I was king? These fallows, trimmed so fair, \nSome brutal soldier will possess these fields \nAn alien master. Ah! to what a pass \nHas civil discord brought our hapless folk! \nFor such as these, then, were our furrows sown! \nNow, Meliboeus, graft your pears, now set \nYour vines in order! Go, once happy flock, \nMy she-goats, go. Never again shall I, \nStretched in green cave, behold you from afar \nHang from the bushy rock; my songs are sung; \nNever again will you, with me to tend, \nOn clover-flower, or bitter willows, browse. \n\nTityrus. \nYet here, this night, you might repose with me, \nOn green leaves pillowed: apples ripe have I, \nSoft chestnuts, and of curdled milk enow. \nAnd, see, the farm-roof chimneys smoke afar, \nAnd from the hills the shadows lengthening fall! \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE II\n\nALEXIS \n\nThe shepherd Corydon with love was fired \nFor fair Alexis, his own master's joy: \nNo room for hope had he, yet, none the less, \nThe thick-leaved shadowy-soaring beech-tree grove \nStill would he haunt, and there alone, as thus, \nTo woods and hills pour forth his artless strains. \n\"Cruel Alexis, heed you naught my songs? \nHave you no pity? you'll drive me to my death. \nNow even the cattle court the cooling shade \nAnd the green lizard hides him in the thorn: \nNow for tired mowers, with the fierce heat spent, \nPounds Thestilis her mess of savoury herbs, \nWild thyme and garlic. I, with none beside, \nSave hoarse cicalas shrilling through the brake, \nStill track your footprints 'neath the broiling sun. \nBetter have borne the petulant proud disdain \nOf Amaryllis, or Menalcas wooed, \nAlbeit he was so dark, and you so fair! \nTrust not too much to colour, beauteous boy; \nWhite privets fall, dark hyacinths are culled. \nYou scorn me, Alexis, who or what I am \nCare not to ask- how rich in flocks, or how \nIn snow-white milk abounding: yet for me \nRoam on Sicilian hills a thousand lambs; \nSummer or winter, still my milk-pails brim. \nI sing as erst Amphion of Circe sang, \nWhat time he went to call his cattle home \nOn Attic Aracynthus. Nor am I \nSo ill to look on: lately on the beach \nI saw myself, when winds had stilled the sea, \nAnd, if that mirror lie not, would not fear \nDaphnis to challenge, though yourself were judge. \nAh! were you but content with me to dwell. \nSome lowly cot in the rough fields our home, \nShoot down the stags, or with green osier-wand \nRound up the straggling flock! There you with me \nIn silvan strains will learn to rival Pan. \nPan first with wax taught reed with reed to join; \nFor sheep alike and shepherd Pan hath care. \nNor with the reed's edge fear you to make rough \nYour dainty lip; such arts as these to learn \nWhat did Amyntas do?- what did he not? \nA pipe have I, of hemlock-stalks compact \nIn lessening lengths, Damoetas' dying-gift: \n'Mine once,' quoth he, 'now yours, as heir to own.' \nFoolish Amyntas heard and envied me. \nAy, and two fawns, I risked my neck to find \nIn a steep glen, with coats white-dappled still, \nFrom a sheep's udders suckled twice a day- \nThese still I keep for you; which Thestilis \nImplores me oft to let her lead away; \nAnd she shall have them, since my gifts you spurn. \nCome hither, beauteous boy; for you the Nymphs \nBring baskets, see, with lilies brimmed; for you, \nPlucking pale violets and poppy-heads, \nNow the fair Naiad, of narcissus flower \nAnd fragrant fennel, doth one posy twine- \nWith cassia then, and other scented herbs, \nBlends them, and sets the tender hyacinth off \nWith yellow marigold. I too will pick \nQuinces all silvered-o'er with hoary down, \nChestnuts, which Amaryllis wont to love, \nAnd waxen plums withal: this fruit no less \nShall have its meed of honour; and I will pluck \nYou too, ye laurels, and you, ye myrtles, near, \nFor so your sweets ye mingle. Corydon, \nYou are a boor, nor heeds a whit your gifts \nAlexis; no, nor would Iollas yield, \nShould gifts decide the day. Alack! alack! \nWhat misery have I brought upon my head!- \nLoosed on the flowers Siroces to my bane, \nAnd the wild boar upon my crystal springs! \nWhom do you fly, infatuate? gods ere now, \nAnd Dardan Paris, have made the woods their home. \nLet Pallas keep the towers her hand hath built, \nUs before all things let the woods delight. \nThe grim-eyed lioness pursues the wolf, \nThe wolf the she-goat, the she-goat herself \nIn wanton sport the flowering cytisus, \nAnd Corydon Alexis, each led on \nBy their own longing. See, the ox comes home \nWith plough up-tilted, and the shadows grow \nTo twice their length with the departing sun, \nYet me love burns, for who can limit love? \nAh! Corydon, Corydon, what hath crazed your wit? \nYour vine half-pruned hangs on the leafy elm; \nWhy haste you not to weave what need requires \nOf pliant rush or osier? Scorned by this, \nElsewhere some new Alexis you will find.\" \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE III\n\nMENALCAS, DAMOETAS, PALAEMON \n\nMenalcas. \nWho owns the flock, Damoetas? Meliboeus? \n\nDamoetas. \nNay, they are Aegon's sheep, of late by him \nCommitted to my care. \n\nMenalcas. \nO every way \nUnhappy sheep, unhappy flock! while he \nStill courts Neaera, fearing lest her choice \nShould fall on me, this hireling shepherd here \nWrings hourly twice their udders, from the flock \nFilching the life-juice, from the lambs their milk. \n\nDamoetas. \nHold! not so ready with your jeers at men! \nWe know who once, and in what shrine with you- \nThe he-goats looked aside- the light nymphs laughed- \n\nMenalcas. \nAy, then, I warrant, when they saw me slash \nMicon's young vines and trees with spiteful hook. \n\nDamoetas. \nOr here by these old beeches, when you broke \nThe bow and arrows of Damon; for you chafed \nWhen first you saw them given to the boy, \nCross-grained Menalcas, ay, and had you not \nDone him some mischief, would have chafed to death. \n\nMenalcas. \nWith thieves so daring, what can masters do? \nDid I not see you, rogue, in ambush lie \nFor Damon's goat, while loud Lycisca barked? \nAnd when I cried, \"Where is he off to now? \nGather your flock together, Tityrus,\" \nYou hid behind the sedges. \n\nDamoetas. \nWell, was he \nWhom I had conquered still to keep the goat. \nWhich in the piping-match my pipe had won! \nYou may not know it, but the goat was mine. \n\nMenalcas. \nYou out-pipe him? when had you ever pipe \nWax-welded? in the cross-ways used you not \nOn grating straw some miserable tune \nTo mangle? \n\nDamoetas. \nWell, then, shall we try our skill \nEach against each in turn? Lest you be loth, \nI pledge this heifer; every day she comes \nTwice to the milking-pail, and feeds withal \nTwo young ones at her udder: say you now \nWhat you will stake upon the match with me. \n\nMenalcas. \nNaught from the flock I'll venture, for at home \nI have a father and a step-dame harsh, \nAnd twice a day both reckon up the flock, \nAnd one withal the kids. But I will stake, \nSeeing you are so mad, what you yourself \nWill own more priceless far- two beechen cups \nBy the divine art of Alcimedon \nWrought and embossed, whereon a limber vine, \nWreathed round them by the graver's facile tool, \nTwines over clustering ivy-berries pale. \nTwo figures, one Conon, in the midst he set, \nAnd one- how call you him, who with his wand \nMarked out for all men the whole round of heaven, \nThat they who reap, or stoop behind the plough, \nMight know their several seasons? Nor as yet \nHave I set lip to them, but lay them by. \n\nDamoetas. \nFor me too wrought the same Alcimedon \nA pair of cups, and round the handles wreathed \nPliant acanthus, Orpheus in the midst, \nThe forests following in his wake; nor yet \nHave I set lip to them, but lay them by. \nMatched with a heifer, who would prate of cups? \n\nMenalcas. \nYou shall not balk me now; where'er you bid, \nI shall be with you; only let us have \nFor auditor- or see, to serve our turn, \nYonder Palaemon comes! In singing-bouts \nI'll see you play the challenger no more. \n\nDamoetas. \nOut then with what you have; I shall not shrink, \nNor budge for any man: only do you, \nNeighbour Palaemon, with your whole heart's skill- \nFor it is no slight matter-play your part. \n\nPalaemon. \nSay on then, since on the greensward we sit, \nAnd now is burgeoning both field and tree; \nNow is the forest green, and now the year \nAt fairest. Do you first, Damoetas, sing, \nThen you, Menalcas, in alternate strain: \nAlternate strains are to the Muses dear. \n\nDamoetas. \n\"From Jove the Muse began; Jove filleth all, \nMakes the earth fruitful, for my songs hath care.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"Me Phoebus loves; for Phoebus his own gifts, \nBays and sweet-blushing hyacinths, I keep.\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"Gay Galatea throws an apple at me, \nThen hies to the willows, hoping to be seen.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"My dear Amyntas comes unasked to me; \nNot Delia to my dogs is better known.\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"Gifts for my love I've found; mine eyes have marked \nWhere the wood-pigeons build their airy nests.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"Ten golden apples have I sent my boy, \nAll that I could, to-morrow as many more.\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"What words to me, and uttered O how oft, \nHath Galatea spoke! waft some of them, \nYe winds, I pray you, for the gods to hear.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"It profiteth me naught, Amyntas mine, \nThat in your very heart you spurn me not, \nIf, while you hunt the boar, I guard the nets.\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"Prithee, Iollas, for my birthday guest \nSend me your Phyllis; when for the young crops \nI slay my heifer, you yourself shall come.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"I am all hers; she wept to see me go, \nAnd, lingering on the word, 'farewell' she said, \n'My beautiful Iollas, fare you well.'\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"Fell as the wolf is to the folded flock, \nRain to ripe corn, Sirocco to the trees, \nThe wrath of Amaryllis is to me.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"As moisture to the corn, to ewes with young \nLithe willow, as arbute to the yeanling kids, \nSo sweet Amyntas, and none else, to me.\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"My Muse, although she be but country-bred, \nIs loved by Pollio: O Pierian Maids, \nPray you, a heifer for your reader feed!\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"Pollio himself too doth new verses make: \nFeed ye a bull now ripe to butt with horn, \nAnd scatter with his hooves the flying sand.\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"Who loves thee, Pollio, may he thither come \nWhere thee he joys beholding; ay, for him \nLet honey flow, the thorn-bush spices bear.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"Who hates not Bavius, let him also love \nThy songs, O Maevius, ay, and therewithal \nYoke foxes to his car, and he-goats milk.\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"You, picking flowers and strawberries that grow \nSo near the ground, fly hence, boys, get you gone! \nThere's a cold adder lurking in the grass.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"Forbear, my sheep, to tread too near the brink; \nYon bank is ill to trust to; even now \nThe ram himself, see, dries his dripping fleece!\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"Back with the she-goats, Tityrus, grazing there \nSo near the river! I, when time shall serve, \nWill take them all, and wash them in the pool.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"Boys, get your sheep together; if the heat, \nAs late it did, forestall us with the milk, \nVainly the dried-up udders shall we wring.\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"How lean my bull amid the fattening vetch! \nAlack! alack! for herdsman and for herd! \nIt is the self-same love that wastes us both.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"These truly- nor is even love the cause- \nScarce have the flesh to keep their bones together \nSome evil eye my lambkins hath bewitched.\" \n\nDamoetas. \n\"Say in what clime- and you shall be withal \nMy great Apollo- the whole breadth of heaven \nOpens no wider than three ells to view.\" \n\nMenalcas. \n\"Say in what country grow such flowers as bear \nThe names of kings upon their petals writ, \nAnd you shall have fair Phyllis for your own.\" \n\nPalaemon. \nNot mine betwixt such rivals to decide: \nYou well deserve the heifer, so does he, \nWith all who either fear the sweets of love, \nOr taste its bitterness. Now, boys, shut off \nThe sluices, for the fields have drunk their fill. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE IV\n\nPOLLIO \n\nMuses of Sicily, essay we now \nA somewhat loftier task! Not all men love \nCoppice or lowly tamarisk: sing we woods, \nWoods worthy of a Consul let them be. \nNow the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung \nHas come and gone, and the majestic roll \nOf circling centuries begins anew: \nJustice returns, returns old Saturn's reign, \nWith a new breed of men sent down from heaven. \nOnly do thou, at the boy's birth in whom \nThe iron shall cease, the golden race arise, \nBefriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own \nApollo reigns. And in thy consulate, \nThis glorious age, O Pollio, shall begin, \nAnd the months enter on their mighty march. \nUnder thy guidance, whatso tracks remain \nOf our old wickedness, once done away, \nShall free the earth from never-ceasing fear. \nHe shall receive the life of gods, and see \nHeroes with gods commingling, and himself \nBe seen of them, and with his father's worth \nReign o'er a world at peace. For thee, O boy, \nFirst shall the earth, untilled, pour freely forth \nHer childish gifts, the gadding ivy-spray \nWith foxglove and Egyptian bean-flower mixed, \nAnd laughing-eyed acanthus. Of themselves, \nUntended, will the she-goats then bring home \nTheir udders swollen with milk, while flocks afield \nShall of the monstrous lion have no fear. \nThy very cradle shall pour forth for thee \nCaressing flowers. The serpent too shall die, \nDie shall the treacherous poison-plant, and far \nAnd wide Assyrian spices spring. But soon \nAs thou hast skill to read of heroes' fame, \nAnd of thy father's deeds, and inly learn \nWhat virtue is, the plain by slow degrees \nWith waving corn-crops shall to golden grow, \nFrom the wild briar shall hang the blushing grape, \nAnd stubborn oaks sweat honey-dew. Nathless \nYet shall there lurk within of ancient wrong \nSome traces, bidding tempt the deep with ships, \nGird towns with walls, with furrows cleave the earth. \nTherewith a second Tiphys shall there be, \nHer hero-freight a second Argo bear; \nNew wars too shall arise, and once again \nSome great Achilles to some Troy be sent. \nThen, when the mellowing years have made thee man, \nNo more shall mariner sail, nor pine-tree bark \nPly traffic on the sea, but every land \nShall all things bear alike: the glebe no more \nShall feel the harrow's grip, nor vine the hook; \nThe sturdy ploughman shall loose yoke from steer, \nNor wool with varying colours learn to lie; \nBut in the meadows shall the ram himself, \nNow with soft flush of purple, now with tint \nOf yellow saffron, teach his fleece to shine. \nWhile clothed in natural scarlet graze the lambs. \n\"Such still, such ages weave ye, as ye run,\" \nSang to their spindles the consenting Fates \nBy Destiny's unalterable decree. \nAssume thy greatness, for the time draws nigh, \nDear child of gods, great progeny of Jove! \nSee how it totters- the world's orbed might, \nEarth, and wide ocean, and the vault profound, \nAll, see, enraptured of the coming time! \nAh! might such length of days to me be given, \nAnd breath suffice me to rehearse thy deeds, \nNor Thracian Orpheus should out-sing me then, \nNor Linus, though his mother this, and that \nHis sire should aid- Orpheus Calliope, \nAnd Linus fair Apollo. Nay, though Pan, \nWith Arcady for judge, my claim contest, \nWith Arcady for judge great Pan himself \nShould own him foiled, and from the field retire. \nBegin to greet thy mother with a smile, \nO baby-boy! ten months of weariness \nFor thee she bore: O baby-boy, begin! \nFor him, on whom his parents have not smiled, \nGods deem not worthy of their board or bed. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE V\n\nMENALCAS, MOPSUS \n\nMenalcas. \nWhy, Mopsus, being both together met, \nYou skilled to breathe upon the slender reeds, \nI to sing ditties, do we not sit down \nHere where the elm-trees and the hazels blend? \n\nMopsus. \nYou are the elder, 'tis for me to bide \nYour choice, Menalcas, whether now we seek \nYon shade that quivers to the changeful breeze, \nOr the cave's shelter. Look you how the cave \nIs with the wild vine's clusters over-laced! \n\nMenalcas. \nNone but Amyntas on these hills of ours \nCan vie with you. \n\nMopsus. \nWhat if he also strive \nTo out-sing Phoebus? \n\nMenalcas. \nDo you first begin, \nGood Mopsus, whether minded to sing aught \nOf Phyllis and her loves, or Alcon's praise, \nOr to fling taunts at Codrus. Come, begin, \nWhile Tityrus watches o'er the grazing kids. \n\nMopsus. \nNay, then, I will essay what late I carved \nOn a green beech-tree's rind, playing by turns, \nAnd marking down the notes; then afterward \nBid you Amyntas match them if he can. \n\nMenalcas. \nAs limber willow to pale olive yields, \nAs lowly Celtic nard to rose-buds bright, \nSo, to my mind, Amyntas yields to you. \nBut hold awhile, for to the cave we come. \n\nMopsus. \n\"For Daphnis cruelly slain wept all the Nymphs- \nYe hazels, bear them witness, and ye streams- \nWhen she, his mother, clasping in her arms \nThe hapless body of the son she bare, \nTo gods and stars unpitying, poured her plaint. \nThen, Daphnis, to the cooling streams were none \nThat drove the pastured oxen, then no beast \nDrank of the river, or would the grass-blade touch. \nNay, the wild rocks and woods then voiced the roar \nOf Afric lions mourning for thy death. \nDaphnis, 'twas thou bad'st yoke to Bacchus' car \nArmenian tigresses, lead on the pomp \nOf revellers, and with tender foliage wreathe \nThe bending spear-wands. As to trees the vine \nIs crown of glory, as to vines the grape, \nBulls to the herd, to fruitful fields the corn, \nSo the one glory of thine own art thou. \nWhen the Fates took thee hence, then Pales' self, \nAnd even Apollo, left the country lone. \nWhere the plump barley-grain so oft we sowed, \nThere but wild oats and barren darnel spring; \nFor tender violet and narcissus bright \nThistle and prickly thorn uprear their heads. \nNow, O ye shepherds, strew the ground with leaves, \nAnd o'er the fountains draw a shady veil- \nSo Daphnis to his memory bids be done- \nAnd rear a tomb, and write thereon this verse: \n'I, Daphnis in the woods, from hence in fame \nAm to the stars exalted, guardian once \nOf a fair flock, myself more fair than they.'\" \n\nMenalcas. \nSo is thy song to me, poet divine, \nAs slumber on the grass to weary limbs, \nOr to slake thirst from some sweet-bubbling rill \nIn summer's heat. Nor on the reeds alone, \nBut with thy voice art thou, thrice happy boy, \nRanked with thy master, second but to him. \nYet will I, too, in turn, as best I may, \nSing thee a song, and to the stars uplift \nThy Daphnis- Daphnis to the stars extol, \nFor me too Daphnis loved. \n\nMopsus. \nThan such a boon \nWhat dearer could I deem? the boy himself \nWas worthy to be sung, and many a time \nHath Stimichon to me your singing praised. \n\nMenalcas. \n\"In dazzling sheen with unaccustomed eyes \nDaphnis stands rapt before Olympus' gate, \nAnd sees beneath his feet the clouds and stars. \nWherefore the woods and fields, Pan, shepherd-folk, \nAnd Dryad-maidens, thrill with eager joy; \nNor wolf with treacherous wile assails the flock, \nNor nets the stag: kind Daphnis loveth peace. \nThe unshorn mountains to the stars up-toss \nVoices of gladness; ay, the very rocks, \nThe very thickets, shout and sing, 'A god, \nA god is he, Menalcas \"Be thou kind, \nPropitious to thine own. Lo! altars four, \nTwain to thee, Daphnis, and to Phoebus twain \nFor sacrifice, we build; and I for thee \nTwo beakers yearly of fresh milk afoam, \nAnd of rich olive-oil two bowls, will set; \nAnd of the wine-god's bounty above all, \nIf cold, before the hearth, or in the shade \nAt harvest-time, to glad the festal hour, \nFrom flasks of Ariusian grape will pour \nSweet nectar. Therewithal at my behest \nShall Lyctian Aegon and Damoetas sing, \nAnd Alphesiboeus emulate in dance \nThe dancing Satyrs. This, thy service due, \nShalt thou lack never, both when we pay the Nymphs \nOur yearly vows, and when with lustral rites \nThe fields we hallow. Long as the wild boar \nShall love the mountain-heights, and fish the streams, \nWhile bees on thyme and crickets feed on dew, \nThy name, thy praise, thine honour, shall endure. \nEven as to Bacchus and to Ceres, so \nTo thee the swain his yearly vows shall make; \nAnd thou thereof, like them, shalt quittance claim.\" \n\nMopsus. \nHow, how repay thee for a song so rare? \nFor not the whispering south-wind on its way \nSo much delights me, nor wave-smitten beach, \nNor streams that race adown their bouldered beds. \n\nMenalcas. \nFirst this frail hemlock-stalk to you I give, \nWhich taught me \"Corydon with love was fired \nFor fair Alexis,\" ay, and this beside, \n\"Who owns the flock?- Meliboeus?\" \n\nMopsus. \nBut take you \nThis shepherd's crook, which, howso hard he begged, \nAntigenes, then worthy to be loved, \nPrevailed not to obtain- with brass, you see, \nAnd equal knots, Menalcas, fashioned fair! \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE VI\n\nTO VARUS \n\nFirst my Thalia stooped in sportive mood \nTo Syracusan strains, nor blushed within \nThe woods to house her. When I sought to tell \nOf battles and of kings, the Cynthian god \nPlucked at mine ear and warned me: \"Tityrus, \nBeseems a shepherd-wight to feed fat sheep, \nBut sing a slender song.\" Now, Varus, I- \nFor lack there will not who would laud thy deeds, \nAnd treat of dolorous wars- will rather tune \nTo the slim oaten reed my silvan lay. \nI sing but as vouchsafed me; yet even this \nIf, if but one with ravished eyes should read, \nOf thee, O Varus, shall our tamarisks \nAnd all the woodland ring; nor can there be \nA page more dear to Phoebus, than the page \nWhere, foremost writ, the name of Varus stands. \nSpeed ye, Pierian Maids! Within a cave \nYoung Chromis and Mnasyllos chanced to see \nSilenus sleeping, flushed, as was his wont, \nWith wine of yesterday. Not far aloof, \nSlipped from his head, the garlands lay, and there \nBy its worn handle hung a ponderous cup. \nApproaching- for the old man many a time \nHad balked them both of a long hoped-for song- \nGarlands to fetters turned, they bind him fast. \nThen Aegle, fairest of the Naiad-band, \nAegle came up to the half-frightened boys, \nCame, and, as now with open eyes he lay, \nWith juice of blood-red mulberries smeared him o'er, \nBoth brow and temples. Laughing at their guile, \nAnd crying, \"Why tie the fetters? loose me, boys; \nEnough for you to think you had the power; \nNow list the songs you wish for- songs for you, \nAnother meed for her\" -forthwith began. \nThen might you see the wild things of the wood, \nWith Fauns in sportive frolic beat the time, \nAnd stubborn oaks their branchy summits bow. \nNot Phoebus doth the rude Parnassian crag \nSo ravish, nor Orpheus so entrance the heights \nOf Rhodope or Ismarus: for he sang \nHow through the mighty void the seeds were driven \nOf earth, air, ocean, and of liquid fire, \nHow all that is from these beginnings grew, \nAnd the young world itself took solid shape, \nThen 'gan its crust to harden, and in the deep \nShut Nereus off, and mould the forms of things \nLittle by little; and how the earth amazed \nBeheld the new sun shining, and the showers \nFall, as the clouds soared higher, what time the woods \n'Gan first to rise, and living things to roam \nScattered among the hills that knew them not. \nThen sang he of the stones by Pyrrha cast, \nOf Saturn's reign, and of Prometheus' theft, \nAnd the Caucasian birds, and told withal \nNigh to what fountain by his comrades left \nThe mariners cried on Hylas till the shore \n\"Then Re-echoed \"Hylas, Hylas! soothed \nPasiphae with the love of her white bull- \nHappy if cattle-kind had never been!- \nO ill-starred maid, what frenzy caught thy soul \nThe daughters too of Proetus filled the fields \nWith their feigned lowings, yet no one of them \nOf such unhallowed union e'er was fain \nAs with a beast to mate, though many a time \nOn her smooth forehead she had sought for horns, \nAnd for her neck had feared the galling plough. \nO ill-starred maid! thou roamest now the hills, \nWhile on soft hyacinths he, his snowy side \nReposing, under some dark ilex now \nChews the pale herbage, or some heifer tracks \nAmid the crowding herd. Now close, ye Nymphs, \nYe Nymphs of Dicte, close the forest-glades, \nIf haply there may chance upon mine eyes \nThe white bull's wandering foot-prints: him belike \nFollowing the herd, or by green pasture lured, \nSome kine may guide to the Gortynian stalls. \nThen sings he of the maid so wonder-struck \nWith the apples of the Hesperids, and then \nWith moss-bound, bitter bark rings round the forms \nOf Phaethon's fair sisters, from the ground \nUp-towering into poplars. Next he sings \nOf Gallus wandering by Permessus' stream, \nAnd by a sister of the Muses led \nTo the Aonian mountains, and how all \nThe choir of Phoebus rose to greet him; how \nThe shepherd Linus, singer of songs divine, \nBrow-bound with flowers and bitter parsley, spake: \n\"These reeds the Muses give thee, take them thou, \nErst to the aged bard of Ascra given, \nWherewith in singing he was wont to draw \nTime-rooted ash-trees from the mountain heights. \nWith these the birth of the Grynean grove \nBe voiced by thee, that of no grove beside \nApollo more may boast him.\" Wherefore speak \nOf Scylla, child of Nisus, who, 'tis said, \nHer fair white loins with barking monsters girt \nVexed the Dulichian ships, and, in the deep \nSwift-eddying whirlpool, with her sea-dogs tore \nThe trembling mariners? or how he told \nOf the changed limbs of Tereus- what a feast, \nWhat gifts, to him by Philomel were given; \nHow swift she sought the desert, with what wings \nHovered in anguish o'er her ancient home? \nAll that, of old, Eurotas, happy stream, \nHeard, as Apollo mused upon the lyre, \nAnd bade his laurels learn, Silenus sang; \nTill from Olympus, loth at his approach, \nVesper, advancing, bade the shepherds tell \nTheir tale of sheep, and pen them in the fold. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE VII\n\nMELIBOEUS, CORYDON, THYRSIS \n\nDaphnis beneath a rustling ilex-tree \nHad sat him down; Thyrsis and Corydon \nHad gathered in the flock, Thyrsis the sheep, \nAnd Corydon the she-goats swollen with milk- \nBoth in the flower of age, Arcadians both, \nReady to sing, and in like strain reply. \nHither had strayed, while from the frost I fend \nMy tender myrtles, the he-goat himself, \nLord of the flock; when Daphnis I espy! \nSoon as he saw me, \"Hither haste,\" he cried, \n\"O Meliboeus! goat and kids are safe; \nAnd, if you have an idle hour to spare, \nRest here beneath the shade. Hither the steers \nWill through the meadows, of their own free will, \nUntended come to drink. Here Mincius hath \nWith tender rushes rimmed his verdant banks, \nAnd from yon sacred oak with busy hum \nThe bees are swarming.\" What was I to do? \nNo Phyllis or Alcippe left at home \nHad I, to shelter my new-weaned lambs, \nAnd no slight matter was a singing-bout \n'Twixt Corydon and Thyrsis. Howsoe'er, \nI let my business wait upon their sport. \nSo they began to sing, voice answering voice \nIn strains alternate- for alternate strains \nThe Muses then were minded to recall- \nFirst Corydon, then Thyrsis in reply. \n\nCorydon. \n\"Libethrian Nymphs, who are my heart's delight, \nGrant me, as doth my Codrus, so to sing- \nNext to Apollo he- or if to this \nWe may not all attain, my tuneful pipe \nHere on this sacred pine shall silent hang.\" \n\nThyrsis. \n\"Arcadian shepherds, wreathe with ivy-spray \nYour budding poet, so that Codrus burst \nWith envy: if he praise beyond my due, \nThen bind my brow with foxglove, lest his tongue \nWith evil omen blight the coming bard.\" \n\nCorydon. \n\"This bristling boar's head, Delian Maid, to thee, \nWith branching antlers of a sprightly stag, \nYoung Micon offers: if his luck but hold, \nFull-length in polished marble, ankle-bound \nWith purple buskin, shall thy statue stand.\" \n\nThyrsis. \n\"A bowl of milk, Priapus, and these cakes, \nYearly, it is enough for thee to claim; \nThou art the guardian of a poor man's plot. \nWrought for a while in marble, if the flock \nAt lambing time be filled,stand there in gold.\" \n\nCorydon. \n\"Daughter of Nereus, Galatea mine, \nSweeter than Hybla-thyme, more white than swans, \nFairer than ivy pale, soon as the steers \nShall from their pasture to the stalls repair, \nIf aught for Corydon thou carest, come.\" \n\nThyrsis. \n\"Now may I seem more bitter to your taste \nThan herb Sardinian, rougher than the broom, \nMore worthless than strewn sea-weed, if to-day \nHath not a year out-lasted! Fie for shame! \nGo home, my cattle, from your grazing go!\" \n\nCorydon. \n\"Ye mossy springs, and grass more soft than sleep, \nAnd arbute green with thin shade sheltering you, \nWard off the solstice from my flock, for now \nComes on the burning summer, now the buds \nUpon the limber vine-shoot 'gin to swell.\" \n\nThyrsis. \n\"Here is a hearth, and resinous logs, here fire \nUnstinted, and doors black with ceaseless smoke. \nHere heed we Boreas' icy breath as much \nAs the wolf heeds the number of the flock, \nOr furious rivers their restraining banks.\" \n\nCorydon. \n\"The junipers and prickly chestnuts stand, \nAnd 'neath each tree lie strewn their several fruits, \nNow the whole world is smiling, but if fair \nAlexis from these hill-slopes should away, \nEven the rivers you would ; see run dry.\" \n\nThyrsis. \n\"The field is parched, the grass-blades thirst to death \nIn the faint air; Liber hath grudged the hills \nHis vine's o'er-shadowing: should my Phyllis come, \nGreen will be all the grove, and Jupiter \nDescend in floods of fertilizing rain.\" \n\nCorydon. \n\"The poplar doth Alcides hold most dear, \nThe vine Iacchus, Phoebus his own bays, \nAnd Venus fair the myrtle: therewithal \nPhyllis doth hazels love, and while she loves, \nMyrtle nor bay the hazel shall out-vie.\" \n\nThyrsis. \n\"Ash in the forest is most beautiful, \nPine in the garden, poplar by the stream, \nFir on the mountain-height; but if more oft \nThou'ldst come to me, fair Lycidas, to thee \nBoth forest-ash, and garden-pine should bow.\" \n\nMeliboeus. \nThese I remember, and how Thyrsis strove \nFor victory in vain. From that time forth \nIs Corydon still Corydon with us. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE VIII\n\nTO POLLIO, DAMON, ALPHESIBOEUS \n\nOf Damon and Alphesiboeus now, \nThose shepherd-singers at whose rival strains \nThe heifer wondering forgot to graze, \nThe lynx stood awe-struck, and the flowing streams, \nUnwonted loiterers, stayed their course to hear- \nHow Damon and Alphesiboeus sang \nTheir pastoral ditties, will I tell the tale. \nThou, whether broad Timavus' rocky banks \nThou now art passing, or dost skirt the shore \nOf the Illyrian main,- will ever dawn \nThat day when I thy deeds may celebrate, \nEver that day when through the whole wide world \nI may renown thy verse- that verse alone \nOf Sophoclean buskin worthy found? \nWith thee began, to thee shall end, the strain. \nTake thou these songs that owe their birth to thee, \nAnd deign around thy temples to let creep \nThis ivy-chaplet 'twixt the conquering bays. \nScarce had night's chilly shade forsook the sky \nWhat time to nibbling sheep the dewy grass \nTastes sweetest, when, on his smooth shepherd-staff \nOf olive leaning, Damon thus began. \n\nDamon. \n\"Rise, Lucifer, and, heralding the light, \nBring in the genial day, while I make moan \nFooled by vain passion for a faithless bride, \nFor Nysa, and with this my dying breath \nCall on the gods, though little it bestead- \nThe gods who heard her vows and heeded not. \n\"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays. \nEver hath Maenalus his murmuring groves \nAnd whispering pines, and ever hears the songs \nOf love-lorn shepherds, and of Pan, who first \nBrooked not the tuneful reed should idle lie. \n\"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays. \nNysa to Mopsus given! what may not then \nWe lovers look for? soon shall we see mate \nGriffins with mares, and in the coming age \nShy deer and hounds together come to drink. \n\"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays. \nNow, Mopsus, cut new torches, for they bring \nYour bride along; now, bridegroom, scatter nuts: \nForsaking Oeta mounts the evening star! \n\"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays. \nO worthy of thy mate, while all men else \nThou scornest, and with loathing dost behold \nMy shepherd's pipe, my goats, my shaggy brow, \nAnd untrimmed beard, nor deem'st that any god \nFor mortal doings hath regard or care. \n\"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays. \nOnce with your mother, in our orchard-garth, \nA little maid I saw you- I your guide- \nPlucking the dewy apples. My twelfth year \nI scarce had entered, and could barely reach \nThe brittle boughs. I looked, and I was lost; \nA sudden frenzy swept my wits away. \n\"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays. \nNow know I what Love is: 'mid savage rocks \nTmaros or Rhodope brought forth the boy, \nOr Garamantes in earth's utmost bounds- \nNo kin of ours, nor of our blood begot. \n\"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays. \nFierce Love it was once steeled a mother's heart \nWith her own offspring's blood her hands to imbrue: \nMother, thou too wert cruel; say wert thou \nMore cruel, mother, or more ruthless he? \nRuthless the boy, thou, mother, cruel too. \n\"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays. \nNow let the wolf turn tail and fly the sheep, \nTough oaks bear golden apples, alder-trees \nBloom with narcissus-flower, the tamarisk \nSweat with rich amber, and the screech-owl vie \nIn singing with the swan: let Tityrus \nBe Orpheus, Orpheus in the forest-glade, \nArion 'mid his dolphins on the deep. \n\"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays. \nYea, be the whole earth to mid-ocean turned! \nFarewell, ye woodlands I from the tall peak \nOf yon aerial rock will headlong plunge \nInto the billows: this my latest gift, \nFrom dying lips bequeathed thee, see thou keep. \nCease now, my flute, now cease Maenalian lays.\" \nThus Damon: but do ye, Pierian Maids- \nWe cannot all do all things- tell me how \nAlphesiboeus to his strain replied. \n\nAlphesiboeus. \n\"Bring water, and with soft wool-fillet bind \nThese altars round about, and burn thereon \nRich vervain and male frankincense, that I \nMay strive with magic spells to turn astray \nMy lover's saner senses, whereunto \nThere lacketh nothing save the power of song. \n\"Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home. \nSongs can the very moon draw down from heaven \nCirce with singing changed from human form \nThe comrades of Ulysses, and by song \nIs the cold meadow-snake, asunder burst. \n\"Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home. \nThese triple threads of threefold colour first \nI twine about thee, and three times withal \nAround these altars do thine image bear: \nUneven numbers are the god's delight. \n\"Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home. \nNow, Amaryllis, ply in triple knots \nThe threefold colours; ply them fast, and say \nThis is the chain of Venus that I ply. \n\"Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home. \nAs by the kindling of the self-same fire \nHarder this clay, this wax the softer grows, \nSo by my love may Daphnis; sprinkle meal, \nAnd with bitumen burn the brittle bays. \nMe Daphnis with his cruelty doth burn, \nI to melt cruel Daphnis burn this bay. \n\"Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home. \nAs when some heifer, seeking for her steer \nThrough woodland and deep grove, sinks wearied out \nOn the green sedge beside a stream, love-lorn, \nNor marks the gathering night that calls her home- \nAs pines that heifer, with such love as hers \nMay Daphnis pine, and I not care to heal. \n\"Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home. \nThese relics once, dear pledges of himself, \nThe traitor left me, which, O earth, to thee \nHere on this very threshold I commit- \nPledges that bind him to redeem the debt. \n\"Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home. \nThese herbs of bane to me did Moeris give, \nIn Pontus culled, where baneful herbs abound. \nWith these full oft have I seen Moeris change \nTo a wolf's form, and hide him in the woods, \nOft summon spirits from the tomb's recess, \nAnd to new fields transport the standing corn. \n\"Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home. \nTake ashes, Amaryllis, fetch them forth, \nAnd o'er your head into the running brook \nFling them, nor look behind: with these will \nUpon the heart of Daphnis make essay. \nNothing for gods, nothing for songs cares he. \n\"Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home. \nLook, look I the very embers of themselves \nHave caught the altar with a flickering flame, \nWhile I delay to fetch them: may the sign \nProve lucky! something it must mean, for sure, \nAnd Hylax on the threshold 'gins to bark! \nMay we believe it, or are lovers still \nBy their own fancies fooled? \nGive o'er, my songs, \nDaphnis is coming from the town, give o'er.\" \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE IX\n\nLYCIDAS, MOERIS \n\nLycidas. \nSay whither, Moeris?- Make you for the town, \nOr on what errand bent? \n\nMoeris. O Lycidas, \nWe have lived to see, what never yet we feared, \nAn interloper own our little farm, \nAnd say, \"Be off, you former husbandmen! \nThese fields are mine.\" Now, cowed and out of heart, \nSince Fortune turns the whole world upside down, \nWe are taking him- ill luck go with the same!-' \nThese kids you see. \n\nLycidas. \nBut surely I had heard \nThat where the hills first draw from off the plain, \nAnd the high ridge with gentle slope descends, \nDown to the brook-side and the broken crests \nOf yonder veteran beeches, all the land \nWas by the songs of your Menalcas saved. \n\nMoeris. \nHeard it you had, and so the rumour ran, \nBut 'mid the clash of arms, my Lycidas, \nOur songs avail no more than, as 'tis said, \nDoves of Dodona when an eagle comes. \nNay, had I not, from hollow ilex-bole \nWarned by a raven on the left, cut short \nThe rising feud, nor I, your Moeris here, \nNo, nor Menalcas, were alive to-day. \n\nLycidas. \nAlack! could any of so foul a crime \nBe guilty? Ah! how nearly, thyself, \nReft was the solace that we had in thee, \nMenalcas! Who then of the Nymphs had sung, \nOr who with flowering herbs bestrewn the ground, \nAnd o'er the fountains drawn a leafy veil?- \nWho sung the stave I filched from you that day \nTo Amaryllis wending, our hearts' joy?- \n\"While I am gone, 'tis but a little way, \nFeed, Tityrus, my goats, and, having fed, \nDrive to the drinking-pool, and, as you drive, \nBeware the he-goat; with his horn he butts.\" \n\nMoeris. \nAy, or to Varus that half-finished lay, \n\"Varus, thy name, so still our Mantua live- \nMantua to poor Cremona all too near- \nShall singing swans bear upward to the stars.\" \n\nLycidas. \nSo may your swarms Cyrnean yew-trees shun, \nYour kine with cytisus their udders swell, \nBegin, if aught you have. The Muses made \nMe too a singer; I too have sung; the swains \nCall me a poet, but I believe them not: \nFor naught of mine, or worthy Varius yet \nOr Cinna deem I, but account myself \nA cackling goose among melodious swans. \n\nMoeris. \n'Twas in my thought to do so, Lycidas; \nEven now was I revolving silently \nIf this I could recall- no paltry song: \n\"Come, Galatea, what pleasure is 't to play \nAmid the waves? Here glows the Spring, here earth \nBeside the streams pours forth a thousand flowers; \nHere the white poplar bends above the cave, \nAnd the lithe vine weaves shadowy covert: come, \nLeave the mad waves to beat upon the shore.\" \n\nLycidas. \nWhat of the strain I heard you singing once \nOn a clear night alone? the notes I still \nRemember, could I but recall the words. \n\nMoeris. \n\"Why, Daphnis, upward gazing, do you mark \nThe ancient risings of the Signs? for look \nWhere Dionean Caesar's star comes forth \nIn heaven, to gladden all the fields with corn, \nAnd to the grape upon the sunny slopes \nHer colour bring! Now, the pears; \nSo shall your children's children pluck their fruit. \nTime carries all things, even our wits, away. \nOft, as a boy, I sang the sun to rest, \nBut all those songs are from my memory fled, \nAnd even his voice is failing Moeris now; \nThe wolves eyed Moeris first: but at your wish \nMenalcas will repeat them oft enow. \n\nLycidas. \nYour pleas but linger out my heart's desire: \nNow all the deep is into silence hushed, \nAnd all the murmuring breezes sunk to sleep. \nWe are half-way thither, for Bianor's tomb \nBegins to show: here, Moeris, where the hinds \nAre lopping the thick leafage, let us sing. \nSet down the kids, yet shall we reach the town; \nOr, if we fear the night may gather rain \nEre we arrive, then singing let us go, \nOur way to lighten; and, that we may thus \nGo singing, I will case you of this load. \n\nMoeris. \nCease, boy, and get we to the work in hand: \nWe shall sing better when himself is come. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nECLOGUE X\n\nGALLUS \n\nThis now, the very latest of my toils, \nVouchsafe me, Arethusa! needs must I \nSing a brief song to Gallus- brief, but yet \nSuch as Lycoris' self may fitly read. \nWho would not sing for Gallus? So, when thou \nBeneath Sicanian billows glidest on, \nMay Doris blend no bitter wave with thine, \nBegin! The love of Gallus be our theme, \nAnd the shrewd pangs he suffered, while, hard by, \nThe flat-nosed she-goats browse the tender brush. \nWe sing not to deaf ears; no word of ours \nBut the woods echo it. What groves or lawns \nHeld you, ye Dryad-maidens, when for love- \nLove all unworthy of a loss so dear- \nGallus lay dying? for neither did the slopes \nOf Pindus or Parnassus stay you then, \nNo, nor Aonian Aganippe. Him \nEven the laurels and the tamarisks wept; \nFor him, outstretched beneath a lonely rock, \nWept pine-clad Maenalus, and the flinty crags \nOf cold Lycaeus. The sheep too stood around- \nOf us they feel no shame, poet divine; \nNor of the flock be thou ashamed: even fair \nAdonis by the rivers fed his sheep- \nCame shepherd too, and swine-herd footing slow, \nAnd, from the winter-acorns dripping-wet \nMenalcas. All with one accord exclaim: \n\"From whence this love of thine?\" Apollo came; \n\"Gallus, art mad?\" he cried, \"thy bosom's care \nAnother love is following.\"Therewithal \nSilvanus came, with rural honours crowned; \nThe flowering fennels and tall lilies shook \nBefore him. Yea, and our own eyes beheld \nPan, god of Arcady, with blood-red juice \nOf the elder-berry, and with vermilion, dyed. \n\"Wilt ever make an end?\" quoth he, \"behold \nLove recks not aught of it: his heart no more \nWith tears is sated than with streams the grass, \nBees with the cytisus, or goats with leaves.\" \n\"Yet will ye sing, Arcadians, of my woes \nUpon your mountains,\" sadly he replied- \n\"Arcadians, that alone have skill to sing. \nO then how softly would my ashes rest, \nIf of my love, one day, your flutes should tell! \nAnd would that I, of your own fellowship, \nOr dresser of the ripening grape had been, \nOr guardian of the flock! for surely then, \nLet Phyllis, or Amyntas, or who else, \nBewitch me- what if swart Amyntas be? \nDark is the violet, dark the hyacinth- \nAmong the willows, 'neath the limber vine, \nReclining would my love have lain with me, \nPhyllis plucked garlands, or Amyntas sung. \nHere are cool springs, soft mead and grove, Lycoris; \nHere might our lives with time have worn away. \nBut me mad love of the stern war-god holds \nArmed amid weapons and opposing foes. \nWhilst thou- Ah! might I but believe it not!- \nAlone without me, and from home afar, \nLook'st upon Alpine snows and frozen Rhine. \nAh! may the frost not hurt thee, may the sharp \nAnd jagged ice not wound thy tender feet! \nI will depart, re-tune the songs I framed \nIn verse Chalcidian to the oaten reed \nOf the Sicilian swain. Resolved am I \nIn the woods, rather, with wild beasts to couch, \nAnd bear my doom, and character my love \nUpon the tender tree-trunks: they will grow, \nAnd you, my love, grow with them. And meanwhile \nI with the Nymphs will haunt Mount Maenalus, \nOr hunt the keen wild boar. No frost so cold \nBut I will hem with hounds thy forest-glades, \nParthenius. Even now, methinks, I range \nO'er rocks, through echoing groves, and joy to launch \nCydonian arrows from a Parthian bow.- \nAs if my madness could find healing thus, \nOr that god soften at a mortal's grief! \nNow neither Hamadryads, no, nor songs \nDelight me more: ye woods, away with you! \nNo pangs of ours can change him; not though we \nIn the mid-frost should drink of Hebrus' stream, \nAnd in wet winters face Sithonian snows, \nOr, when the bark of the tall elm-tree bole \nOf drought is dying, should, under Cancer's Sign, \nIn Aethiopian deserts drive our flocks. \nLove conquers all things; yield we too to love!\" \nThese songs, Pierian Maids, shall it suffice \nYour poet to have sung, the while he sat, \nAnd of slim mallow wove a basket fine: \nTo Gallus ye will magnify their worth, \nGallus, for whom my love grows hour by hour, \nAs the green alder shoots in early Spring. \nCome, let us rise: the shade is wont to be \nBaneful to singers; baneful is the shade \nCast by the juniper, crops sicken too \nIn shade. Now homeward, having fed your fill- \nEve's star is rising-go, my she-goats, go. \n\nTHE END\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "georgics": "The Georgics\nBy Virgil\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGEORGIC I\n\nWhat makes the cornfield smile; beneath what star \nMaecenas, it is meet to turn the sod \nOr marry elm with vine; how tend the steer; \nWhat pains for cattle-keeping, or what proof \nOf patient trial serves for thrifty bees;- \nSuch are my themes. \n\nO universal lights \nMost glorious! ye that lead the gliding year \nAlong the sky, Liber and Ceres mild, \nIf by your bounty holpen earth once changed \nChaonian acorn for the plump wheat-ear, \nAnd mingled with the grape, your new-found gift, \nThe draughts of Achelous; and ye Fauns \nTo rustics ever kind, come foot it, Fauns \nAnd Dryad-maids together; your gifts I sing. \nAnd thou, for whose delight the war-horse first \nSprang from earth's womb at thy great trident's stroke, \nNeptune; and haunter of the groves, for whom \nThree hundred snow-white heifers browse the brakes, \nThe fertile brakes of Ceos; and clothed in power, \nThy native forest and Lycean lawns, \nPan, shepherd-god, forsaking, as the love \nOf thine own Maenalus constrains thee, hear \nAnd help, O lord of Tegea! And thou, too, \nMinerva, from whose hand the olive sprung; \nAnd boy-discoverer of the curved plough; \nAnd, bearing a young cypress root-uptorn, \nSilvanus, and Gods all and Goddesses, \nWho make the fields your care, both ye who nurse \nThe tender unsown increase, and from heaven \nShed on man's sowing the riches of your rain: \nAnd thou, even thou, of whom we know not yet \nWhat mansion of the skies shall hold thee soon, \nWhether to watch o'er cities be thy will, \nGreat Caesar, and to take the earth in charge, \nThat so the mighty world may welcome thee \nLord of her increase, master of her times, \nBinding thy mother's myrtle round thy brow, \nOr as the boundless ocean's God thou come, \nSole dread of seamen, till far Thule bow \nBefore thee, and Tethys win thee to her son \nWith all her waves for dower; or as a star \nLend thy fresh beams our lagging months to cheer, \nWhere 'twixt the Maid and those pursuing Claws \nA space is opening; see! red Scorpio's self \nHis arms draws in, yea, and hath left thee more \nThan thy full meed of heaven: be what thou wilt- \nFor neither Tartarus hopes to call thee king, \nNor may so dire a lust of sovereignty \nE'er light upon thee, howso Greece admire \nElysium's fields, and Proserpine not heed \nHer mother's voice entreating to return- \nVouchsafe a prosperous voyage, and smile on this \nMy bold endeavour, and pitying, even as I, \nThese poor way-wildered swains, at once begin, \nGrow timely used unto the voice of prayer. \nIn early spring-tide, when the icy drip \nMelts from the mountains hoar, and Zephyr's breath \nUnbinds the crumbling clod, even then 'tis time; \nPress deep your plough behind the groaning ox, \nAnd teach the furrow-burnished share to shine. \nThat land the craving farmer's prayer fulfils, \nWhich twice the sunshine, twice the frost has felt; \nAy, that's the land whose boundless harvest-crops \nBurst, see! the barns. \n\nBut ere our metal cleave \nAn unknown surface, heed we to forelearn \nThe winds and varying temper of the sky, \nThe lineal tilth and habits of the spot, \nWhat every region yields, and what denies. \nHere blithelier springs the corn, and here the grape, \nThere earth is green with tender growth of trees \nAnd grass unbidden. See how from Tmolus comes \nThe saffron's fragrance, ivory from Ind, \nFrom Saba's weakling sons their frankincense, \nIron from the naked Chalybs, castor rank \nFrom Pontus, from Epirus the prize-palms \nO' the mares of Elis. \n\nSuch the eternal bond \nAnd such the laws by Nature's hand imposed \nOn clime and clime, e'er since the primal dawn \nWhen old Deucalion on the unpeopled earth \nCast stones, whence men, a flinty race, were reared. \nUp then! if fat the soil, let sturdy bulls \nUpturn it from the year's first opening months, \nAnd let the clods lie bare till baked to dust \nBy the ripe suns of summer; but if the earth \nLess fruitful just ere Arcturus rise \nWith shallower trench uptilt it- 'twill suffice; \nThere, lest weeds choke the crop's luxuriance, here, \nLest the scant moisture fail the barren sand. \n\nThen thou shalt suffer in alternate years \nThe new-reaped fields to rest, and on the plain \nA crust of sloth to harden; or, when stars \nAre changed in heaven, there sow the golden grain \nWhere erst, luxuriant with its quivering pod, \nPulse, or the slender vetch-crop, thou hast cleared, \nAnd lupin sour, whose brittle stalks arise, \nA hurtling forest. For the plain is parched \nBy flax-crop, parched by oats, by poppies parched \nIn Lethe-slumber drenched. Nathless by change \nThe travailing earth is lightened, but stint not \nWith refuse rich to soak the thirsty soil, \nAnd shower foul ashes o'er the exhausted fields. \nThus by rotation like repose is gained, \nNor earth meanwhile uneared and thankless left. \nOft, too, 'twill boot to fire the naked fields, \nAnd the light stubble burn with crackling flames; \nWhether that earth therefrom some hidden strength \nAnd fattening food derives, or that the fire \nBakes every blemish out, and sweats away \nEach useless humour, or that the heat unlocks \nNew passages and secret pores, whereby \nTheir life-juice to the tender blades may win; \nOr that it hardens more and helps to bind \nThe gaping veins, lest penetrating showers, \nOr fierce sun's ravening might, or searching blast \nOf the keen north should sear them. Well, I wot, \nHe serves the fields who with his harrow breaks \nThe sluggish clods, and hurdles osier-twined \nHales o'er them; from the far Olympian height \nHim golden Ceres not in vain regards; \nAnd he, who having ploughed the fallow plain \nAnd heaved its furrowy ridges, turns once more \nCross-wise his shattering share, with stroke on stroke \nThe earth assails, and makes the field his thrall. \nPray for wet summers and for winters fine, \nYe husbandmen; in winter's dust the crops \nExceedingly rejoice, the field hath joy; \nNo tilth makes Mysia lift her head so high, \nNor Gargarus his own harvests so admire. \nWhy tell of him, who, having launched his seed, \nSets on for close encounter, and rakes smooth \nThe dry dust hillocks, then on the tender corn \nLets in the flood, whose waters follow fain; \nAnd when the parched field quivers, and all the blades \nAre dying, from the brow of its hill-bed, \nSee! see! he lures the runnel; down it falls, \nWaking hoarse murmurs o'er the polished stones, \nAnd with its bubblings slakes the thirsty fields? \nOr why of him, who lest the heavy ears \nO'erweigh the stalk, while yet in tender blade \nFeeds down the crop's luxuriance, when its growth \nFirst tops the furrows? Why of him who drains \nThe marsh-land's gathered ooze through soaking sand, \nChiefly what time in treacherous moons a stream \nGoes out in spate, and with its coat of slime \nHolds all the country, whence the hollow dykes \nSweat steaming vapour? \n\nBut no whit the more \nFor all expedients tried and travail borne \nBy man and beast in turning oft the soil, \nDo greedy goose and Strymon-haunting cranes \nAnd succory's bitter fibres cease to harm, \nOr shade not injure. The great Sire himself \nNo easy road to husbandry assigned, \nAnd first was he by human skill to rouse \nThe slumbering glebe, whetting the minds of men \nWith care on care, nor suffering realm of his \nIn drowsy sloth to stagnate. Before Jove \nFields knew no taming hand of husbandmen; \nTo mark the plain or mete with boundary-line- \nEven this was impious; for the common stock \nThey gathered, and the earth of her own will \nAll things more freely, no man bidding, bore. \nHe to black serpents gave their venom-bane, \nAnd bade the wolf go prowl, and ocean toss; \nShook from the leaves their honey, put fire away, \nAnd curbed the random rivers running wine, \nThat use by gradual dint of thought on thought \nMight forge the various arts, with furrow's help \nThe corn-blade win, and strike out hidden fire \nFrom the flint's heart. Then first the streams were ware\n\nOf hollowed alder-hulls: the sailor then \nTheir names and numbers gave to star and star, \nPleiads and Hyads, and Lycaon's child \nBright Arctos; how with nooses then was found \nTo catch wild beasts, and cozen them with lime, \nAnd hem with hounds the mighty forest-glades. \nSoon one with hand-net scourges the broad stream, \nProbing its depths, one drags his dripping toils \nAlong the main; then iron's unbending might, \nAnd shrieking saw-blade,- for the men of old \nWith wedges wont to cleave the splintering log;- \nThen divers arts arose; toil conquered all, \nRemorseless toil, and poverty's shrewd push \nIn times of hardship. Ceres was the first \nSet mortals on with tools to turn the sod, \nWhen now the awful groves 'gan fail to bear \nAcorns and arbutes, and her wonted food \nDodona gave no more. Soon, too, the corn \nGat sorrow's increase, that an evil blight \nAte up the stalks, and thistle reared his spines \nAn idler in the fields; the crops die down; \nUpsprings instead a shaggy growth of burrs \nAnd caltrops; and amid the corn-fields trim \nUnfruitful darnel and wild oats have sway. \nWherefore, unless thou shalt with ceaseless rake \nThe weeds pursue, with shouting scare the birds, \nPrune with thy hook the dark field's matted shade, \nPray down the showers, all vainly thou shalt eye, \nAlack! thy neighbour's heaped-up harvest-mow, \nAnd in the greenwood from a shaken oak \nSeek solace for thine hunger. \n\nNow to tell \nThe sturdy rustics' weapons, what they are, \nWithout which, neither can be sown nor reared \nThe fruits of harvest; first the bent plough's share \nAnd heavy timber, and slow-lumbering wains \nOf the Eleusinian mother, threshing-sleighs \nAnd drags, and harrows with their crushing weight; \nThen the cheap wicker-ware of Celeus old, \nHurdles of arbute, and thy mystic fan, \nIacchus; which, full tale, long ere the time \nThou must with heed lay by, if thee await \nNot all unearned the country's crown divine. \nWhile yet within the woods, the elm is tamed \nAnd bowed with mighty force to form the stock, \nAnd take the plough's curved shape, then nigh the root \nA pole eight feet projecting, earth-boards twain, \nAnd share-beam with its double back they fix. \nFor yoke is early hewn a linden light, \nAnd a tall beech for handle, from behind \nTo turn the car at lowest: then o'er the hearth \nThe wood they hang till the smoke knows it well. \nMany the precepts of the men of old \nI can recount thee, so thou start not back, \nAnd such slight cares to learn not weary thee. \nAnd this among the first: thy threshing-floor \nWith ponderous roller must be levelled smooth, \nAnd wrought by hand, and fixed with binding chalk, \nLest weeds arise, or dust a passage win \nSplitting the surface, then a thousand plagues \nMake sport of it: oft builds the tiny mouse \nHer home, and plants her granary, underground, \nOr burrow for their bed the purblind moles, \nOr toad is found in hollows, and all the swarm \nOf earth's unsightly creatures; or a huge \nCorn-heap the weevil plunders, and the ant, \nFearful of coming age and penury. \nMark too, what time the walnut in the woods \nWith ample bloom shall clothe her, and bow down \nHer odorous branches, if the fruit prevail, \nLike store of grain will follow, and there shall come \nA mighty winnowing-time with mighty heat; \nBut if the shade with wealth of leaves abound, \nVainly your threshing-floor will bruise the stalks \nRich but in chaff. Many myself have seen \nSteep, as they sow, their pulse-seeds, drenching them \nWith nitre and black oil-lees, that the fruit \nMight swell within the treacherous pods, and they \nMake speed to boil at howso small a fire. \nYet, culled with caution, proved with patient toil, \nThese have I seen degenerate, did not man \nPut forth his hand with power, and year by year \nChoose out the largest. So, by fate impelled, \nSpeed all things to the worse, and backward borne \nGlide from us; even as who with struggling oars \nUp stream scarce pulls a shallop, if he chance \nHis arms to slacken, lo! with headlong force \nThe current sweeps him down the hurrying tide. \nUs too behoves Arcturus' sign observe, \nAnd the Kids' seasons and the shining Snake, \nNo less than those who o'er the windy main \nBorne homeward tempt the Pontic, and the jaws \nOf oyster-rife Abydos. When the Scales \nNow poising fair the hours of sleep and day \nGive half the world to sunshine, half to shade, \nThen urge your bulls, my masters; sow the plain \nEven to the verge of tameless winter's showers \nWith barley: then, too, time it is to hide \nYour flax in earth, and poppy, Ceres' joy, \nAye, more than time to bend above the plough, \nWhile earth, yet dry, forbids not, and the clouds \nAre buoyant. With the spring comes bean-sowing; \nThee, too, Lucerne, the crumbling furrows then \nReceive, and millet's annual care returns, \nWhat time the white bull with his gilded horns \nOpens the year, before whose threatening front, \nRouted the dog-star sinks. But if it be \nFor wheaten harvest and the hardy spelt, \nThou tax the soil, to corn-ears wholly given, \nLet Atlas' daughters hide them in the dawn, \nThe Cretan star, a crown of fire, depart, \nOr e'er the furrow's claim of seed thou quit, \nOr haste thee to entrust the whole year's hope \nTo earth that would not. Many have begun \nEre Maia's star be setting; these, I trow, \nTheir looked-for harvest fools with empty ears. \nBut if the vetch and common kidney-bean \nThou'rt fain to sow, nor scorn to make thy care \nPelusiac lentil, no uncertain sign \nBootes' fall will send thee; then begin, \nPursue thy sowing till half the frosts be done. \nTherefore it is the golden sun, his course \nInto fixed parts dividing, rules his way \nThrough the twelve constellations of the world. \nFive zones the heavens contain; whereof is one \nAye red with flashing sunlight, fervent aye \nFrom fire; on either side to left and right \nAre traced the utmost twain, stiff with blue ice, \nAnd black with scowling storm-clouds, and betwixt \nThese and the midmost, other twain there lie, \nBy the Gods' grace to heart-sick mortals given, \nAnd a path cleft between them, where might wheel \nOn sloping plane the system of the Signs. \nAnd as toward Scythia and Rhipaean heights \nThe world mounts upward, likewise sinks it down \nToward Libya and the south, this pole of ours \nStill towering high, that other, 'neath their feet, \nBy dark Styx frowned on, and the abysmal shades. \nHere glides the huge Snake forth with sinuous coils \n'Twixt the two Bears and round them river-wise- \nThe Bears that fear 'neath Ocean's brim to dip. \nThere either, say they, reigns the eternal hush \nOf night that knows no seasons, her black pall \nThick-mantling fold on fold; or thitherward \nFrom us returning Dawn brings back the day; \nAnd when the first breath of his panting steeds \nOn us the Orient flings, that hour with them \nRed Vesper 'gins to trim his his 'lated fires. \nHence under doubtful skies forebode we can \nThe coming tempests, hence both harvest-day \nAnd seed-time, when to smite the treacherous main \nWith driving oars, when launch the fair-rigged fleet, \nOr in ripe hour to fell the forest-pine. \nHence, too, not idly do we watch the stars- \nTheir rising and their setting-and the year, \nFour varying seasons to one law conformed. \nIf chilly showers e'er shut the farmer's door, \nMuch that had soon with sunshine cried for haste, \nHe may forestall; the ploughman batters keen \nHis blunted share's hard tooth, scoops from a tree \nHis troughs, or on the cattle stamps a brand, \nOr numbers on the corn-heaps; some make sharp \nThe stakes and two-pronged forks, and willow-bands \nAmerian for the bending vine prepare. \nNow let the pliant basket plaited be \nOf bramble-twigs; now set your corn to parch \nBefore the fire; now bruise it with the stone. \nNay even on holy days some tasks to ply \nIs right and lawful: this no ban forbids, \nTo turn the runnel's course, fence corn-fields in, \nMake springes for the birds, burn up the briars, \nAnd plunge in wholesome stream the bleating flock. \nOft too with oil or apples plenty-cheap \nThe creeping ass's ribs his driver packs, \nAnd home from town returning brings instead \nA dented mill-stone or black lump of pitch. \nThe moon herself in various rank assigns \nThe days for labour lucky: fly the fifth; \nThen sprang pale Orcus and the Eumenides; \nEarth then in awful labour brought to light \nCoeus, Iapetus, and Typhoeus fell, \nAnd those sworn brethren banded to break down \nThe gates of heaven; thrice, sooth to say, they strove \nOssa on Pelion's top to heave and heap, \nAye, and on Ossa to up-roll amain \nLeafy Olympus; thrice with thunderbolt \nTheir mountain-stair the Sire asunder smote. \nSeventh after tenth is lucky both to set \nThe vine in earth, and take and tame the steer, \nAnd fix the leashes to the warp; the ninth \nTo runagates is kinder, cross to thieves. \nMany the tasks that lightlier lend themselves \nIn chilly night, or when the sun is young, \nAnd Dawn bedews the world. By night 'tis best \nTo reap light stubble, and parched fields by night; \nFor nights the suppling moisture never fails. \nAnd one will sit the long late watches out \nBy winter fire-light, shaping with keen blade \nThe torches to a point; his wife the while, \nHer tedious labour soothing with a song, \nSpeeds the shrill comb along the warp, or else \nWith Vulcan's aid boils the sweet must-juice down, \nAnd skims with leaves the quivering cauldron's wave. \nBut ruddy Ceres in mid heat is mown, \nAnd in mid heat the parched ears are bruised \nUpon the floor; to plough strip, strip to sow; \nWinter's the lazy time for husbandmen. \nIn the cold season farmers wont to taste \nThe increase of their toil, and yield themselves \nTo mutual interchange of festal cheer. \nBoon winter bids them, and unbinds their cares, \nAs laden keels, when now the port they touch, \nAnd happy sailors crown the sterns with flowers. \nNathless then also time it is to strip \nAcorns from oaks, and berries from the bay, \nOlives, and bleeding myrtles, then to set \nSnares for the crane, and meshes for the stag, \nAnd hunt the long-eared hares, then pierce the doe \nWith whirl of hempen-thonged Balearic sling, \nWhile snow lies deep, and streams are drifting ice. \nWhat need to tell of autumn's storms and stars, \nAnd wherefore men must watch, when now the day \nGrows shorter, and more soft the summer's heat? \nWhen Spring the rain-bringer comes rushing down, \nOr when the beards of harvest on the plain \nBristle already, and the milky corn \nOn its green stalk is swelling? Many a time, \nWhen now the farmer to his yellow fields \nThe reaping-hind came bringing, even in act \nTo lop the brittle barley stems, have I \nSeen all the windy legions clash in war \nTogether, as to rend up far and wide \nThe heavy corn-crop from its lowest roots, \nAnd toss it skyward: so might winter's flaw, \nDark-eddying, whirl light stalks and flying straws. \nOft too comes looming vast along the sky \nA march of waters; mustering from above, \nThe clouds roll up the tempest, heaped and grim \nWith angry showers: down falls the height of heaven, \nAnd with a great rain floods the smiling crops, \nThe oxen's labour: now the dikes fill fast, \nAnd the void river-beds swell thunderously, \nAnd all the panting firths of Ocean boil. \nThe Sire himself in midnight of the clouds \nWields with red hand the levin; through all her bulk \nEarth at the hurly quakes; the beasts are fled, \nAnd mortal hearts of every kindred sunk \nIn cowering terror; he with flaming brand \nAthos, or Rhodope, or Ceraunian crags \nPrecipitates: then doubly raves the South \nWith shower on blinding shower, and woods and coasts \nWail fitfully beneath the mighty blast. \nThis fearing, mark the months and Signs of heaven, \nWhither retires him Saturn's icy star, \nAnd through what heavenly cycles wandereth \nThe glowing orb Cyllenian. Before all \nWorship the Gods, and to great Ceres pay \nHer yearly dues upon the happy sward \nWith sacrifice, anigh the utmost end \nOf winter, and when Spring begins to smile. \nThen lambs are fat, and wines are mellowest then; \nThen sleep is sweet, and dark the shadows fall \nUpon the mountains. Let your rustic youth \nTo Ceres do obeisance, one and all; \nAnd for her pleasure thou mix honeycombs \nWith milk and the ripe wine-god; thrice for luck \nAround the young corn let the victim go, \nAnd all the choir, a joyful company, \nAttend it, and with shouts bid Ceres come \nTo be their house-mate; and let no man dare \nPut sickle to the ripened ears until, \nWith woven oak his temples chapleted, \nHe foot the rugged dance and chant the lay. \nAye, and that these things we might win to know \nBy certain tokens, heats, and showers, and winds \nThat bring the frost, the Sire of all himself \nOrdained what warnings in her monthly round \nThe moon should give, what bodes the south wind's fall, \nWhat oft-repeated sights the herdsman seeing \nShould keep his cattle closer to their stalls. \nNo sooner are the winds at point to rise, \nThan either Ocean's firths begin to toss \nAnd swell, and a dry crackling sound is heard \nUpon the heights, or one loud ferment booms \nThe beach afar, and through the forest goes \nA murmur multitudinous. By this \nScarce can the billow spare the curved keels, \nWhen swift the sea-gulls from the middle main \nCome winging, and their shrieks are shoreward borne, \nWhen ocean-loving cormorants on dry land \nBesport them, and the hern, her marshy haunts \nForsaking, mounts above the soaring cloud. \nOft, too, when wind is toward, the stars thou'lt see \nFrom heaven shoot headlong, and through murky night \nLong trails of fire white-glistening in their wake, \nOr light chaff flit in air with fallen leaves, \nOr feathers on the wave-top float and play. \nBut when from regions of the furious North \nIt lightens, and when thunder fills the halls \nOf Eurus and of Zephyr, all the fields \nWith brimming dikes are flooded, and at sea \nNo mariner but furls his dripping sails. \nNever at unawares did shower annoy: \nOr, as it rises, the high-soaring cranes \nFlee to the vales before it, with face \nUpturned to heaven, the heifer snuffs the gale \nThrough gaping nostrils, or about the meres \nShrill-twittering flits the swallow, and the frogs \nCrouch in the mud and chant their dirge of old. \nOft, too, the ant from out her inmost cells, \nFretting the narrow path, her eggs conveys; \nOr the huge bow sucks moisture; or a host \nOf rooks from food returning in long line \nClamour with jostling wings. Now mayst thou see \nThe various ocean-fowl and those that pry \nRound Asian meads within thy fresher-pools, \nCayster, as in eager rivalry, \nAbout their shoulders dash the plenteous spray, \nNow duck their head beneath the wave, now run \nInto the billows, for sheer idle joy \nOf their mad bathing-revel. Then the crow \nWith full voice, good-for-naught, inviting rain, \nStalks on the dry sand mateless and alone. \nNor e'en the maids, that card their nightly task, \nKnow not the storm-sign, when in blazing crock \nThey see the lamp-oil sputtering with a growth \nOf mouldy snuff-clots. \n\nSo too, after rain, \nSunshine and open skies thou mayst forecast, \nAnd learn by tokens sure, for then nor dimmed \nAppear the stars' keen edges, nor the moon \nAs borrowing of her brother's beams to rise, \nNor fleecy films to float along the sky. \nNot to the sun's warmth then upon the shore \nDo halcyons dear to Thetis ope their wings, \nNor filthy swine take thought to toss on high \nWith scattering snout the straw-wisps. But the clouds \nSeek more the vales, and rest upon the plain, \nAnd from the roof-top the night-owl for naught \nWatching the sunset plies her 'lated song. \nDistinct in clearest air is Nisus seen \nTowering, and Scylla for the purple lock \nPays dear; for whereso, as she flies, her wings \nThe light air winnow, lo! fierce, implacable, \nNisus with mighty whirr through heaven pursues; \nWhere Nisus heavenward soareth, there her wings \nClutch as she flies, the light air winnowing still. \nSoft then the voice of rooks from indrawn throat \nThrice, four times, o'er repeated, and full oft \nOn their high cradles, by some hidden joy \nGladdened beyond their wont, in bustling throngs \nAmong the leaves they riot; so sweet it is, \nWhen showers are spent, their own loved nests again \nAnd tender brood to visit. Not, I deem, \nThat heaven some native wit to these assigned, \nOr fate a larger prescience, but that when \nThe storm and shifting moisture of the air \nHave changed their courses, and the sky-god now, \nWet with the south-wind, thickens what was rare, \nAnd what was gross releases, then, too, change \nTheir spirits' fleeting phases, and their breasts \nFeel other motions now, than when the wind \nWas driving up the cloud-rack. Hence proceeds \nThat blending of the feathered choirs afield, \nThe cattle's exultation, and the rooks' \nDeep-throated triumph. \n\nBut if the headlong sun \nAnd moons in order following thou regard, \nNe'er will to-morrow's hour deceive thee, ne'er \nWilt thou be caught by guile of cloudless night. \nWhen first the moon recalls her rallying fires, \nIf dark the air clipped by her crescent dim, \nFor folks afield and on the open sea \nA mighty rain is brewing; but if her face \nWith maiden blush she mantle, 'twill be wind, \nFor wind turns Phoebe still to ruddier gold. \nBut if at her fourth rising, for 'tis that \nGives surest counsel, clear she ride thro' heaven \nWith horns unblunted, then shall that whole day, \nAnd to the month's end those that spring from it, \nRainless and windless be, while safe ashore \nShall sailors pay their vows to Panope, \nGlaucus, and Melicertes, Ino's child. \nThe sun too, both at rising, and when soon \nHe dives beneath the waves, shall yield thee signs; \nFor signs, none trustier, travel with the sun, \nBoth those which in their course with dawn he brings, \nAnd those at star-rise. When his springing orb \nWith spots he pranketh, muffled in a cloud, \nAnd shrinks mid-circle, then of showers beware; \nFor then the South comes driving from the deep, \nTo trees and crops and cattle bringing bane. \nOr when at day-break through dark clouds his rays \nBurst and are scattered, or when rising pale \nAurora quits Tithonus' saffron bed, \nBut sorry shelter then, alack I will yield \nVine-leaf to ripening grapes; so thick a hail \nIn spiky showers spins rattling on the roof. \nAnd this yet more 'twill boot thee bear in mind, \nWhen now, his course upon Olympus run, \nHe draws to his decline: for oft we see \nUpon the sun's own face strange colours stray; \nDark tells of rain, of east winds fiery-red; \nIf spots with ruddy fire begin to mix, \nThen all the heavens convulsed in wrath thou'lt see- \nStorm-clouds and wind together. Me that night \nLet no man bid fare forth upon the deep, \nNor rend the rope from shore. But if, when both \nHe brings again and hides the day's return, \nClear-orbed he shineth,idly wilt thou dread \nThe storm-clouds, and beneath the lustral North \nSee the woods waving. What late eve in fine \nBears in her bosom, whence the wind that brings \nFair-weather-clouds, or what the rain South \nIs meditating, tokens of all these \nThe sun will give thee. Who dare charge the sun \nWith leasing? He it is who warneth oft \nOf hidden broils at hand and treachery, \nAnd secret swelling of the waves of war. \nHe too it was, when Caesar's light was quenched, \nFor Rome had pity, when his bright head he veiled \nIn iron-hued darkness, till a godless age \nTrembled for night eternal; at that time \nHowbeit earth also, and the ocean-plains, \nAnd dogs obscene, and birds of evil bode \nGave tokens. Yea, how often have we seen \nEtna, her furnace-walls asunder riven, \nIn billowy floods boil o'er the Cyclops' fields, \nAnd roll down globes of fire and molten rocks! \nA clash of arms through all the heaven was heard \nBy Germany; strange heavings shook the Alps. \nYea, and by many through the breathless groves \nA voice was heard with power, and wondrous-pale \nPhantoms were seen upon the dusk of night, \nAnd cattle spake, portentous! streams stand still, \nAnd the earth yawns asunder, ivory weeps \nFor sorrow in the shrines, and bronzes sweat. \nUp-twirling forests with his eddying tide, \nMadly he bears them down, that lord of floods, \nEridanus, till through all the plain are swept \nBeasts and their stalls together. At that time \nIn gloomy entrails ceased not to appear \nDark-threatening fibres, springs to trickle blood, \nAnd high-built cities night-long to resound \nWith the wolves' howling. Never more than then \nFrom skies all cloudless fell the thunderbolts, \nNor blazed so oft the comet's fire of bale. \nTherefore a second time Philippi saw \nThe Roman hosts with kindred weapons rush \nTo battle, nor did the high gods deem it hard \nThat twice Emathia and the wide champaign \nOf Haemus should be fattening with our blood. \nAy, and the time will come when there anigh, \nHeaving the earth up with his curved plough, \nSome swain will light on javelins by foul rust \nCorroded, or with ponderous harrow strike \nOn empty helmets, while he gapes to see \nBones as of giants from the trench untombed. \nGods of my country, heroes of the soil, \nAnd Romulus, and Mother Vesta, thou \nWho Tuscan Tiber and Rome's Palatine \nPreservest, this new champion at the least \nOur fallen generation to repair \nForbid not. To the full and long ago \nOur blood thy Trojan perjuries hath paid, \nLaomedon. Long since the courts of heaven \nBegrudge us thee, our Caesar, and complain \nThat thou regard'st the triumphs of mankind, \nHere where the wrong is right, the right is wrong, \nWhere wars abound so many, and myriad-faced \nIs crime; where no meet honour hath the plough; \nThe fields, their husbandmen led far away, \nRot in neglect, and curved pruning-hooks \nInto the sword's stiff blade are fused and forged. \nEuphrates here, here Germany new strife \nIs stirring; neighbouring cities are in arms, \nThe laws that bound them snapped; and godless war \nRages through all the universe; as when \nThe four-horse chariots from the barriers poured \nStill quicken o'er the course, and, idly now \nGrasping the reins, the driver by his team \nIs onward borne, nor heeds the car his curb. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGEORGIC II\n\nThus far the tilth of fields and stars of heaven; \nNow will I sing thee, Bacchus, and, with thee, \nThe forest's young plantations and the fruit \nOf slow-maturing olive. Hither haste, \nO Father of the wine-press; all things here \nTeem with the bounties of thy hand; for thee \nWith viny autumn laden blooms the field, \nAnd foams the vintage high with brimming vats; \nHither, O Father of the wine-press, come, \nAnd stripped of buskin stain thy bared limbs \nIn the new must with me. \n\nFirst, nature's law \nFor generating trees is manifold; \nFor some of their own force spontaneous spring, \nNo hand of man compelling, and possess \nThe plains and river-windings far and wide, \nAs pliant osier and the bending broom, \nPoplar, and willows in wan companies \nWith green leaf glimmering gray; and some there be \nFrom chance-dropped seed that rear them, as the tall \nChestnuts, and, mightiest of the branching wood, \nJove's Aesculus, and oaks, oracular \nDeemed by the Greeks of old. With some sprouts forth \nA forest of dense suckers from the root, \nAs elms and cherries; so, too, a pigmy plant, \nBeneath its mother's mighty shade upshoots \nThe bay-tree of Parnassus. Such the modes \nNature imparted first; hence all the race \nOf forest-trees and shrubs and sacred groves \nSprings into verdure. \n\nOther means there are, \nWhich use by method for itself acquired. \nOne, sliving suckers from the tender frame \nOf the tree-mother, plants them in the trench; \nOne buries the bare stumps within his field, \nTruncheons cleft four-wise, or sharp-pointed stakes; \nSome forest-trees the layer's bent arch await, \nAnd slips yet quick within the parent-soil; \nNo root need others, nor doth the pruner's hand \nShrink to restore the topmost shoot to earth \nThat gave it being. Nay, marvellous to tell, \nLopped of its limbs, the olive, a mere stock, \nStill thrusts its root out from the sapless wood, \nAnd oft the branches of one kind we see \nChange to another's with no loss to rue, \nPear-tree transformed the ingrafted apple yield, \nAnd stony cornels on the plum-tree blush. \nCome then, and learn what tilth to each belongs \nAccording to their kinds, ye husbandmen, \nAnd tame with culture the wild fruits, lest earth \nLie idle. O blithe to make all Ismarus \nOne forest of the wine-god, and to clothe \nWith olives huge Tabernus! And be thou \nAt hand, and with me ply the voyage of toil \nI am bound on, O my glory, O thou that art \nJustly the chiefest portion of my fame, \nMaecenas, and on this wide ocean launched \nSpread sail like wings to waft thee. Not that I \nWith my poor verse would comprehend the whole, \nNay, though a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths \nWere mine, a voice of iron; be thou at hand, \nSkirt but the nearer coast-line; see the shore \nIs in our grasp; not now with feigned song \nThrough winding bouts and tedious preludings \nShall I detain thee. \n\nThose that lift their head \nInto the realms of light spontaneously, \nFruitless indeed, but blithe and strenuous spring, \nSince Nature lurks within the soil. And yet \nEven these, should one engraft them, or transplant \nTo well-drilled trenches, will anon put of \nTheir woodland temper, and, by frequent tilth, \nTo whatso craft thou summon them, make speed \nTo follow. So likewise will the barren shaft \nThat from the stock-root issueth, if it be \nSet out with clear space amid open fields: \nNow the tree-mother's towering leaves and boughs \nDarken, despoil of increase as it grows, \nAnd blast it in the bearing. Lastly, that \nWhich from shed seed ariseth, upward wins \nBut slowly, yielding promise of its shade \nTo late-born generations; apples wane \nForgetful of their former juice, the grape \nBears sorry clusters, for the birds a prey. \nSoothly on all must toil be spent, and all \nTrained to the trench and at great cost subdued. \nBut reared from truncheons olives answer best, \nAs vines from layers, and from the solid wood \nThe Paphian myrtles; while from suckers spring \nBoth hardy hazels and huge ash, the tree \nThat rims with shade the brows of Hercules, \nAnd acorns dear to the Chaonian sire: \nSo springs the towering palm too, and the fir \nDestined to spy the dangers of the deep. \nBut the rough arbutus with walnut-fruit \nIs grafted; so have barren planes ere now \nStout apples borne, with chestnut-flower the beech, \nThe mountain-ash with pear-bloom whitened o'er, \nAnd swine crunched acorns 'neath the boughs of elms. \nNor is the method of inserting eyes \nAnd grafting one: for where the buds push forth \nAmidst the bark, and burst the membranes thin, \nEven on the knot a narrow rift is made, \nWherein from some strange tree a germ they pen, \nAnd to the moist rind bid it cleave and grow. \nOr, otherwise, in knotless trunks is hewn \nA breach, and deep into the solid grain \nA path with wedges cloven; then fruitful slips \nAre set herein, and- no long time- behold! \nTo heaven upshot with teeming boughs, the tree \nStrange leaves admires and fruitage not its own. \nNor of one kind alone are sturdy elms, \nWillow and lotus, nor the cypress-trees \nOf Ida; nor of self-same fashion spring \nFat olives, orchades, and radii \nAnd bitter-berried pausians, no, nor yet \nApples and the forests of Alcinous; \nNor from like cuttings are Crustumian pears \nAnd Syrian, and the heavy hand-fillers. \nNot the same vintage from our trees hangs down, \nWhich Lesbos from Methymna's tendril plucks. \nVines Thasian are there, Mareotids white, \nThese apt for richer soils, for lighter those: \nPsithian for raisin-wine more useful, thin \nLageos, that one day will try the feet \nAnd tie the tongue: purples and early-ripes, \nAnd how, O Rhaetian, shall I hymn thy praise? \nYet cope not therefore with Falernian bins. \nVines Aminaean too, best-bodied wine, \nTo which the Tmolian bows him, ay, and king \nPhanaeus too, and, lesser of that name, \nArgitis, wherewith not a grape can vie \nFor gush of wine-juice or for length of years. \nNor thee must I pass over, vine of Rhodes, \nWelcomed by gods and at the second board, \nNor thee, Bumastus, with plump clusters swollen. \nBut lo! how many kinds, and what their names, \nThere is no telling, nor doth it boot to tell; \nWho lists to know it, he too would list to learn \nHow many sand-grains are by Zephyr tossed \nOn Libya's plain, or wot, when Eurus falls \nWith fury on the ships, how many waves \nCome rolling shoreward from the Ionian sea. \nNot that all soils can all things bear alike. \nWillows by water-courses have their birth, \nAlders in miry fens; on rocky heights \nThe barren mountain-ashes; on the shore \nMyrtles throng gayest; Bacchus, lastly, loves \nThe bare hillside, and yews the north wind's chill. \nMark too the earth by outland tillers tamed, \nAnd Eastern homes of Arabs, and tattooed \nGeloni; to all trees their native lands \nAllotted are; no clime but India bears \nBlack ebony; the branch of frankincense \nIs Saba's sons' alone; why tell to thee \nOf balsams oozing from the perfumed wood, \nOr berries of acanthus ever green? \nOf Aethiop forests hoar with downy wool, \nOr how the Seres comb from off the leaves \nTheir silky fleece? Of groves which India bears, \nOcean's near neighbour, earth's remotest nook, \nWhere not an arrow-shot can cleave the air \nAbove their tree-tops? yet no laggards they, \nWhen girded with the quiver! Media yields \nThe bitter juices and slow-lingering taste \nOf the blest citron-fruit, than which no aid \nComes timelier, when fierce step-dames drug the cup \nWith simples mixed and spells of baneful power, \nTo drive the deadly poison from the limbs. \nLarge the tree's self in semblance like a bay, \nAnd, showered it not a different scent abroad, \nA bay it had been; for no wind of heaven \nIts foliage falls; the flower, none faster, clings; \nWith it the Medes for sweetness lave the lips, \nAnd ease the panting breathlessness of age. \nBut no, not Mede-land with its wealth of woods, \nNor Ganges fair, and Hermus thick with gold, \nCan match the praise of Italy; nor Ind, \nNor Bactria, nor Panchaia, one wide tract \nOf incense-teeming sand. Here never bulls \nWith nostrils snorting fire upturned the sod \nSown with the monstrous dragon's teeth, nor crop \nOf warriors bristled thick with lance and helm; \nBut heavy harvests and the Massic juice \nOf Bacchus fill its borders, overspread \nWith fruitful flocks and olives. Hence arose \nThe war-horse stepping proudly o'er the plain; \nHence thy white flocks, Clitumnus, and the bull, \nOf victims mightiest, which full oft have led, \nBathed in thy sacred stream, the triumph-pomp \nOf Romans to the temples of the gods. \nHere blooms perpetual spring, and summer here \nIn months that are not summer's; twice teem the flocks; \nTwice doth the tree yield service of her fruit. \nBut ravening tigers come not nigh, nor breed \nOf savage lion, nor aconite betrays \nIts hapless gatherers, nor with sweep so vast \nDoth the scaled serpent trail his endless coils \nAlong the ground, or wreathe him into spires. \nMark too her cities, so many and so proud, \nOf mighty toil the achievement, town on town \nUp rugged precipices heaved and reared, \nAnd rivers undergliding ancient walls. \nOr should I celebrate the sea that laves \nHer upper shores and lower? or those broad lakes? \nThee, Larius, greatest and, Benacus, thee \nWith billowy uproar surging like the main? \nOr sing her harbours, and the barrier cast \nAthwart the Lucrine, and how ocean chafes \nWith mighty bellowings, where the Julian wave \nEchoes the thunder of his rout, and through \nAvernian inlets pours the Tuscan tide? \nA land no less that in her veins displays \nRivers of silver, mines of copper ore, \nAy, and with gold hath flowed abundantly. \nA land that reared a valiant breed of men, \nThe Marsi and Sabellian youth, and, schooled \nTo hardship, the Ligurian, and with these \nThe Volscian javelin-armed, the Decii too, \nThe Marii and Camilli, names of might, \nThe Scipios, stubborn warriors, ay, and thee, \nGreat Caesar, who in Asia's utmost bounds \nWith conquering arm e'en now art fending far \nThe unwarlike Indian from the heights of Rome. \nHail! land of Saturn, mighty mother thou \nOf fruits and heroes; 'tis for thee I dare \nUnseal the sacred fountains, and essay \nThemes of old art and glory, as I sing \nThe song of Ascra through the towns of Rome. \nNow for the native gifts of various soils, \nWhat powers hath each, what hue, what natural bent \nFor yielding increase. First your stubborn lands \nAnd churlish hill-sides, where are thorny fields \nOf meagre marl and gravel, these delight \nIn long-lived olive-groves to Pallas dear. \nTake for a sign the plenteous growth hard by \nOf oleaster, and the fields strewn wide \nWith woodland berries. But a soil that's rich, \nIn moisture sweet exulting, and the plain \nThat teems with grasses on its fruitful breast, \nSuch as full oft in hollow mountain-dell \nWe view beneath us- from the craggy heights \nStreams thither flow with fertilizing mud- \nA plain which southward rising feeds the fern \nBy curved ploughs detested, this one day \nShall yield thee store of vines full strong to gush \nIn torrents of the wine-god; this shall be \nFruitful of grapes and flowing juice like that \nWe pour to heaven from bowls of gold, what time \nThe sleek Etruscan at the altar blows \nHis ivory pipe, and on the curved dish \nWe lay the reeking entrails. If to rear \nCattle delight thee rather, steers, or lambs, \nOr goats that kill the tender plants, then seek \nFull-fed Tarentum's glades and distant fields, \nOr such a plain as luckless Mantua lost \nWhose weedy water feeds the snow-white swan: \nThere nor clear springs nor grass the flocks will fail, \nAnd all the day-long browsing of thy herds \nShall the cool dews of one brief night repair. \nLand which the burrowing share shows dark and rich, \nWith crumbling soil- for this we counterfeit \nIn ploughing- for corn is goodliest; from no field \nMore wains thou'lt see wend home with plodding steers; \nOr that from which the husbandman in spleen \nHas cleared the timber, and o'erthrown the copse \nThat year on year lay idle, and from the roots \nUptorn the immemorial haunt of birds; \nThey banished from their nests have sought the skies; \nBut the rude plain beneath the ploughshare's stroke \nStarts into sudden brightness. For indeed \nThe starved hill-country gravel scarce serves the bees \nWith lowly cassias and with rosemary; \nRough tufa and chalk too, by black water-worms \nGnawed through and through, proclaim no soils beside \nSo rife with serpent-dainties, or that yield \nSuch winding lairs to lurk in. That again, \nWhich vapoury mist and flitting smoke exhales, \nDrinks moisture up and casts it forth at will, \nWhich, ever in its own green grass arrayed, \nMars not the metal with salt scurf of rust- \nThat shall thine elms with merry vines enwreathe; \nThat teems with olive; that shall thy tilth prove kind \nTo cattle, and patient of the curved share. \nSuch ploughs rich Capua, such the coast that skirts \nThy ridge, Vesuvius, and the Clanian flood, \nAcerrae's desolation and her bane. \nHow each to recognize now hear me tell. \nDost ask if loose or passing firm it be- \nSince one for corn hath liking, one for wine, \nThe firmer sort for Ceres, none too loose \nFor thee, Lyaeus?- with scrutinizing eye \nFirst choose thy ground, and bid a pit be sunk \nDeep in the solid earth, then cast the mould \nAll back again, and stamp the surface smooth. \nIf it suffice not, loose will be the land, \nMore meet for cattle and for kindly vines; \nBut if, rebellious, to its proper bounds \nThe soil returns not, but fills all the trench \nAnd overtops it, then the glebe is gross; \nLook for stiff ridges and reluctant clods, \nAnd with strong bullocks cleave the fallow crust. \nSalt ground again, and bitter, as 'tis called- \nBarren for fruits, by tilth untamable, \nNor grape her kind, nor apples their good name \nMaintaining- will in this wise yield thee proof: \nStout osier-baskets from the rafter-smoke, \nAnd strainers of the winepress pluck thee down; \nHereinto let that evil land, with fresh \nSpring-water mixed, be trampled to the full; \nThe moisture, mark you, will ooze all away, \nIn big drops issuing through the osier-withes, \nBut plainly will its taste the secret tell, \nAnd with a harsh twang ruefully distort \nThe mouths of them that try it. Rich soil again \nWe learn on this wise: tossed from hand to hand \nYet cracks it never, but pitch-like, as we hold, \nClings to the fingers. A land with moisture rife \nBreeds lustier herbage, and is more than meet \nProlific. Ah I may never such for me \nO'er-fertile prove, or make too stout a show \nAt the first earing! Heavy land or light \nThe mute self-witness of its weight betrays. \nA glance will serve to warn thee which is black, \nOr what the hue of any. But hard it is \nTo track the signs of that pernicious cold: \nPines only, noxious yews, and ivies dark \nAt times reveal its traces. \n\nAll these rules \nRegarding, let your land, ay, long before, \nScorch to the quick, and into trenches carve \nThe mighty mountains, and their upturned clods \nBare to the north wind, ere thou plant therein \nThe vine's prolific kindred. Fields whose soil \nIs crumbling are the best: winds look to that, \nAnd bitter hoar-frosts, and the delver's toil \nUntiring, as he stirs the loosened glebe. \nBut those, whose vigilance no care escapes, \nSearch for a kindred site, where first to rear \nA nursery for the trees, and eke whereto \nSoon to translate them, lest the sudden shock \nFrom their new mother the young plants estrange. \nNay, even the quarter of the sky they brand \nUpon the bark, that each may be restored, \nAs erst it stood, here bore the southern heats, \nHere turned its shoulder to the northern pole; \nSo strong is custom formed in early years. \nWhether on hill or plain 'tis best to plant \nYour vineyard first inquire. If on some plain \nYou measure out rich acres, then plant thick; \nThick planting makes no niggard of the vine; \nBut if on rising mound or sloping bill, \nThen let the rows have room, so none the less \nEach line you draw, when all the trees are set, \nMay tally to perfection. Even as oft \nIn mighty war, whenas the legion's length \nDeploys its cohorts, and the column stands \nIn open plain, the ranks of battle set, \nAnd far and near with rippling sheen of arms \nThe wide earth flickers, nor yet in grisly strife \nFoe grapples foe, but dubious 'twixt the hosts \nThe war-god wavers; so let all be ranged \nIn equal rows symmetric, not alone \nTo feed an idle fancy with the view, \nBut since not otherwise will earth afford \nVigour to all alike, nor yet the boughs \nHave power to stretch them into open space. \nShouldst haply of the furrow's depth inquire, \nEven to a shallow trench I dare commit \nThe vine; but deeper in the ground is fixed \nThe tree that props it, aesculus in chief, \nWhich howso far its summit soars toward heaven, \nSo deep strikes root into the vaults of hell. \nIt therefore neither storms, nor blasts, nor showers \nWrench from its bed; unshaken it abides, \nSees many a generation, many an age \nOf men roll onward, and survives them all, \nStretching its titan arms and branches far, \nSole central pillar of a world of shade. \nNor toward the sunset let thy vineyards slope, \nNor midst the vines plant hazel; neither take \nThe topmost shoots for cuttings, nor from the top \nOf the supporting tree your suckers tear; \nSo deep their love of earth; nor wound the plants \nWith blunted blade; nor truncheons intersperse \nOf the wild olive: for oft from careless swains \nA spark hath fallen, that, 'neath the unctuous rind \nHid thief-like first, now grips the tough tree-bole, \nAnd mounting to the leaves on high, sends forth \nA roar to heaven, then coursing through the boughs \nAnd airy summits reigns victoriously, \nWraps all the grove in robes of fire, and gross \nWith pitch-black vapour heaves the murky reek \nSkyward, but chiefly if a storm has swooped \nDown on the forest, and a driving wind \nRolls up the conflagration. When 'tis so, \nTheir root-force fails them, nor, when lopped away, \nCan they recover, and from the earth beneath \nSpring to like verdure; thus alone survives \nThe bare wild olive with its bitter leaves. \nLet none persuade thee, howso weighty-wise, \nTo stir the soil when stiff with Boreas' breath. \nThen ice-bound winter locks the fields, nor lets \nThe young plant fix its frozen root to earth. \nBest sow your vineyards when in blushing Spring \nComes the white bird long-bodied snakes abhor, \nOr on the eve of autumn's earliest frost, \nEre the swift sun-steeds touch the wintry Signs, \nWhile summer is departing. Spring it is \nBlesses the fruit-plantation, Spring the groves; \nIn Spring earth swells and claims the fruitful seed. \nThen Aether, sire omnipotent, leaps down \nWith quickening showers to his glad wife's embrace, \nAnd, might with might commingling, rears to life \nAll germs that teem within her; then resound \nWith songs of birds the greenwood-wildernesses, \nAnd in due time the herds their loves renew; \nThen the boon earth yields increase, and the fields \nUnlock their bosoms to the warm west winds; \nSoft moisture spreads o'er all things, and the blades \nFace the new suns, and safely trust them now; \nThe vine-shoot, fearless of the rising south, \nOr mighty north winds driving rain from heaven, \nBursts into bud, and every leaf unfolds. \nEven so, methinks, when Earth to being sprang, \nDawned the first days, and such the course they held; \n'Twas Spring-tide then, ay, Spring, the mighty world \nWas keeping: Eurus spared his wintry blasts, \nWhen first the flocks drank sunlight, and a race \nOf men like iron from the hard glebe arose, \nAnd wild beasts thronged the woods, and stars the heaven.\n\nNor could frail creatures bear this heavy strain, \nDid not so large a respite interpose \n'Twixt frost and heat, and heaven's relenting arms \nYield earth a welcome. \n\nFor the rest, whate'er \nThe sets thou plantest in thy fields, thereon \nStrew refuse rich, and with abundant earth \nTake heed to hide them, and dig in withal \nRough shells or porous stone, for therebetween \nWill water trickle and fine vapour creep, \nAnd so the plants their drooping spirits raise. \nAye, and there have been, who with weight of stone \nOr heavy potsherd press them from above; \nThis serves for shield in pelting showers, and this \nWhen the hot dog-star chaps the fields with drought. \nThe slips once planted, yet remains to cleave \nThe earth about their roots persistently, \nAnd toss the cumbrous hoes, or task the soil \nWith burrowing plough-share, and ply up and down \nYour labouring bullocks through the vineyard's midst, \nThen too smooth reeds and shafts of whittled wand, \nAnd ashen poles and sturdy forks to shape, \nWhereby supported they may learn to mount, \nLaugh at the gales, and through the elm-tops win \nFrom story up to story. \n\nNow while yet \nThe leaves are in their first fresh infant growth, \nForbear their frailty, and while yet the bough \nShoots joyfully toward heaven, with loosened rein \nLaunched on the void, assail it not as yet \nWith keen-edged sickle, but let the leaves alone \nBe culled with clip of fingers here and there. \nBut when they clasp the elms with sturdy trunks \nErect, then strip the leaves off, prune the boughs; \nSooner they shrink from steel, but then put forth \nThe arm of power, and stem the branchy tide. \nHedges too must be woven and all beasts \nBarred entrance, chiefly while the leaf is young \nAnd witless of disaster; for therewith, \nBeside harsh winters and o'erpowering sun, \nWild buffaloes and pestering goats for ay \nBesport them, sheep and heifers glut their greed. \nNor cold by hoar-frost curdled, nor the prone \nDead weight of summer upon the parched crags, \nSo scathe it, as the flocks with venom-bite \nOf their hard tooth, whose gnawing scars the stem. \nFor no offence but this to Bacchus bleeds \nThe goat at every altar, and old plays \nUpon the stage find entrance; therefore too \nThe sons of Theseus through the country-side- \nHamlet and crossway- set the prize of wit, \nAnd on the smooth sward over oiled skins \nDance in their tipsy frolic. Furthermore \nThe Ausonian swains, a race from Troy derived, \nMake merry with rough rhymes and boisterous mirth, \nGrim masks of hollowed bark assume, invoke \nThee with glad hymns, O Bacchus, and to thee \nHang puppet-faces on tall pines to swing. \nHence every vineyard teems with mellowing fruit, \nTill hollow vale o'erflows, and gorge profound, \nWhere'er the god hath turned his comely head. \nTherefore to Bacchus duly will we sing \nMeet honour with ancestral hymns, and cates \nAnd dishes bear him; and the doomed goat \nLed by the horn shall at the altar stand, \nWhose entrails rich on hazel-spits we'll roast. \nThis further task again, to dress the vine, \nHath needs beyond exhausting; the whole soil \nThrice, four times, yearly must be cleft, the sod \nWith hoes reversed be crushed continually, \nThe whole plantation lightened of its leaves. \nRound on the labourer spins the wheel of toil, \nAs on its own track rolls the circling year. \nSoon as the vine her lingering leaves hath shed, \nAnd the chill north wind from the forests shook \nTheir coronal, even then the careful swain \nLooks keenly forward to the coming year, \nWith Saturn's curved fang pursues and prunes \nThe vine forlorn, and lops it into shape. \nBe first to dig the ground up, first to clear \nAnd burn the refuse-branches, first to house \nAgain your vine-poles, last to gather fruit. \nTwice doth the thickening shade beset the vine, \nTwice weeds with stifling briers o'ergrow the crop; \nAnd each a toilsome labour. Do thou praise \nBroad acres, farm but few. Rough twigs beside \nOf butcher's broom among the woods are cut, \nAnd reeds upon the river-banks, and still \nThe undressed willow claims thy fostering care. \nSo now the vines are fettered, now the trees \nLet go the sickle, and the last dresser now \nSings of his finished rows; but still the ground \nMust vexed be, the dust be stirred, and heaven \nStill set thee trembling for the ripened grapes. \nNot so with olives; small husbandry need they, \nNor look for sickle bowed or biting rake, \nWhen once they have gripped the soil, and borne the breeze.\n\nEarth of herself, with hooked fang laid bare, \nYields moisture for the plants, and heavy fruit, \nThe ploughshare aiding; therewithal thou'lt rear \nThe olive's fatness well-beloved of Peace. \nApples, moreover, soon as first they feel \nTheir stems wax lusty, and have found their strength, \nTo heaven climb swiftly, self-impelled, nor crave \nOur succour. All the grove meanwhile no less \nWith fruit is swelling, and the wild haunts of birds \nBlush with their blood-red berries. Cytisus \nIs good to browse on, the tall forest yields \nPine-torches, and the nightly fires are fed \nAnd shoot forth radiance. And shall men be loath \nTo plant, nor lavish of their pains? Why trace \nThings mightier? Willows even and lowly brooms \nTo cattle their green leaves, to shepherds shade, \nFences for crops, and food for honey yield. \nAnd blithe it is Cytorus to behold \nWaving with box, Narycian groves of pitch; \nOh! blithe the sight of fields beholden not \nTo rake or man's endeavour! the barren woods \nThat crown the scalp of Caucasus, even these, \nWhich furious blasts for ever rive and rend, \nYield various wealth, pine-logs that serve for ships, \nCedar and cypress for the homes of men; \nHence, too, the farmers shave their wheel-spokes, hence \nDrums for their wains, and curved boat-keels fit; \nWillows bear twigs enow, the elm-tree leaves, \nMyrtle stout spear-shafts, war-tried cornel too; \nYews into Ituraean bows are bent: \nNor do smooth lindens or lathe-polished box \nShrink from man's shaping and keen-furrowing steel; \nLight alder floats upon the boiling flood \nSped down the Padus, and bees house their swarms \nIn rotten holm-oak's hollow bark and bole. \nWhat of like praise can Bacchus' gifts afford? \nNay, Bacchus even to crime hath prompted, he \nThe wine-infuriate Centaurs quelled with death, \nRhoetus and Pholus, and with mighty bowl \nHylaeus threatening high the Lapithae. \nOh! all too happy tillers of the soil, \nCould they but know their blessedness, for whom \nFar from the clash of arms all-equal earth \nPours from the ground herself their easy fare! \nWhat though no lofty palace portal-proud \nFrom all its chambers vomits forth a tide \nOf morning courtiers, nor agape they gaze \nOn pillars with fair tortoise-shell inwrought, \nGold-purfled robes, and bronze from Ephyre; \nNor is the whiteness of their wool distained \nWith drugs Assyrian, nor clear olive's use \nWith cassia tainted; yet untroubled calm, \nA life that knows no falsehood, rich enow \nWith various treasures, yet broad-acred ease, \nGrottoes and living lakes, yet Tempes cool, \nLowing of kine, and sylvan slumbers soft, \nThey lack not; lawns and wild beasts' haunts are there, \nA youth of labour patient, need-inured, \nWorship, and reverend sires: with them from earth \nDeparting justice her last footprints left. \nMe before all things may the Muses sweet, \nWhose rites I bear with mighty passion pierced, \nReceive, and show the paths and stars of heaven, \nThe sun's eclipses and the labouring moons, \nFrom whence the earthquake, by what power the seas \nSwell from their depths, and, every barrier burst, \nSink back upon themselves, why winter-suns \nSo haste to dip 'neath ocean, or what check \nThe lingering night retards. But if to these \nHigh realms of nature the cold curdling blood \nAbout my heart bar access, then be fields \nAnd stream-washed vales my solace, let me love \nRivers and woods, inglorious. Oh for you \nPlains, and Spercheius, and Taygete, \nBy Spartan maids o'er-revelled! Oh, for one, \nWould set me in deep dells of Haemus cool, \nAnd shield me with his boughs' o'ershadowing might! \nHappy, who had the skill to understand \nNature's hid causes, and beneath his feet \nAll terrors cast, and death's relentless doom, \nAnd the loud roar of greedy Acheron. \nBlest too is he who knows the rural gods, \nPan, old Silvanus, and the sister-nymphs! \nHim nor the rods of public power can bend, \nNor kingly purple, nor fierce feud that drives \nBrother to turn on brother, nor descent \nOf Dacian from the Danube's leagued flood, \nNor Rome's great State, nor kingdoms like to die; \nNor hath he grieved through pitying of the poor, \nNor envied him that hath. What fruit the boughs, \nAnd what the fields, of their own bounteous will \nHave borne, he gathers; nor iron rule of laws, \nNor maddened Forum have his eyes beheld, \nNor archives of the people. Others vex \nThe darksome gulfs of Ocean with their oars, \nOr rush on steel: they press within the courts \nAnd doors of princes; one with havoc falls \nUpon a city and its hapless hearths, \nFrom gems to drink, on Tyrian rugs to lie; \nThis hoards his wealth and broods o'er buried gold; \nOne at the rostra stares in blank amaze; \nOne gaping sits transported by the cheers, \nThe answering cheers of plebs and senate rolled \nAlong the benches: bathed in brothers' blood \nMen revel, and, all delights of hearth and home \nFor exile changing, a new country seek \nBeneath an alien sun. The husbandman \nWith hooked ploughshare turns the soil; from hence \nSprings his year's labour; hence, too, he sustains \nCountry and cottage homestead, and from hence \nHis herds of cattle and deserving steers. \nNo respite! still the year o'erflows with fruit, \nOr young of kine, or Ceres' wheaten sheaf, \nWith crops the furrow loads, and bursts the barns. \nWinter is come: in olive-mills they bruise \nThe Sicyonian berry; acorn-cheered \nThe swine troop homeward; woods their arbutes yield; \nSo, various fruit sheds Autumn, and high up \nOn sunny rocks the mellowing vintage bakes. \nMeanwhile about his lips sweet children cling; \nHis chaste house keeps its purity; his kine \nDrop milky udders, and on the lush green grass \nFat kids are striving, horn to butting horn. \nHimself keeps holy days; stretched o'er the sward, \nWhere round the fire his comrades crown the bowl, \nHe pours libation, and thy name invokes, \nLenaeus, and for the herdsmen on an elm \nSets up a mark for the swift javelin; they \nStrip their tough bodies for the rustic sport. \nSuch life of yore the ancient Sabines led, \nSuch Remus and his brother: Etruria thus, \nDoubt not, to greatness grew, and Rome became \nThe fair world's fairest, and with circling wall \nClasped to her single breast the sevenfold hills. \nAy, ere the reign of Dicte's king, ere men, \nWaxed godless, banqueted on slaughtered bulls, \nSuch life on earth did golden Saturn lead. \nNor ear of man had heard the war-trump's blast, \nNor clang of sword on stubborn anvil set. \nBut lo! a boundless space we have travelled o'er; \n'Tis time our steaming horses to unyoke. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGEORGIC III\n\nThee too, great Pales, will I hymn, and thee, \nAmphrysian shepherd, worthy to be sung, \nYou, woods and waves Lycaean. All themes beside, \nWhich else had charmed the vacant mind with song, \nAre now waxed common. Of harsh Eurystheus who \nThe story knows not, or that praiseless king \nBusiris, and his altars? or by whom \nHath not the tale been told of Hylas young, \nLatonian Delos and Hippodame, \nAnd Pelops for his ivory shoulder famed, \nKeen charioteer? Needs must a path be tried, \nBy which I too may lift me from the dust, \nAnd float triumphant through the mouths of men. \nYea, I shall be the first, so life endure, \nTo lead the Muses with me, as I pass \nTo mine own country from the Aonian height; \nI, Mantua, first will bring thee back the palms \nOf Idumaea, and raise a marble shrine \nOn thy green plain fast by the water-side, \nWhere Mincius winds more vast in lazy coils, \nAnd rims his margent with the tender reed. \nAmid my shrine shall Caesar's godhead dwell. \nTo him will I, as victor, bravely dight \nIn Tyrian purple, drive along the bank \nA hundred four-horse cars. All Greece for me, \nLeaving Alpheus and Molorchus' grove, \nOn foot shall strive, or with the raw-hide glove; \nWhilst I, my head with stripped green olive crowned, \nWill offer gifts. Even 'tis present joy \nTo lead the high processions to the fane, \nAnd view the victims felled; or how the scene \nSunders with shifted face, and Britain's sons \nInwoven thereon with those proud curtains rise. \nOf gold and massive ivory on the doors \nI'll trace the battle of the Gangarides, \nAnd our Quirinus' conquering arms, and there \nSurging with war, and hugely flowing, the Nile, \nAnd columns heaped on high with naval brass. \nAnd Asia's vanquished cities I will add, \nAnd quelled Niphates, and the Parthian foe, \nWho trusts in flight and backward-volleying darts, \nAnd trophies torn with twice triumphant hand \nFrom empires twain on ocean's either shore. \nAnd breathing forms of Parian marble there \nShall stand, the offspring of Assaracus, \nAnd great names of the Jove-descended folk, \nAnd father Tros, and Troy's first founder, lord \nOf Cynthus. And accursed Envy there \nShall dread the Furies, and thy ruthless flood, \nCocytus, and Ixion's twisted snakes, \nAnd that vast wheel and ever-baffling stone. \nMeanwhile the Dryad-haunted woods and lawns \nUnsullied seek we; 'tis thy hard behest, \nMaecenas. Without thee no lofty task \nMy mind essays. Up! break the sluggish bonds \nOf tarriance; with loud din Cithaeron calls, \nSteed-taming Epidaurus, and thy hounds, \nTaygete; and hark! the assenting groves \nWith peal on peal reverberate the roar. \nYet must I gird me to rehearse ere long \nThe fiery fights of Caesar, speed his name \nThrough ages, countless as to Caesar's self \nFrom the first birth-dawn of Tithonus old. \nIf eager for the prized Olympian palm \nOne breed the horse, or bullock strong to plough, \nBe his prime care a shapely dam to choose. \nOf kine grim-faced is goodliest, with coarse head \nAnd burly neck, whose hanging dewlaps reach \nFrom chin to knee; of boundless length her flank; \nLarge every way she is, large-footed even, \nWith incurved horns and shaggy ears beneath. \nNor let mislike me one with spots of white \nConspicuous, or that spurns the yoke, whose horn \nAt times hath vice in't: liker bull-faced she, \nAnd tall-limbed wholly, and with tip of tail \nBrushing her footsteps as she walks along. \nThe age for Hymen's rites, Lucina's pangs, \nEre ten years ended, after four begins; \nTheir residue of days nor apt to teem, \nNor strong for ploughing. Meantime, while youth's delight\n\nSurvives within them, loose the males: be first \nTo speed thy herds of cattle to their loves, \nBreed stock with stock, and keep the race supplied. \nAh! life's best hours are ever first to fly \nFrom hapless mortals; in their place succeed \nDisease and dolorous eld; till travail sore \nAnd death unpitying sweep them from the scene. \nStill will be some, whose form thou fain wouldst change;\n\nRenew them still; with yearly choice of young \nPreventing losses, lest too late thou rue. \nNor steeds crave less selection; but on those \nThou think'st to rear, the promise of their line, \nFrom earliest youth thy chiefest pains bestow. \nSee from the first yon high-bred colt afield, \nHis lofty step, his limbs' elastic tread: \nDauntless he leads the herd, still first to try \nThe threatening flood, or brave the unknown bridge, \nBy no vain noise affrighted; lofty-necked, \nWith clean-cut head, short belly, and stout back; \nHis sprightly breast exuberant with brawn. \nChestnut and grey are good; the worst-hued white \nAnd sorrel. Then lo! if arms are clashed afar, \nBide still he cannot: ears stiffen and limbs quake; \nHis nostrils snort and roll out wreaths of fire. \nDense is his mane, that when uplifted falls \nOn his right shoulder; betwixt either loin \nThe spine runs double; his earth-dinting hoof \nRings with the ponderous beat of solid horn. \nEven such a horse was Cyllarus, reined and tamed \nBy Pollux of Amyclae; such the pair \nIn Grecian song renowned, those steeds of Mars, \nAnd famed Achilles' team: in such-like form \nGreat Saturn's self with mane flung loose on neck \nSped at his wife's approach, and flying filled \nThe heights of Pelion with his piercing neigh. \nEven him, when sore disease or sluggish eld \nNow saps his strength, pen fast at home, and spare \nHis not inglorious age. A horse grown old \nSlow kindling unto love in vain prolongs \nThe fruitless task, and, to the encounter come, \nAs fire in stubble blusters without strength, \nHe rages idly. Therefore mark thou first \nTheir age and mettle, other points anon, \nAs breed and lineage, or what pain was theirs \nTo lose the race, what pride the palm to win. \nSeest how the chariots in mad rivalry \nPoured from the barrier grip the course and go, \nWhen youthful hope is highest, and every heart \nDrained with each wild pulsation? How they ply \nThe circling lash, and reaching forward let \nThe reins hang free! Swift spins the glowing wheel; \nAnd now they stoop, and now erect in air \nSeem borne through space and towering to the sky: \nNo stop, no stay; the dun sand whirls aloft; \nThey reek with foam-flakes and pursuing breath; \nSo sweet is fame, so prized the victor's palm. \n'Twas Ericthonius first took heart to yoke \nFour horses to his car, and rode above \nThe whirling wheels to victory: but the ring \nAnd bridle-reins, mounted on horses' backs, \nThe Pelethronian Lapithae bequeathed, \nAnd taught the knight in arms to spurn the ground, \nAnd arch the upgathered footsteps of his pride. \nEach task alike is arduous, and for each \nA horse young, fiery, swift of foot, they seek; \nHow oft so-e'er yon rival may have chased \nThe flying foe, or boast his native plain \nEpirus, or Mycenae's stubborn hold, \nAnd trace his lineage back to Neptune's birth. \nThese points regarded, as the time draws nigh, \nWith instant zeal they lavish all their care \nTo plump with solid fat the chosen chief \nAnd designated husband of the herd: \nAnd flowery herbs they cut, and serve him well \nWith corn and running water, that his strength \nNot fail him for that labour of delight, \nNor puny colts betray the feeble sire. \nThe herd itself of purpose they reduce \nTo leanness, and when love's sweet longing first \nProvokes them, they forbid the leafy food, \nAnd pen them from the springs, and oft beside \nWith running shake, and tire them in the sun, \nWhat time the threshing-floor groans heavily \nWith pounding of the corn-ears, and light chaff \nIs whirled on high to catch the rising west. \nThis do they that the soil's prolific powers \nMay not be dulled by surfeiting, nor choke \nThe sluggish furrows, but eagerly absorb \nTheir fill of love, and deeply entertain. \nTo care of sire the mother's care succeeds. \nWhen great with young they wander nigh their time, \nLet no man suffer them to drag the yoke \nIn heavy wains, nor leap across the way, \nNor scour the meads, nor swim the rushing flood. \nIn lonely lawns they feed them, by the course \nOf brimming streams, where moss is, and the banks \nWith grass are greenest, where are sheltering caves, \nAnd far outstretched the rock-flung shadow lies. \nRound wooded Silarus and the ilex-bowers \nOf green Alburnus swarms a winged pest- \nIts Roman name Asilus, by the Greeks \nTermed Oestros- fierce it is, and harshly hums, \nDriving whole herds in terror through the groves, \nTill heaven is madded by their bellowing din, \nAnd Tanager's dry bed and forest-banks. \nWith this same scourge did Juno wreak of old \nThe terrors of her wrath, a plague devised \nAgainst the heifer sprung from Inachus. \nFrom this too thou, since in the noontide heats \n'Tis most persistent, fend thy teeming herds, \nAnd feed them when the sun is newly risen, \nOr the first stars are ushering in the night. \nBut, yeaning ended, all their tender care \nIs to the calves transferred; at once with marks \nThey brand them, both to designate their race, \nAnd which to rear for breeding, or devote \nAs altar-victims, or to cleave the ground \nAnd into ridges tear and turn the sod. \nThe rest along the greensward graze at will. \nThose that to rustic uses thou wouldst mould, \nAs calves encourage and take steps to tame, \nWhile pliant wills and plastic youth allow. \nAnd first of slender withies round the throat \nLoose collars hang, then when their free-born necks \nAre used to service, with the self-same bands \nYoke them in pairs, and steer by steer compel \nKeep pace together. And time it is that oft \nUnfreighted wheels be drawn along the ground \nBehind them, as to dint the surface-dust; \nThen let the beechen axle strain and creak \n'Neath some stout burden, whilst a brazen pole \nDrags on the wheels made fast thereto. Meanwhile \nFor their unbroken youth not grass alone, \nNor meagre willow-leaves and marish-sedge, \nBut corn-ears with thy hand pluck from the crops. \nNor shall the brood-kine, as of yore, for thee \nBrim high the snowy milking-pail, but spend \nTheir udders' fullness on their own sweet young. \nBut if fierce squadrons and the ranks of war \nDelight thee rather, or on wheels to glide \nAt Pisa, with Alpheus fleeting by, \nAnd in the grove of Jupiter urge on \nThe flying chariot, be your steed's first task \nTo face the warrior's armed rage, and brook \nThe trumpet, and long roar of rumbling wheels, \nAnd clink of chiming bridles in the stall; \nThen more and more to love his master's voice \nCaressing, or loud hand that claps his neck. \nAy, thus far let him learn to dare, when first \nWeaned from his mother, and his mouth at times \nYield to the supple halter, even while yet \nWeak, tottering-limbed, and ignorant of life. \nBut, three years ended, when the fourth arrives, \nNow let him tarry not to run the ring \nWith rhythmic hoof-beat echoing, and now learn \nAlternately to curve each bending leg, \nAnd be like one that struggleth; then at last \nChallenge the winds to race him, and at speed \nLaunched through the open, like a reinless thing, \nScarce print his footsteps on the surface-sand. \nAs when with power from Hyperborean climes \nThe north wind stoops, and scatters from his path \nDry clouds and storms of Scythia; the tall corn \nAnd rippling plains 'gin shiver with light gusts; \nA sound is heard among the forest-tops; \nLong waves come racing shoreward: fast he flies, \nWith instant pinion sweeping earth and main. \nA steed like this or on the mighty course \nOf Elis at the goal will sweat, and shower \nRed foam-flakes from his mouth, or, kindlier task, \nWith patient neck support the Belgian car. \nThen, broken at last, let swell their burly frame \nWith fattening corn-mash, for, unbroke, they will \nWith pride wax wanton, and, when caught, refuse \nTough lash to brook or jagged curb obey. \nBut no device so fortifies their power \nAs love's blind stings of passion to forefend, \nWhether on steed or steer thy choice be set. \nAy, therefore 'tis they banish bulls afar \nTo solitary pastures, or behind \nSome mountain-barrier, or broad streams beyond, \nOr else in plenteous stalls pen fast at home. \nFor, even through sight of her, the female wastes \nHis strength with smouldering fire, till he forget \nBoth grass and woodland. She indeed full oft \nWith her sweet charms can lovers proud compel \nTo battle for the conquest horn to horn. \nIn Sila's forest feeds the heifer fair, \nWhile each on each the furious rivals run; \nWound follows wound; the black blood laves their limbs; \nHorns push and strive against opposing horns, \nWith mighty groaning; all the forest-side \nAnd far Olympus bellow back the roar. \nNor wont the champions in one stall to couch; \nBut he that's worsted hies him to strange climes \nFar off, an exile, moaning much the shame, \nThe blows of that proud conqueror, then love's loss \nAvenged not; with one glance toward the byre, \nHis ancient royalties behind him lie. \nSo with all heed his strength he practiseth, \nAnd nightlong makes the hard bare stones his bed, \nAnd feeds on prickly leaf and pointed rush, \nAnd proves himself, and butting at a tree \nLearns to fling wrath into his horns, with blows \nProvokes the air, and scattering clouds of sand \nMakes prelude of the battle; afterward, \nWith strength repaired and gathered might breaks camp, \nAnd hurls him headlong on the unthinking foe: \nAs in mid ocean when a wave far of \nBegins to whiten, mustering from the main \nIts rounded breast, and, onward rolled to land \nFalls with prodigious roar among the rocks, \nHuge as a very mountain: but the depths \nUpseethe in swirling eddies, and disgorge \nThe murky sand-lees from their sunken bed. \nNay, every race on earth of men, and beasts, \nAnd ocean-folk, and flocks, and painted birds, \nRush to the raging fire: love sways them all. \nNever than then more fiercely o'er the plain \nProwls heedless of her whelps the lioness: \nNor monstrous bears such wide-spread havoc-doom \nDeal through the forests; then the boar is fierce, \nMost deadly then the tigress: then, alack! \nIll roaming is it on Libya's lonely plains. \nMark you what shivering thrills the horse's frame, \nIf but a waft the well-known gust conveys? \nNor curb can check them then, nor lash severe, \nNor rocks and caverned crags, nor barrier-floods, \nThat rend and whirl and wash the hills away. \nThen speeds amain the great Sabellian boar, \nHis tushes whets, with forefoot tears the ground, \nRubs 'gainst a tree his flanks, and to and fro \nHardens each wallowing shoulder to the wound. \nWhat of the youth, when love's relentless might \nStirs the fierce fire within his veins? Behold! \nIn blindest midnight how he swims the gulf \nConvulsed with bursting storm-clouds! Over him \nHeaven's huge gate thunders; the rock-shattered main \nUtters a warning cry; nor parents' tears \nCan backward call him, nor the maid he loves, \nToo soon to die on his untimely pyre. \nWhat of the spotted ounce to Bacchus dear, \nOr warlike wolf-kin or the breed of dogs? \nWhy tell how timorous stags the battle join? \nO'er all conspicuous is the rage of mares, \nBy Venus' self inspired of old, what time \nThe Potnian four with rending jaws devoured \nThe limbs of Glaucus. Love-constrained they roam \nPast Gargarus, past the loud Ascanian flood; \nThey climb the mountains, and the torrents swim; \nAnd when their eager marrow first conceives \nThe fire, in Spring-tide chiefly, for with Spring \nWarmth doth their frames revisit, then they stand \nAll facing westward on the rocky heights, \nAnd of the gentle breezes take their fill; \nAnd oft unmated, marvellous to tell, \nBut of the wind impregnate, far and wide \nO'er craggy height and lowly vale they scud, \nNot toward thy rising, Eurus, or the sun's, \nBut westward and north-west, or whence up-springs \nBlack Auster, that glooms heaven with rainy cold. \nHence from their groin slow drips a poisonous juice, \nBy shepherds truly named hippomanes, \nHippomanes, fell stepdames oft have culled, \nAnd mixed with herbs and spells of baneful bode. \nFast flies meanwhile the irreparable hour, \nAs point to point our charmed round we trace. \nEnough of herds. This second task remains, \nThe wool-clad flocks and shaggy goats to treat. \nHere lies a labour; hence for glory look, \nBrave husbandmen. Nor doubtfully know \nHow hard it is for words to triumph here, \nAnd shed their lustre on a theme so slight: \nBut I am caught by ravishing desire \nAbove the lone Parnassian steep; I love \nTo walk the heights, from whence no earlier track \nSlopes gently downward to Castalia's spring. \nNow, awful Pales, strike a louder tone. \nFirst, for the sheep soft pencotes I decree \nTo browse in, till green summer's swift return; \nAnd that the hard earth under them with straw \nAnd handfuls of the fern be littered deep, \nLest chill of ice such tender cattle harm \nWith scab and loathly foot-rot. Passing thence \nI bid the goats with arbute-leaves be stored, \nAnd served with fresh spring-water, and their pens \nTurned southward from the blast, to face the suns \nOf winter, when Aquarius' icy beam \nNow sinks in showers upon the parting year. \nThese too no lightlier our protection claim, \nNor prove of poorer service, howsoe'er \nMilesian fleeces dipped in Tyrian reds \nRepay the barterer; these with offspring teem \nMore numerous; these yield plenteous store of milk: \nThe more each dry-wrung udder froths the pail, \nMore copious soon the teat-pressed torrents flow. \nAy, and on Cinyps' bank the he-goats too \nTheir beards and grizzled chins and bristling hair \nLet clip for camp-use, or as rugs to wrap \nSeafaring wretches. But they browse the woods \nAnd summits of Lycaeus, and rough briers, \nAnd brakes that love the highland: of themselves \nRight heedfully the she-goats homeward troop \nBefore their kids, and with plump udders clogged \nScarce cross the threshold. Wherefore rather ye, \nThe less they crave man's vigilance, be fain \nFrom ice to fend them and from snowy winds; \nBring food and feast them with their branchy fare, \nNor lock your hay-loft all the winter long. \nBut when glad summer at the west wind's call \nSends either flock to pasture in the glades, \nSoon as the day-star shineth, hie we then \nTo the cool meadows, while the dawn is young, \nThe grass yet hoary, and to browsing herds \nThe dew tastes sweetest on the tender sward. \nWhen heaven's fourth hour draws on the thickening drought,\n\nAnd shrill cicalas pierce the brake with song, \nThen at the well-springs bid them, or deep pools, \nFrom troughs of holm-oak quaff the running wave: \nBut at day's hottest seek a shadowy vale, \nWhere some vast ancient-timbered oak of Jove \nSpreads his huge branches, or where huddling black \nIlex on ilex cowers in awful shade. \nThen once more give them water sparingly, \nAnd feed once more, till sunset, when cool eve \nAllays the air, and dewy moonbeams slake \nThe forest glades, with halcyon's song the shore, \nAnd every thicket with the goldfinch rings. \nOf Libya's shepherds why the tale pursue? \nWhy sing their pastures and the scattered huts \nThey house in? Oft their cattle day and night \nGraze the whole month together, and go forth \nInto far deserts where no shelter is, \nSo flat the plain and boundless. All his goods \nThe Afric swain bears with him, house and home, \nArms, Cretan quiver, and Amyclaean dog; \nAs some keen Roman in his country's arms \nPlies the swift march beneath a cruel load; \nSoon with tents pitched and at his post he stands, \nEre looked for by the foe. Not thus the tribes \nOf Scythia by the far Maeotic wave, \nWhere turbid Ister whirls his yellow sands, \nAnd Rhodope stretched out beneath the pole \nComes trending backward. There the herds they keep \nClose-pent in byres, nor any grass is seen \nUpon the plain, nor leaves upon the tree: \nBut with snow-ridges and deep frost afar \nHeaped seven ells high the earth lies featureless: \nStill winter? still the north wind's icy breath! \nNay, never sun disparts the shadows pale, \nOr as he rides the steep of heaven, or dips \nIn ocean's fiery bath his plunging car. \nQuick ice-crusts curdle on the running stream, \nAnd iron-hooped wheels the water's back now bears, \nTo broad wains opened, as erewhile to ships; \nBrass vessels oft asunder burst, and clothes \nStiffen upon the wearers; juicy wines \nThey cleave with axes; to one frozen mass \nWhole pools are turned; and on their untrimmed beards \nStiff clings the jagged icicle. Meanwhile \nAll heaven no less is filled with falling snow; \nThe cattle perish: oxen's mighty frames \nStand island-like amid the frost, and stags \nIn huddling herds, by that strange weight benumbed, \nScarce top the surface with their antler-points. \nThese with no hounds they hunt, nor net with toils, \nNor scare with terror of the crimson plume; \nBut, as in vain they breast the opposing block, \nButcher them, knife in hand, and so dispatch \nLoud-bellowing, and with glad shouts hale them home. \nThemselves in deep-dug caverns underground \nDwell free and careless; to their hearths they heave \nOak-logs and elm-trees whole, and fire them there, \nThere play the night out, and in festive glee \nWith barm and service sour the wine-cup mock. \nSo 'neath the seven-starred Hyperborean wain \nThe folk live tameless, buffeted with blasts \nOf Eurus from Rhipaean hills, and wrap \nTheir bodies in the tawny fells of beasts. \nIf wool delight thee, first, be far removed \nAll prickly boskage, burrs and caltrops; shun \nLuxuriant pastures; at the outset choose \nWhite flocks with downy fleeces. For the ram, \nHow white soe'er himself, be but the tongue \n'Neath his moist palate black, reject him, lest \nHe sully with dark spots his offspring's fleece, \nAnd seek some other o'er the teeming plain. \nEven with such snowy bribe of wool, if ear \nMay trust the tale, Pan, God of Arcady, \nSnared and beguiled thee, Luna, calling thee \nTo the deep woods; nor thou didst spurn his call. \nBut who for milk hath longing, must himself \nCarry lucerne and lotus-leaves enow \nWith salt herbs to the cote, whence more they love \nThe streams, more stretch their udders, and give back \nA subtle taste of saltness in the milk. \nMany there be who from their mothers keep \nThe new-born kids, and straightway bind their mouths \nWith iron-tipped muzzles. What they milk at dawn, \nOr in the daylight hours, at night they press; \nWhat darkling or at sunset, this ere morn \nThey bear away in baskets- for to town \nThe shepherd hies him- or with dash of salt \nJust sprinkle, and lay by for winter use. \nNor be thy dogs last cared for; but alike \nSwift Spartan hounds and fierce Molossian feed \nOn fattening whey. Never, with these to watch, \nDread nightly thief afold and ravening wolves, \nOr Spanish desperadoes in the rear. \nAnd oft the shy wild asses thou wilt chase, \nWith hounds, too, hunt the hare, with hounds the doe; \nOft from his woodland wallowing-den uprouse \nThe boar, and scare him with their baying, and drive, \nAnd o'er the mountains urge into the toils \nSome antlered monster to their chiming cry. \nLearn also scented cedar-wood to burn \nWithin the stalls, and snakes of noxious smell \nWith fumes of galbanum to drive away. \nOft under long-neglected cribs, or lurks \nA viper ill to handle, that hath fled \nThe light in terror, or some snake, that wont \n'Neath shade and sheltering roof to creep, and shower \nIts bane among the cattle, hugs the ground, \nFell scourge of kine. Shepherd, seize stakes, seize stones!\n\nAnd as he rears defiance, and puffs out \nA hissing throat, down with him! see how low \nThat cowering crest is vailed in flight, the while, \nHis midmost coils and final sweep of tail \nRelaxing, the last fold drags lingering spires. \nThen that vile worm that in Calabrian glades \nUprears his breast, and wreathes a scaly back, \nHis length of belly pied with mighty spots- \nWhile from their founts gush any streams, while yet \nWith showers of Spring and rainy south-winds earth \nIs moistened, lo! he haunts the pools, and here \nHoused in the banks, with fish and chattering frogs \nCrams the black void of his insatiate maw. \nSoon as the fens are parched, and earth with heat \nIs gaping, forth he darts into the dry, \nRolls eyes of fire and rages through the fields, \nFurious from thirst and by the drought dismayed. \nMe list not then beneath the open heaven \nTo snatch soft slumber, nor on forest-ridge \nLie stretched along the grass, when, slipped his slough,\n\nTo glittering youth transformed he winds his spires, \nAnd eggs or younglings leaving in his lair, \nTowers sunward, lightening with three-forked tongue. \nOf sickness, too, the causes and the signs \nI'll teach thee. Loathly scab assails the sheep, \nWhen chilly showers have probed them to the quick, \nAnd winter stark with hoar-frost, or when sweat \nUnpurged cleaves to them after shearing done, \nAnd rough thorns rend their bodies. Hence it is \nShepherds their whole flock steep in running streams, \nWhile, plunged beneath the flood, with drenched fell, \nThe ram, launched free, goes drifting down the tide. \nElse, having shorn, they smear their bodies o'er \nWith acrid oil-lees, and mix silver-scum \nAnd native sulphur and Idaean pitch, \nWax mollified with ointment, and therewith \nSea-leek, strong hellebores, bitumen black. \nYet ne'er doth kindlier fortune crown his toil, \nThan if with blade of iron a man dare lance \nThe ulcer's mouth ope: for the taint is fed \nAnd quickened by confinement; while the swain \nHis hand of healing from the wound withholds, \nOr sits for happier signs imploring heaven. \nAye, and when inward to the bleater's bones \nThe pain hath sunk and rages, and their limbs \nBy thirsty fever are consumed, 'tis good \nTo draw the enkindled heat therefrom, and pierce \nWithin the hoof-clefts a blood-bounding vein. \nOf tribes Bisaltic such the wonted use, \nAnd keen Gelonian, when to Rhodope \nHe flies, or Getic desert, and quaffs milk \nWith horse-blood curdled. \n\nSeest one far afield \nOft to the shade's mild covert win, or pull \nThe grass tops listlessly, or hindmost lag, \nOr, browsing, cast her down amid the plain, \nAt night retire belated and alone; \nWith quick knife check the mischief, ere it creep \nWith dire contagion through the unwary herd. \nLess thick and fast the whirlwind scours the main \nWith tempest in its wake, than swarm the plagues \nOf cattle; nor seize they single lives alone, \nBut sudden clear whole feeding grounds, the flock \nWith all its promise, and extirpate the breed. \nWell would he trow it who, so long after, still \nHigh Alps and Noric hill-forts should behold, \nAnd Iapydian Timavus' fields, \nAy, still behold the shepherds' realms a waste, \nAnd far and wide the lawns untenanted. \nHere from distempered heavens erewhile arose \nA piteous season, with the full fierce heat \nOf autumn glowed, and cattle-kindreds all \nAnd all wild creatures to destruction gave, \nTainted the pools, the fodder charged with bane. \nNor simple was the way of death, but when \nHot thirst through every vein impelled had drawn \nTheir wretched limbs together, anon o'erflowed \nA watery flux, and all their bones piecemeal \nSapped by corruption to itself absorbed. \nOft in mid sacrifice to heaven- the white \nWool-woven fillet half wreathed about his brow- \nSome victim, standing by the altar, there \nBetwixt the loitering carles a-dying fell: \nOr, if betimes the slaughtering priest had struck, \nNor with its heaped entrails blazed the pile, \nNor seer to seeker thence could answer yield; \nNay, scarce the up-stabbing knife with blood was stained,\n\nScarce sullied with thin gore the surface-sand. \nHence die the calves in many a pasture fair, \nOr at full cribs their lives' sweet breath resign; \nHence on the fawning dog comes madness, hence \nRacks the sick swine a gasping cough that chokes \nWith swelling at the jaws: the conquering steed, \nUncrowned of effort and heedless of the sward, \nFaints, turns him from the springs, and paws the earth \nWith ceaseless hoof: low droop his ears, wherefrom \nBursts fitful sweat, a sweat that waxes cold \nUpon the dying beast; the skin is dry, \nAnd rigidly repels the handler's touch. \nThese earlier signs they give that presage doom. \nBut, if the advancing plague 'gin fiercer grow, \nThen are their eyes all fire, deep-drawn their breath, \nAt times groan-laboured: with long sobbing heave \nTheir lowest flanks; from either nostril streams \nBlack blood; a rough tongue clogs the obstructed jaws. \n'Twas helpful through inverted horn to pour \nDraughts of the wine-god down; sole way it seemed \nTo save the dying: soon this too proved their bane, \nAnd, reinvigorate but with frenzy's fire, \nEven at death's pinch- the gods some happier fate \nDeal to the just, such madness to their foes- \nEach with bared teeth his own limbs mangling tore. \nSee! as he smokes beneath the stubborn share, \nThe bull drops, vomiting foam-dabbled gore, \nAnd heaves his latest groans. Sad goes the swain, \nUnhooks the steer that mourns his fellow's fate, \nAnd in mid labour leaves the plough-gear fast. \nNor tall wood's shadow, nor soft sward may stir \nThat heart's emotion, nor rock-channelled flood, \nMore pure than amber speeding to the plain: \nBut see! his flanks fail under him, his eyes \nAre dulled with deadly torpor, and his neck \nSinks to the earth with drooping weight. What now \nBesteads him toil or service? to have turned \nThe heavy sod with ploughshare? And yet these \nNe'er knew the Massic wine-god's baneful boon, \nNor twice replenished banquets: but on leaves \nThey fare, and virgin grasses, and their cups \nAre crystal springs and streams with running tired, \nTheir healthful slumbers never broke by care. \nThen only, say they, through that country side \nFor Juno's rites were cattle far to seek, \nAnd ill-matched buffaloes the chariots drew \nTo their high fanes. So, painfully with rakes \nThey grub the soil, aye, with their very nails \nDig in the corn-seeds, and with strained neck \nO'er the high uplands drag the creaking wains. \nNo wolf for ambush pries about the pen, \nNor round the flock prowls nightly; pain more sharp \nSubdues him: the shy deer and fleet-foot stags \nWith hounds now wander by the haunts of men \nVast ocean's offspring, and all tribes that swim, \nOn the shore's confine the wave washes up, \nLike shipwrecked bodies: seals, unwonted there, \nFlee to the rivers. Now the viper dies, \nFor all his den's close winding, and with scales \nErect the astonied water-worms. The air \nBrooks not the very birds, that headlong fall, \nAnd leave their life beneath the soaring cloud. \nMoreover now nor change of fodder serves, \nAnd subtlest cures but injure; then were foiled \nThe masters, Chiron sprung from Phillyron, \nAnd Amythaon's son Melampus. See! \nFrom Stygian darkness launched into the light \nComes raging pale Tisiphone; she drives \nDisease and fear before her, day by day \nStill rearing higher that all-devouring head. \nWith bleat of flocks and lowings thick resound \nRivers and parched banks and sloping heights. \nAt last in crowds she slaughters them, she chokes \nThe very stalls with carrion-heaps that rot \nIn hideous corruption, till men learn \nWith earth to cover them, in pits to hide. \nFor e'en the fells are useless; nor the flesh \nWith water may they purge, or tame with fire, \nNor shear the fleeces even, gnawed through and through \nWith foul disease, nor touch the putrid webs; \nBut, had one dared the loathly weeds to try, \nRed blisters and an unclean sweat o'erran \nHis noisome limbs, till, no long tarriance made, \nThe fiery curse his tainted frame devoured. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGEORGIC IV\n\nOf air-born honey, gift of heaven, I now \nTake up the tale. Upon this theme no less \nLook thou, Maecenas, with indulgent eye. \nA marvellous display of puny powers, \nHigh-hearted chiefs, a nation's history, \nIts traits, its bent, its battles and its clans, \nAll, each, shall pass before you, while I sing. \nSlight though the poet's theme, not slight the praise, \nSo frown not heaven, and Phoebus hear his call. \nFirst find your bees a settled sure abode, \nWhere neither winds can enter (winds blow back \nThe foragers with food returning home) \nNor sheep and butting kids tread down the flowers, \nNor heifer wandering wide upon the plain \nDash off the dew, and bruise the springing blades. \nLet the gay lizard too keep far aloof \nHis scale-clad body from their honied stalls, \nAnd the bee-eater, and what birds beside, \nAnd Procne smirched with blood upon the breast \nFrom her own murderous hands. For these roam wide \nWasting all substance, or the bees themselves \nStrike flying, and in their beaks bear home, to glut \nThose savage nestlings with the dainty prey. \nBut let clear springs and moss-green pools be near, \nAnd through the grass a streamlet hurrying run, \nSome palm-tree o'er the porch extend its shade, \nOr huge-grown oleaster, that in Spring, \nTheir own sweet Spring-tide, when the new-made chiefs \nLead forth the young swarms, and, escaped their comb, \nThe colony comes forth to sport and play, \nThe neighbouring bank may lure them from the heat, \nOr bough befriend with hospitable shade. \nO'er the mid-waters, whether swift or still, \nCast willow-branches and big stones enow, \nBridge after bridge, where they may footing find \nAnd spread their wide wings to the summer sun, \nIf haply Eurus, swooping as they pause, \nHave dashed with spray or plunged them in the deep. \nAnd let green cassias and far-scented thymes, \nAnd savory with its heavy-laden breath \nBloom round about, and violet-beds hard by \nSip sweetness from the fertilizing springs. \nFor the hive's self, or stitched of hollow bark, \nOr from tough osier woven, let the doors \nBe strait of entrance; for stiff winter's cold \nCongeals the honey, and heat resolves and thaws, \nTo bees alike disastrous; not for naught \nSo haste they to cement the tiny pores \nThat pierce their walls, and fill the crevices \nWith pollen from the flowers, and glean and keep \nTo this same end the glue, that binds more fast \nThan bird-lime or the pitch from Ida's pines. \nOft too in burrowed holes, if fame be true, \nThey make their cosy subterranean home, \nAnd deeply lodged in hollow rocks are found, \nOr in the cavern of an age-hewn tree. \nThou not the less smear round their crannied cribs \nWith warm smooth mud-coat, and strew leaves above; \nBut near their home let neither yew-tree grow, \nNor reddening crabs be roasted, and mistrust \nDeep marish-ground and mire with noisome smell, \nOr where the hollow rocks sonorous ring, \nAnd the word spoken buffets and rebounds. \nWhat more? When now the golden sun has put \nWinter to headlong flight beneath the world, \nAnd oped the doors of heaven with summer ray, \nForthwith they roam the glades and forests o'er, \nRifle the painted flowers, or sip the streams, \nLight-hovering on the surface. Hence it is \nWith some sweet rapture, that we know not of, \nTheir little ones they foster, hence with skill \nWork out new wax or clinging honey mould. \nSo when the cage-escaped hosts you see \nFloat heavenward through the hot clear air, until \nYou marvel at yon dusky cloud that spreads \nAnd lengthens on the wind, then mark them well; \nFor then 'tis ever the fresh springs they seek \nAnd bowery shelter: hither must you bring \nThe savoury sweets I bid, and sprinkle them, \nBruised balsam and the wax-flower's lowly weed, \nAnd wake and shake the tinkling cymbals heard \nBy the great Mother: on the anointed spots \nThemselves will settle, and in wonted wise \nSeek of themselves the cradle's inmost depth. \nBut if to battle they have hied them forth- \nFor oft 'twixt king and king with uproar dire \nFierce feud arises, and at once from far \nYou may discern what passion sways the mob, \nAnd how their hearts are throbbing for the strife; \nHark! the hoarse brazen note that warriors know \nChides on the loiterers, and the ear may catch \nA sound that mocks the war-trump's broken blasts; \nThen in hot haste they muster, then flash wings, \nSharpen their pointed beaks and knit their thews, \nAnd round the king, even to his royal tent, \nThrong rallying, and with shouts defy the foe. \nSo, when a dry Spring and clear space is given, \nForth from the gates they burst, they clash on high; \nA din arises; they are heaped and rolled \nInto one mighty mass, and headlong fall, \nNot denselier hail through heaven, nor pelting so \nRains from the shaken oak its acorn-shower. \nConspicuous by their wings the chiefs themselves \nPress through the heart of battle, and display \nA giant's spirit in each pigmy frame, \nSteadfast no inch to yield till these or those \nThe victor's ponderous arm has turned to flight. \nSuch fiery passions and such fierce assaults \nA little sprinkled dust controls and quells. \nAnd now, both leaders from the field recalled, \nWho hath the worser seeming, do to death, \nLest royal waste wax burdensome, but let \nHis better lord it on the empty throne. \nOne with gold-burnished flakes will shine like fire, \nFor twofold are their kinds, the nobler he, \nOf peerless front and lit with flashing scales; \nThat other, from neglect and squalor foul, \nDrags slow a cumbrous belly. As with kings, \nSo too with people, diverse is their mould, \nSome rough and loathly, as when the wayfarer \nScapes from a whirl of dust, and scorched with heat \nSpits forth the dry grit from his parched mouth: \nThe others shine forth and flash with lightning-gleam, \nTheir backs all blazoned with bright drops of gold \nSymmetric: this the likelier breed; from these, \nWhen heaven brings round the season, thou shalt strain \nSweet honey, nor yet so sweet as passing clear, \nAnd mellowing on the tongue the wine-god's fire. \nBut when the swarms fly aimlessly abroad, \nDisport themselves in heaven and spurn their cells, \nLeaving the hive unwarmed, from such vain play \nMust you refrain their volatile desires, \nNor hard the task: tear off the monarchs' wings; \nWhile these prove loiterers, none beside will dare \nMount heaven, or pluck the standards from the camp. \nLet gardens with the breath of saffron flowers \nAllure them, and the lord of Hellespont, \nPriapus, wielder of the willow-scythe, \nSafe in his keeping hold from birds and thieves. \nAnd let the man to whom such cares are dear \nHimself bring thyme and pine-trees from the heights, \nAnd strew them in broad belts about their home; \nNo hand but his the blistering task should ply, \nPlant the young slips, or shed the genial showers. \nAnd I myself, were I not even now \nFurling my sails, and, nigh the journey's end, \nEager to turn my vessel's prow to shore, \nPerchance would sing what careful husbandry \nMakes the trim garden smile; of Paestum too, \nWhose roses bloom and fade and bloom again; \nHow endives glory in the streams they drink, \nAnd green banks in their parsley, and how the gourd \nTwists through the grass and rounds him to paunch; \nNor of Narcissus had my lips been dumb, \nThat loiterer of the flowers, nor supple-stemmed \nAcanthus, with the praise of ivies pale, \nAnd myrtles clinging to the shores they love. \nFor 'neath the shade of tall Oebalia's towers, \nWhere dark Galaesus laves the yellowing fields, \nAn old man once I mind me to have seen- \nFrom Corycus he came- to whom had fallen \nSome few poor acres of neglected land, \nAnd they nor fruitful' neath the plodding steer, \nMeet for the grazing herd, nor good for vines. \nYet he, the while his meagre garden-herbs \nAmong the thorns he planted, and all round \nWhite lilies, vervains, and lean poppy set, \nIn pride of spirit matched the wealth of kings, \nAnd home returning not till night was late, \nWith unbought plenty heaped his board on high. \nHe was the first to cull the rose in spring, \nHe the ripe fruits in autumn; and ere yet \nWinter had ceased in sullen ire to rive \nThe rocks with frost, and with her icy bit \nCurb in the running waters, there was he \nPlucking the rathe faint hyacinth, while he chid \nSummer's slow footsteps and the lagging West. \nTherefore he too with earliest brooding bees \nAnd their full swarms o'erflowed, and first was he \nTo press the bubbling honey from the comb; \nLime-trees were his, and many a branching pine; \nAnd all the fruits wherewith in early bloom \nThe orchard-tree had clothed her, in full tale \nHung there, by mellowing autumn perfected. \nHe too transplanted tall-grown elms a-row, \nTime-toughened pear, thorns bursting with the plum \nAnd plane now yielding serviceable shade \nFor dry lips to drink under: but these things, \nShut off by rigorous limits, I pass by, \nAnd leave for others to sing after me. \nCome, then, I will unfold the natural powers \nGreat Jove himself upon the bees bestowed, \nThe boon for which, led by the shrill sweet strains \nOf the Curetes and their clashing brass, \nThey fed the King of heaven in Dicte's cave. \nAlone of all things they receive and hold \nCommunity of offspring, and they house \nTogether in one city, and beneath \nThe shelter of majestic laws they live; \nAnd they alone fixed home and country know, \nAnd in the summer, warned of coming cold, \nMake proof of toil, and for the general store \nHoard up their gathered harvesting. For some \nWatch o'er the victualling of the hive, and these \nBy settled order ply their tasks afield; \nAnd some within the confines of their home \nPlant firm the comb's first layer, Narcissus' tear, \nAnd sticky gum oozed from the bark of trees, \nThen set the clinging wax to hang therefrom. \nOthers the while lead forth the full-grown young, \nTheir country's hope, and others press and pack \nThe thrice repured honey, and stretch their cells \nTo bursting with the clear-strained nectar sweet. \nSome, too, the wardship of the gates befalls, \nWho watch in turn for showers and cloudy skies, \nOr ease returning labourers of their load, \nOr form a band and from their precincts drive \nThe drones, a lazy herd. How glows the work! \nHow sweet the honey smells of perfumed thyme \nLike the Cyclopes, when in haste they forge \nFrom the slow-yielding ore the thunderbolts, \nSome from the bull's-hide bellows in and out \nLet the blasts drive, some dip i' the water-trough \nThe sputtering metal: with the anvil's weight \nGroans Etna: they alternately in time \nWith giant strength uplift their sinewy arms, \nOr twist the iron with the forceps' grip- \nNot otherwise, to measure small with great, \nThe love of getting planted in their breasts \nGoads on the bees, that haunt old Cecrops' heights, \nEach in his sphere to labour. The old have charge \nTo keep the town, and build the walled combs, \nAnd mould the cunning chambers; but the youth, \nTheir tired legs packed with thyme, come labouring home \nBelated, for afar they range to feed \nOn arbutes and the grey-green willow-leaves, \nAnd cassia and the crocus blushing red, \nGlue-yielding limes, and hyacinths dusky-eyed. \nOne hour for rest have all, and one for toil: \nWith dawn they hurry from the gates- no room \nFor loiterers there: and once again, when even \nNow bids them quit their pasturing on the plain, \nThen homeward make they, then refresh their strength: \nA hum arises: hark! they buzz and buzz \nAbout the doors and threshold; till at length \nSafe laid to rest they hush them for the night, \nAnd welcome slumber laps their weary limbs. \nBut from the homestead not too far they fare, \nWhen showers hang like to fall, nor, east winds nigh, \nConfide in heaven, but 'neath the city walls \nSafe-circling fetch them water, or essay \nBrief out-goings, and oft weigh-up tiny stones, \nAs light craft ballast in the tossing tide, \nWherewith they poise them through the cloudy vast. \nThis law of life, too, by the bees obeyed, \nWill move thy wonder, that nor sex with sex \nYoke they in marriage, nor yield their limbs to love, \nNor know the pangs of labour, but alone \nFrom leaves and honied herbs, the mothers, each, \nGather their offspring in their mouths, alone \nSupply new kings and pigmy commonwealth, \nAnd their old court and waxen realm repair. \nOft, too, while wandering, against jagged stones \nTheir wings they fray, and 'neath the burden yield \nTheir liberal lives: so deep their love of flowers, \nSo glorious deem they honey's proud acquist. \nTherefore, though each a life of narrow span, \nNe'er stretched to summers more than seven, befalls, \nYet deathless doth the race endure, and still \nPerennial stands the fortune of their line, \nFrom grandsire unto grandsire backward told. \nMoreover, not Aegyptus, nor the realm \nOf boundless Lydia, no, nor Parthia's hordes, \nNor Median Hydaspes, to their king \nDo such obeisance: lives the king unscathed, \nOne will inspires the million: is he dead, \nSnapt is the bond of fealty; they themselves \nRavage their toil-wrought honey, and rend amain \nTheir own comb's waxen trellis. He is the lord \nOf all their labour; him with awful eye \nThey reverence, and with murmuring throngs surround, \nIn crowds attend, oft shoulder him on high, \nOr with their bodies shield him in the fight, \nAnd seek through showering wounds a glorious death. \nLed by these tokens, and with such traits to guide, \nSome say that unto bees a share is given \nOf the Divine Intelligence, and to drink \nPure draughts of ether; for God permeates all- \nEarth, and wide ocean, and the vault of heaven- \nFrom whom flocks, herds, men, beasts of every kind, \nDraw each at birth the fine essential flame; \nYea, and that all things hence to Him return, \nBrought back by dissolution, nor can death \nFind place: but, each into his starry rank, \nAlive they soar, and mount the heights of heaven. \nIf now their narrow home thou wouldst unseal, \nAnd broach the treasures of the honey-house, \nWith draught of water first toment thy lips, \nAnd spread before thee fumes of trailing smoke. \nTwice is the teeming produce gathered in, \nTwofold their time of harvest year by year, \nOnce when Taygete the Pleiad uplifts \nHer comely forehead for the earth to see, \nWith foot of scorn spurning the ocean-streams, \nOnce when in gloom she flies the watery Fish, \nAnd dips from heaven into the wintry wave. \nUnbounded then their wrath; if hurt, they breathe \nVenom into their bite, cleave to the veins \nAnd let the sting lie buried, and leave their lives \nBehind them in the wound. But if you dread \nToo rigorous a winter, and would fain \nTemper the coming time, and their bruised hearts \nAnd broken estate to pity move thy soul, \nYet who would fear to fumigate with thyme, \nOr cut the empty wax away? for oft \nInto their comb the newt has gnawed unseen, \nAnd the light-loathing beetles crammed their bed, \nAnd he that sits at others' board to feast, \nThe do-naught drone; or 'gainst the unequal foe \nSwoops the fierce hornet, or the moth's fell tribe; \nOr spider, victim of Minerva's spite, \nAthwart the doorway hangs her swaying net. \nThe more impoverished they, the keenlier all \nTo mend the fallen fortunes of their race \nWill nerve them, fill the cells up, tier on tier, \nAnd weave their granaries from the rifled flowers. \nNow, seeing that life doth even to bee-folk bring \nOur human chances, if in dire disease \nTheir bodies' strength should languish- which anon \nBy no uncertain tokens may be told- \nForthwith the sick change hue; grim leanness mars \nTheir visage; then from out the cells they bear \nForms reft of light, and lead the mournful pomp; \nOr foot to foot about the porch they hang, \nOr within closed doors loiter, listless all \nFrom famine, and benumbed with shrivelling cold. \nThen is a deep note heard, a long-drawn hum, \nAs when the chill South through the forests sighs, \nAs when the troubled ocean hoarsely booms \nWith back-swung billow, as ravening tide of fire \nSurges, shut fast within the furnace-walls. \nThen do I bid burn scented galbanum, \nAnd, honey-streams through reeden troughs instilled, \nChallenge and cheer their flagging appetite \nTo taste the well-known food; and it shall boot \nTo mix therewith the savour bruised from gall, \nAnd rose-leaves dried, or must to thickness boiled \nBy a fierce fire, or juice of raisin-grapes \nFrom Psithian vine, and with its bitter smell \nCentaury, and the famed Cecropian thyme. \nThere is a meadow-flower by country folk \nHight star-wort; 'tis a plant not far to seek; \nFor from one sod an ample growth it rears, \nItself all golden, but girt with plenteous leaves, \nWhere glory of purple shines through violet gloom. \nWith chaplets woven hereof full oft are decked \nHeaven's altars: harsh its taste upon the tongue; \nShepherds in vales smooth-shorn of nibbling flocks \nBy Mella's winding waters gather it. \nThe roots of this, well seethed in fragrant wine, \nSet in brimmed baskets at their doors for food. \nBut if one's whole stock fail him at a stroke, \nNor hath he whence to breed the race anew, \n'Tis time the wondrous secret to disclose \nTaught by the swain of Arcady, even how \nThe blood of slaughtered bullocks oft has borne \nBees from corruption. I will trace me back \nTo its prime source the story's tangled thread, \nAnd thence unravel. For where thy happy folk, \nCanopus, city of Pellaean fame, \nDwell by the Nile's lagoon-like overflow, \nAnd high o'er furrows they have called their own \nSkim in their painted wherries; where, hard by, \nThe quivered Persian presses, and that flood \nWhich from the swart-skinned Aethiop bears him down, \nSwift-parted into sevenfold branching mouths \nWith black mud fattens and makes Aegypt green, \nThat whole domain its welfare's hope secure \nRests on this art alone. And first is chosen \nA strait recess, cramped closer to this end, \nWhich next with narrow roof of tiles atop \n'Twixt prisoning walls they pinch, and add hereto \nFrom the four winds four slanting window-slits. \nThen seek they from the herd a steer, whose horns \nWith two years' growth are curling, and stop fast, \nPlunge madly as he may, the panting mouth \nAnd nostrils twain, and done with blows to death, \nBatter his flesh to pulp i' the hide yet whole, \nAnd shut the doors, and leave him there to lie. \nBut 'neath his ribs they scatter broken boughs, \nWith thyme and fresh-pulled cassias: this is done \nWhen first the west winds bid the waters flow, \nEre flush the meadows with new tints, and ere \nThe twittering swallow buildeth from the beams. \nMeanwhile the juice within his softened bones \nHeats and ferments, and things of wondrous birth, \nFootless at first, anon with feet and wings, \nSwarm there and buzz, a marvel to behold; \nAnd more and more the fleeting breeze they take, \nTill, like a shower that pours from summer-clouds, \nForth burst they, or like shafts from quivering string \nWhen Parthia's flying hosts provoke the fray. \nSay what was he, what God, that fashioned forth \nThis art for us, O Muses? of man's skill \nWhence came the new adventure? From thy vale, \nPeneian Tempe, turning, bee-bereft, \nSo runs the tale, by famine and disease, \nMournful the shepherd Aristaeus stood \nFast by the haunted river-head, and thus \nWith many a plaint to her that bare him cried: \n\"Mother, Cyrene, mother, who hast thy home \nBeneath this whirling flood, if he thou sayest, \nApollo, lord of Thymbra, be my sire, \nSprung from the Gods' high line, why barest thou me \nWith fortune's ban for birthright? Where is now \nThy love to me-ward banished from thy breast? \nO! wherefore didst thou bid me hope for heaven? \nLo! even the crown of this poor mortal life, \nWhich all my skilful care by field and fold, \nNo art neglected, scarce had fashioned forth, \nEven this falls from me, yet thou call'st me son. \nNay, then, arise! With thine own hands pluck up \nMy fruit-plantations: on the homestead fling \nPitiless fire; make havoc of my crops; \nBurn the young plants, and wield the stubborn axe \nAgainst my vines, if there hath taken the \nSuch loathing of my greatness.\" But that cry, \nEven from her chamber in the river-deeps, \nHis mother heard: around her spun the nymphs \nMilesian wool stained through with hyaline dye, \nDrymo, Xantho, Ligea, Phyllodoce, \nTheir glossy locks o'er snowy shoulders shed, \nCydippe and Lycorias yellow-haired, \nA maiden one, one newly learned even then \nTo bear Lucina's birth-pang. Clio, too, \nAnd Beroe, sisters, ocean-children both, \nBoth zoned with gold and girt with dappled fell, \nEphyre and Opis, and from Asian meads \nDeiopea, and, bow at length laid by, \nFleet-footed Arethusa. But in their midst \nFair Clymene was telling o'er the tale \nOf Vulcan's idle vigilance and the stealth \nOf Mars' sweet rapine, and from Chaos old \nCounted the jostling love-joys of the Gods. \nCharmed by whose lay, the while their woolly tasks \nWith spindles down they drew, yet once again \nSmote on his mother's ears the mournful plaint \nOf Aristaeus; on their glassy thrones \nAmazement held them all; but Arethuse \nBefore the rest put forth her auburn head, \nPeering above the wave-top, and from far \nExclaimed, \"Cyrene, sister, not for naught \nScared by a groan so deep, behold! 'tis he, \nEven Aristaeus, thy heart's fondest care, \nHere by the brink of the Peneian sire \nStands woebegone and weeping, and by name \nCries out upon thee for thy cruelty.\" \nTo whom, strange terror knocking at her heart, \n\"Bring, bring him to our sight,\" the mother cried; \n\"His feet may tread the threshold even of Gods.\" \nSo saying, she bids the flood yawn wide and yield \nA pathway for his footsteps; but the wave \nArched mountain-wise closed round him, and within \nIts mighty bosom welcomed, and let speed \nTo the deep river-bed. And now, with eyes \nOf wonder gazing on his mother's hall \nAnd watery kingdom and cave-prisoned pools \nAnd echoing groves, he went, and, stunned by that \nStupendous whirl of waters, separate saw \nAll streams beneath the mighty earth that glide, \nPhasis and Lycus, and that fountain-head \nWhence first the deep Enipeus leaps to light, \nWhence father Tiber, and whence Anio's flood, \nAnd Hypanis that roars amid his rocks, \nAnd Mysian Caicus, and, bull-browed \n'Twixt either gilded horn, Eridanus, \nThan whom none other through the laughing plains \nMore furious pours into the purple sea. \nSoon as the chamber's hanging roof of stone \nWas gained, and now Cyrene from her son \nHad heard his idle weeping, in due course \nClear water for his hands the sisters bring, \nWith napkins of shorn pile, while others heap \nThe board with dainties, and set on afresh \nThe brimming goblets; with Panchaian fires \nUpleap the altars; then the mother spake, \n\"Take beakers of Maconian wine,\" she said, \n\"Pour we to Ocean.\" Ocean, sire of all, \nShe worships, and the sister-nymphs who guard \nThe hundred forests and the hundred streams; \nThrice Vesta's fire with nectar clear she dashed, \nThrice to the roof-top shot the flame and shone: \nArmed with which omen she essayed to speak: \n\"In Neptune's gulf Carpathian dwells a seer, \nCaerulean Proteus, he who metes the main \nWith fish-drawn chariot of two-footed steeds; \nNow visits he his native home once more, \nPallene and the Emathian ports; to him \nWe nymphs do reverence, ay, and Nereus old; \nFor all things knows the seer, both those which are \nAnd have been, or which time hath yet to bring; \nSo willed it Neptune, whose portentous flocks, \nAnd loathly sea-calves 'neath the surge he feeds. \nHim first, my son, behoves thee seize and bind \nThat he may all the cause of sickness show, \nAnd grant a prosperous end. For save by force \nNo rede will he vouchsafe, nor shalt thou bend \nHis soul by praying; whom once made captive, ply \nWith rigorous force and fetters; against these \nHis wiles will break and spend themselves in vain. \nI, when the sun has lit his noontide fires, \nWhen the blades thirst, and cattle love the shade, \nMyself will guide thee to the old man's haunt, \nWhither he hies him weary from the waves, \nThat thou mayst safelier steal upon his sleep. \nBut when thou hast gripped him fast with hand and gyve, \nThen divers forms and bestial semblances \nShall mock thy grasp; for sudden he will change \nTo bristly boar, fell tigress, dragon scaled, \nAnd tawny-tufted lioness, or send forth \nA crackling sound of fire, and so shake of \nThe fetters, or in showery drops anon \nDissolve and vanish. But the more he shifts \nHis endless transformations, thou, my son, \nMore straitlier clench the clinging bands, until \nHis body's shape return to that thou sawest, \nWhen with closed eyelids first he sank to sleep.\" \nSo saying, an odour of ambrosial dew \nShe sheds around, and all his frame therewith \nSteeps throughly; forth from his trim-combed locks \nBreathed effluence sweet, and a lithe vigour leapt \nInto his limbs. There is a cavern vast \nScooped in the mountain-side, where wave on wave \nBy the wind's stress is driven, and breaks far up \nIts inmost creeks- safe anchorage from of old \nFor tempest-taken mariners: therewithin, \nBehind a rock's huge barrier, Proteus hides. \nHere in close covert out of the sun's eye \nThe youth she places, and herself the while \nSwathed in a shadowy mist stands far aloof. \nAnd now the ravening dog-star that burns up \nThe thirsty Indians blazed in heaven; his course \nThe fiery sun had half devoured: the blades \nWere parched, and the void streams with droughty jaws \nBaked to their mud-beds by the scorching ray, \nWhen Proteus seeking his accustomed cave \nStrode from the billows: round him frolicking \nThe watery folk that people the waste sea \nSprinkled the bitter brine-dew far and wide. \nAlong the shore in scattered groups to feed \nThe sea-calves stretch them: while the seer himself, \nLike herdsman on the hills when evening bids \nThe steers from pasture to their stall repair, \nAnd the lambs' bleating whets the listening wolves, \nSits midmost on the rock and tells his tale. \nBut Aristaeus, the foe within his clutch, \nScarce suffering him compose his aged limbs, \nWith a great cry leapt on him, and ere he rose \nForestalled him with the fetters; he nathless, \nAll unforgetful of his ancient craft, \nTransforms himself to every wondrous thing, \nFire and a fearful beast, and flowing stream. \nBut when no trickery found a path for flight, \nBaffled at length, to his own shape returned, \nWith human lips he spake, \"Who bade thee, then, \nSo reckless in youth's hardihood, affront \nOur portals? or what wouldst thou hence?\"- But he, \n\"Proteus, thou knowest, of thine own heart thou knowest;\n\nFor thee there is no cheating, but cease thou \nTo practise upon me: at heaven's behest \nI for my fainting fortunes hither come \nAn oracle to ask thee.\" There he ceased. \nWhereat the seer, by stubborn force constrained, \nShot forth the grey light of his gleaming eyes \nUpon him, and with fiercely gnashing teeth \nUnlocks his lips to spell the fates of heaven: \n\"Doubt not 'tis wrath divine that plagues thee thus, \nNor light the debt thou payest; 'tis Orpheus' self, \nOrpheus unhappy by no fault of his, \nSo fates prevent not, fans thy penal fires, \nYet madly raging for his ravished bride. \nShe in her haste to shun thy hot pursuit \nAlong the stream, saw not the coming death, \nWhere at her feet kept ward upon the bank \nIn the tall grass a monstrous water-snake. \nBut with their cries the Dryad-band her peers \nFilled up the mountains to their proudest peaks: \nWailed for her fate the heights of Rhodope, \nAnd tall Pangaea, and, beloved of Mars, \nThe land that bowed to Rhesus, Thrace no less \nWith Hebrus' stream; and Orithyia wept, \nDaughter of Acte old. But Orpheus' self, \nSoothing his love-pain with the hollow shell, \nThee his sweet wife on the lone shore alone, \nThee when day dawned and when it died he sang. \nNay to the jaws of Taenarus too he came, \nOf Dis the infernal palace, and the grove \nGrim with a horror of great darkness- came, \nEntered, and faced the Manes and the King \nOf terrors, the stone heart no prayer can tame. \nThen from the deepest deeps of Erebus, \nWrung by his minstrelsy, the hollow shades \nCame trooping, ghostly semblances of forms \nLost to the light, as birds by myriads hie \nTo greenwood boughs for cover, when twilight-hour \nOr storms of winter chase them from the hills; \nMatrons and men, and great heroic frames \nDone with life's service, boys, unwedded girls, \nYouths placed on pyre before their fathers' eyes. \nRound them, with black slime choked and hideous weed, \nCocytus winds; there lies the unlovely swamp \nOf dull dead water, and, to pen them fast, \nStyx with her ninefold barrier poured between. \nNay, even the deep Tartarean Halls of death \nStood lost in wonderment, and the Eumenides, \nTheir brows with livid locks of serpents twined; \nEven Cerberus held his triple jaws agape, \nAnd, the wind hushed, Ixion's wheel stood still. \nAnd now with homeward footstep he had passed \nAll perils scathless, and, at length restored, \nEurydice to realms of upper air \nHad well-nigh won, behind him following- \nSo Proserpine had ruled it- when his heart \nA sudden mad desire surprised and seized- \nMeet fault to be forgiven, might Hell forgive. \nFor at the very threshold of the day, \nHeedless, alas! and vanquished of resolve, \nHe stopped, turned, looked upon Eurydice \nHis own once more. But even with the look, \nPoured out was all his labour, broken the bond \nOf that fell tyrant, and a crash was heard \nThree times like thunder in the meres of hell. \n'Orpheus! what ruin hath thy frenzy wrought \nOn me, alas! and thee? Lo! once again \nThe unpitying fates recall me, and dark sleep \nCloses my swimming eyes. And now farewell: \nGirt with enormous night I am borne away, \nOutstretching toward thee, thine, alas! no more, \nThese helpless hands.' She spake, and suddenly, \nLike smoke dissolving into empty air, \nPassed and was sundered from his sight; nor him \nClutching vain shadows, yearning sore to speak, \nThenceforth beheld she, nor no second time \nHell's boatman brooks he pass the watery bar. \nWhat should he do? fly whither, twice bereaved? \nMove with what tears the Manes, with what voice \nThe Powers of darkness? She indeed even now \nDeath-cold was floating on the Stygian barge! \nFor seven whole months unceasingly, men say, \nBeneath a skyey crag, by thy lone wave, \nStrymon, he wept, and in the caverns chill \nUnrolled his story, melting tigers' hearts, \nAnd leading with his lay the oaks along. \nAs in the poplar-shade a nightingale \nMourns her lost young, which some relentless swain, \nSpying, from the nest has torn unfledged, but she \nWails the long night, and perched upon a spray \nWith sad insistence pipes her dolorous strain, \nTill all the region with her wrongs o'erflows. \nNo love, no new desire, constrained his soul: \nBy snow-bound Tanais and the icy north, \nFar steppes to frost Rhipaean forever wed, \nAlone he wandered, lost Eurydice \nLamenting, and the gifts of Dis ungiven. \nScorned by which tribute the Ciconian dames, \nAmid their awful Bacchanalian rites \nAnd midnight revellings, tore him limb from limb, \nAnd strewed his fragments over the wide fields. \nThen too, even then, what time the Hebrus stream, \nOeagrian Hebrus, down mid-current rolled, \nRent from the marble neck, his drifting head, \nThe death-chilled tongue found yet a voice to cry \n'Eurydice! ah! poor Eurydice!' \nWith parting breath he called her, and the banks \nFrom the broad stream caught up 'Eurydice!'\" \nSo Proteus ending plunged into the deep, \nAnd, where he plunged, beneath the eddying whirl \nChurned into foam the water, and was gone; \nBut not Cyrene, who unquestioned thus \nBespake the trembling listener: \"Nay, my son, \nFrom that sad bosom thou mayst banish care: \nHence came that plague of sickness, hence the nymphs, \nWith whom in the tall woods the dance she wove, \nWrought on thy bees, alas! this deadly bane. \nBend thou before the Dell-nymphs, gracious powers: \nBring gifts, and sue for pardon: they will grant \nPeace to thine asking, and an end of wrath. \nBut how to approach them will I first unfold- \nFour chosen bulls of peerless form and bulk, \nThat browse to-day the green Lycaean heights, \nPick from thy herds, as many kine to match, \nWhose necks the yoke pressed never: then for these \nBuild up four altars by the lofty fanes, \nAnd from their throats let gush the victims' blood, \nAnd in the greenwood leave their bodies lone. \nThen, when the ninth dawn hath displayed its beams, \nTo Orpheus shalt thou send his funeral dues, \nPoppies of Lethe, and let slay a sheep \nCoal-black, then seek the grove again, and soon \nFor pardon found adore Eurydice \nWith a slain calf for victim.\" \n\nNo delay: \nThe self-same hour he hies him forth to do \nHis mother's bidding: to the shrine he came, \nThe appointed altars reared, and thither led \nFour chosen bulls of peerless form and bulk, \nWith kine to match, that never yoke had known; \nThen, when the ninth dawn had led in the day, \nTo Orpheus sent his funeral dues, and sought \nThe grove once more. But sudden, strange to tell \nA portent they espy: through the oxen's flesh, \nWaxed soft in dissolution, hark! there hum \nBees from the belly; the rent ribs overboil \nIn endless clouds they spread them, till at last \nOn yon tree-top together fused they cling, \nAnd drop their cluster from the bending boughs. \nSo sang I of the tilth of furrowed fields, \nOf flocks and trees, while Caesar's majesty \nLaunched forth the levin-bolts of war by deep \nEuphrates, and bare rule o'er willing folk \nThough vanquished, and essayed the heights of heaven. \nI Virgil then, of sweet Parthenope \nThe nursling, wooed the flowery walks of peace \nInglorious, who erst trilled for shepherd-wights \nThe wanton ditty, and sang in saucy youth \nThee, Tityrus, 'neath the spreading beech tree's shade. \n\nTHE END\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n", "aeneid": "The Aeneid\nBy Virgil\n\n\nTranslated by John Dryden\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK I\n\nArms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate, \nAnd haughty Juno's unrelenting hate, \nExpell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore. \nLong labors, both by sea and land, he bore, \nAnd in the doubtful war, before he won \nThe Latian realm, and built the destin'd town; \nHis banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine, \nAnd settled sure succession in his line, \nFrom whence the race of Alban fathers come, \nAnd the long glories of majestic Rome. \nO Muse! the causes and the crimes relate; \nWhat goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate; \nFor what offense the Queen of Heav'n began \nTo persecute so brave, so just a man; \nInvolv'd his anxious life in endless cares, \nExpos'd to wants, and hurried into wars! \nCan heav'nly minds such high resentment show, \nOr exercise their spite in human woe? \nAgainst the Tiber's mouth, but far away, \nAn ancient town was seated on the sea; \nA Tyrian colony; the people made \nStout for the war, and studious of their trade: \nCarthage the name; belov'd by Juno more \nThan her own Argos, or the Samian shore. \nHere stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind, \nThe seat of awful empire she design'd. \nYet she had heard an ancient rumor fly, \n(Long cited by the people of the sky,) \nThat times to come should see the Trojan race \nHer Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface; \nNor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway \nShould on the necks of all the nations lay. \nShe ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate; \nNor could forget the war she wag'd of late \nFor conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state. \nBesides, long causes working in her mind, \nAnd secret seeds of envy, lay behind; \nDeep graven in her heart the doom remain'd \nOf partial Paris, and her form disdain'd; \nThe grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed, \nElectra's glories, and her injur'd bed. \nEach was a cause alone; and all combin'd \nTo kindle vengeance in her haughty mind. \nFor this, far distant from the Latian coast \nShe drove the remnants of the Trojan host; \nAnd sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train \nWere toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main. \nSuch time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name, \nSuch length of labor for so vast a frame. \nNow scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars, \nHad left behind the fair Sicilian shores, \nEnt'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign, \nAnd plowing frothy furrows in the main; \nWhen, lab'ring still with endless discontent, \nThe Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent: \n\"Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?\" said she, \n\"And must the Trojans reign in Italy? \nSo Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force; \nNor can my pow'r divert their happy course. \nCould angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen, \nThe Grecian navy burn, and drown the men? \nShe, for the fault of one offending foe, \nThe bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw: \nWith whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship, \nAnd bare expos'd the bosom of the deep; \nThen, as an eagle gripes the trembling game, \nThe wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame, \nShe strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound \nTransfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound. \nBut I, who walk in awful state above, \nThe majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove, \nFor length of years my fruitless force employ \nAgainst the thin remains of ruin'd Troy! \nWhat nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray, \nOr off'rings on my slighted altars lay?\" \nThus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught. \nThe restless regions of the storms she sought, \nWhere, in a spacious cave of living stone, \nThe tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne, \nWith pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds, \nAnd sounding tempests in dark prisons binds. \nThis way and that th' impatient captives tend, \nAnd, pressing for release, the mountains rend. \nHigh in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands, \nAnd shakes his scepter, and their rage commands; \nWhich did he not, their unresisted sway \nWould sweep the world before them in their way; \nEarth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll, \nAnd heav'n would fly before the driving soul. \nIn fear of this, the Father of the Gods \nConfin'd their fury to those dark abodes, \nAnd lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;\n\nImpos'd a king, with arbitrary sway, \nTo loose their fetters, or their force allay. \nTo whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd, \nAnd thus the tenor of her suit express'd: \n\"O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n \nThe pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n; \nThy force alone their fury can restrain, \nAnd smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main- \nA race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me, \nWith prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea; \nTo fruitful Italy their course they steer, \nAnd for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there. \nRaise all thy winds; with night involve the skies; \nSink or disperse my fatal enemies. \nTwice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main, \nAround my person wait, and bear my train: \nSucceed my wish, and second my design; \nThe fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine, \nAnd make thee father of a happy line.\" \nTo this the god: \"'T is yours, O queen, to will \nThe work which duty binds me to fulfil. \nThese airy kingdoms, and this wide command, \nAre all the presents of your bounteous hand: \nYours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest, \nI sit with gods at their celestial feast; \nRaise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue; \nDispose of empire, which I hold from you.\" \nHe said, and hurl'd against the mountain side \nHis quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied. \nThe raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound, \nAnd dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground; \nThen, settling on the sea, the surges sweep, \nRaise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep. \nSouth, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar, \nAnd roll the foaming billows to the shore. \nThe cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries \nAscend; and sable night involves the skies; \nAnd heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes. \nLoud peals of thunder from the poles ensue; \nThen flashing fires the transient light renew; \nThe face of things a frightful image bears, \nAnd present death in various forms appears. \nStruck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief, \nWith lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief; \nAnd, \"Thrice and four times happy those,\" he cried, \n\"That under Ilian walls before their parents died! \nTydides, bravest of the Grecian train! \nWhy could not I by that strong arm be slain, \nAnd lie by noble Hector on the plain, \nOr great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields \nWhere Simois rolls the bodies and the shields \nOf heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear \nThe dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!\" \nThus while the pious prince his fate bewails, \nFierce Boreas drove against his flying sails, \nAnd rent the sheets; the raging billows rise, \nAnd mount the tossing vessels to the skies: \nNor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow; \nThe galley gives her side, and turns her prow; \nWhile those astern, descending down the steep, \nThro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep. \nThree ships were hurried by the southern blast, \nAnd on the secret shelves with fury cast. \nThose hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew: \nThey call'd them Altars, when they rose in view, \nAnd show'd their spacious backs above the flood. \nThree more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood, \nDash'd on the shallows of the moving sand, \nAnd in mid ocean left them moor'd aland. \nOrontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew, \n(A horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view, \nFrom stem to stern by waves was overborne: \nThe trembling pilot, from his rudder torn, \nWas headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd, \nThen bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost; \nAnd here and there above the waves were seen \nArms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men. \nThe stoutest vessel to the storm gave way, \nAnd suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea. \nIlioneus was her chief: Alethes old, \nAchates faithful, Abas young and bold, \nEndur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams, \nAdmit the deluge of the briny streams. \nMeantime imperial Neptune heard the sound \nOf raging billows breaking on the ground. \nDispleas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign, \nHe rear'd his awful head above the main, \nSerene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes \nAround the space of earth, and seas, and skies. \nHe saw the Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd, \nBy stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd. \nFull well the god his sister's envy knew, \nAnd what her aims and what her arts pursue. \nHe summon'd Eurus and the western blast, \nAnd first an angry glance on both he cast; \nThen thus rebuk'd: \"Audacious winds! from whence \nThis bold attempt, this rebel insolence? \nIs it for you to ravage seas and land, \nUnauthoriz'd by my supreme command? \nTo raise such mountains on the troubled main? \nWhom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain; \nAnd then you shall be taught obedience to my reign. \nHence! to your lord my royal mandate bear- \nThe realms of ocean and the fields of air \nAre mine, not his. By fatal lot to me \nThe liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea. \nHis pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd: \nThere let him reign, the jailer of the wind, \nWith hoarse commands his breathing subjects call, \nAnd boast and bluster in his empty hall.\" \nHe spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea, \nDispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day. \nCymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train \nOf beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main, \nClear from the rocks the vessels with their hands: \nThe god himself with ready trident stands, \nAnd opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands; \nThen heaves them off the shoals. Where'er he guides \nHis finny coursers and in triumph rides, \nThe waves unruffle and the sea subsides. \nAs, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd, \nMad are their motions, and their tongues are loud; \nAnd stones and brands in rattling volleys fly, \nAnd all the rustic arms that fury can supply: \nIf then some grave and pious man appear, \nThey hush their noise, and lend a list'ning ear; \nHe soothes with sober words their angry mood, \nAnd quenches their innate desire of blood: \nSo, when the Father of the Flood appears, \nAnd o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears, \nTheir fury falls: he skims the liquid plains, \nHigh on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins, \nMajestic moves along, and awful peace maintains. \nThe weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars \nTo nearest land, and make the Libyan shores. \nWithin a long recess there lies a bay: \nAn island shades it from the rolling sea, \nAnd forms a port secure for ships to ride; \nBroke by the jutting land, on either side, \nIn double streams the briny waters glide. \nBetwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene \nAppears above, and groves for ever green: \nA grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats, \nTo rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats. \nDown thro' the crannies of the living walls \nThe crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls: \nNo haulsers need to bind the vessels here, \nNor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear. \nSev'n ships within this happy harbor meet, \nThe thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet. \nThe Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes, \nLeap on the welcome land, and seek their wish'd repose. \nFirst, good Achates, with repeated strokes \nOf clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes: \nShort flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves \nThe dying sparkles in their fall receives: \nCaught into life, in fiery fumes they rise, \nAnd, fed with stronger food, invade the skies. \nThe Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around \nThe cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground: \nSome dry their corn, infected with the brine, \nThen grind with marbles, and prepare to dine. \nAeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow, \nAnd takes a prospect of the seas below, \nIf Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy, \nOr see the streamers of Caicus fly. \nNo vessels were in view; but, on the plain, \nThree beamy stags command a lordly train \nOf branching heads: the more ignoble throng \nAttend their stately steps, and slowly graze along. \nHe stood; and, while secure they fed below, \nHe took the quiver and the trusty bow \nAchates us'd to bear: the leaders first \nHe laid along, and then the vulgar pierc'd; \nNor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain \nSev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain. \nFor the sev'n ships he made an equal share, \nAnd to the port return'd, triumphant from the war. \nThe jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' gift, \nWhen his Trinacrian shores the navy left) \nHe set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd, \nIn equal portions with the ven'son shar'd. \nThus while he dealt it round, the pious chief \nWith cheerful words allay'd the common grief: \n\"Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose \nTo future good our past and present woes. \nWith me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried; \nTh' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied. \nWhat greater ills hereafter can you bear? \nResume your courage and dismiss your care, \nAn hour will come, with pleasure to relate \nYour sorrows past, as benefits of Fate. \nThro' various hazards and events, we move \nTo Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove. \nCall'd to the seat (the promise of the skies) \nWhere Trojan kingdoms once again may rise, \nEndure the hardships of your present state; \nLive, and reserve yourselves for better fate.\" \nThese words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart; \nHis outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart. \nThe jolly crew, unmindful of the past, \nThe quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste. \nSome strip the skin; some portion out the spoil; \nThe limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil; \nSome on the fire the reeking entrails broil. \nStretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine, \nRestore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with wine.\n\nTheir hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends \nThe doubtful fortune of their absent friends: \nAlternate hopes and fears their minds possess, \nWhether to deem 'em dead, or in distress. \nAbove the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate \nOf brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state \nOf Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus. \nThe day, but not their sorrows, ended thus. \nWhen, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys \nEarth, air, and shores, and navigable seas, \nAt length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes- \nWhom, pond'ring thus on human miseries, \nWhen Venus saw, she with a lowly look, \nNot free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke: \n\"O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand \nDisperses thunder on the seas and land, \nDisposing all with absolute command; \nHow could my pious son thy pow'r incense? \nOr what, alas! is vanish'd Troy's offense? \nOur hope of Italy not only lost, \nOn various seas by various tempests toss'd, \nBut shut from ev'ry shore, and barr'd from ev'ry coast. \nYou promis'd once, a progeny divine \nOf Romans, rising from the Trojan line, \nIn after times should hold the world in awe, \nAnd to the land and ocean give the law. \nHow is your doom revers'd, which eas'd my care \nWhen Troy was ruin'd in that cruel war? \nThen fates to fates I could oppose; but now, \nWhen Fortune still pursues her former blow, \nWhat can I hope? What worse can still succeed? \nWhat end of labors has your will decreed? \nAntenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts, \nCould pass secure, and pierce th' Illyrian coasts, \nWhere, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves \nAnd thro' nine channels disembogues his waves. \nAt length he founded Padua's happy seat, \nAnd gave his Trojans a secure retreat; \nThere fix'd their arms, and there renew'd their name, \nAnd there in quiet rules, and crown'd with fame. \nBut we, descended from your sacred line, \nEntitled to your heav'n and rites divine, \nAre banish'd earth; and, for the wrath of one, \nRemov'd from Latium and the promis'd throne. \nAre these our scepters? these our due rewards? \nAnd is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?\" \nTo whom the Father of th' immortal race, \nSmiling with that serene indulgent face, \nWith which he drives the clouds and clears the skies, \nFirst gave a holy kiss; then thus replies: \n\"Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire \nThe fates of thine are fix'd, and stand entire. \nThou shalt behold thy wish'd Lavinian walls; \nAnd, ripe for heav'n, when fate Aeneas calls, \nThen shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me: \nNo councils have revers'd my firm decree. \nAnd, lest new fears disturb thy happy state, \nKnow, I have search'd the mystic rolls of Fate: \nThy son (nor is th' appointed season far) \nIn Italy shall wage successful war, \nShall tame fierce nations in the bloody field, \nAnd sov'reign laws impose, and cities build, \nTill, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun \nThrice thro' the signs his annual race shall run: \nThis is his time prefix'd. Ascanius then, \nNow call'd Iulus, shall begin his reign. \nHe thirty rolling years the crown shall wear, \nThen from Lavinium shall the seat transfer, \nAnd, with hard labor, Alba Longa build. \nThe throne with his succession shall be fill'd \nThree hundred circuits more: then shall be seen \nIlia the fair, a priestess and a queen, \nWho, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes, \nShall at a birth two goodly boys disclose. \nThe royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain: \nThen Romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain, \nOf martial tow'rs the founder shall become, \nThe people Romans call, the city Rome. \nTo them no bounds of empire I assign, \nNor term of years to their immortal line. \nEv'n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils, \nEarth, seas, and heav'n, and Jove himself turmoils; \nAt length aton'd, her friendly pow'r shall join, \nTo cherish and advance the Trojan line. \nThe subject world shall Rome's dominion own, \nAnd, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown. \nAn age is ripening in revolving fate \nWhen Troy shall overturn the Grecian state, \nAnd sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call, \nTo crush the people that conspir'd her fall. \nThen Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise, \nWhose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies \nAlone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils, \nOur heav'n, the just reward of human toils, \nSecurely shall repay with rites divine; \nAnd incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine. \nThen dire debate and impious war shall cease, \nAnd the stern age be soften'd into peace: \nThen banish'd Faith shall once again return, \nAnd Vestal fires in hallow'd temples burn; \nAnd Remus with Quirinus shall sustain \nThe righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain. \nJanus himself before his fane shall wait, \nAnd keep the dreadful issues of his gate, \nWith bolts and iron bars: within remains \nImprison'd Fury, bound in brazen chains; \nHigh on a trophy rais'd, of useless arms, \nHe sits, and threats the world with vain alarms.\" \nHe said, and sent Cyllenius with command \nTo free the ports, and ope the Punic land \nTo Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate, \nThe queen might force them from her town and state. \nDown from the steep of heav'n Cyllenius flies, \nAnd cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies. \nSoon on the Libyan shore descends the god, \nPerforms his message, and displays his rod: \nThe surly murmurs of the people cease; \nAnd, as the fates requir'd, they give the peace: \nThe queen herself suspends the rigid laws, \nThe Trojans pities, and protects their cause. \nMeantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies: \nCare seiz'd his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes. \nBut, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day, \nHe rose, the coast and country to survey, \nAnxious and eager to discover more. \nIt look'd a wild uncultivated shore; \nBut, whether humankind, or beasts alone \nPossess'd the new-found region, was unknown. \nBeneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides: \nTall trees surround the mountain's shady sides; \nThe bending brow above a safe retreat provides. \nArm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends, \nAnd true Achates on his steps attends. \nLo! in the deep recesses of the wood, \nBefore his eyes his goddess mother stood: \nA huntress in her habit and her mien; \nHer dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen. \nBare were her knees, and knots her garments bind; \nLoose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind; \nHer hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind. \nShe seem'd a virgin of the Spartan blood: \nWith such array Harpalyce bestrode \nHer Thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood. \n\"Ho, strangers! have you lately seen,\" she said, \n\"One of my sisters, like myself array'd, \nWho cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd? \nA painted quiver at her back she bore; \nVaried with spots, a lynx's hide she wore; \nAnd at full cry pursued the tusky boar.\" \nThus Venus: thus her son replied again: \n\"None of your sisters have we heard or seen, \nO virgin! or what other name you bear \nAbove that style- O more than mortal fair! \nYour voice and mien celestial birth betray! \nIf, as you seem, the sister of the day, \nOr one at least of chaste Diana's train, \nLet not an humble suppliant sue in vain; \nBut tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd, \nWhat earth we tread, and who commands the coast? \nThen on your name shall wretched mortals call, \nAnd offer'd victims at your altars fall.\" \n\"I dare not,\" she replied, \"assume the name \nOf goddess, or celestial honors claim: \nFor Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear, \nAnd purple buskins o'er their ankles wear. \nKnow, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are- \nA people rude in peace, and rough in war. \nThe rising city, which from far you see, \nIs Carthage, and a Tyrian colony. \nPhoenician Dido rules the growing state, \nWho fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate. \nGreat were her wrongs, her story full of fate; \nWhich I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known \nFor wealth, and brother to the Punic throne, \nPossess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart \nAt once was wounded with an equal dart. \nHer father gave her, yet a spotless maid; \nPygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd: \nOne who condemn'd divine and human laws. \nThen strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. \nThe monarch, blinded with desire of wealth, \nWith steel invades his brother's life by stealth; \nBefore the sacred altar made him bleed, \nAnd long from her conceal'd the cruel deed. \nSome tale, some new pretense, he daily coin'd, \nTo soothe his sister, and delude her mind. \nAt length, in dead of night, the ghost appears \nOf her unhappy lord: the specter stares, \nAnd, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. \nThe cruel altars and his fate he tells, \nAnd the dire secret of his house reveals, \nThen warns the widow, with her household gods, \nTo seek a refuge in remote abodes. \nLast, to support her in so long a way, \nHe shows her where his hidden treasure lay. \nAdmonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright, \nThe queen provides companions of her flight: \nThey meet, and all combine to leave the state, \nWho hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate. \nThey seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find; \nNor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind. \nThe vessels, heavy laden, put to sea \nWith prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way. \nI know not, if by stress of weather driv'n, \nOr was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n; \nAt last they landed, where from far your eyes \nMay view the turrets of new Carthage rise; \nThere bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa call'd, \nFrom the bull's hide) they first inclos'd, and wall'd. \nBut whence are you? what country claims your birth? \nWhat seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?\" \nTo whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes, \nAnd deeply sighing, thus her son replies: \n\"Could you with patience hear, or I relate, \nO nymph, the tedious annals of our fate! \nThro' such a train of woes if I should run, \nThe day would sooner than the tale be done! \nFrom ancient Troy, by force expell'd, we came- \nIf you by chance have heard the Trojan name. \nOn various seas by various tempests toss'd, \nAt length we landed on your Libyan coast. \nThe good Aeneas am I call'd- a name, \nWhile Fortune favor'd, not unknown to fame. \nMy household gods, companions of my woes, \nWith pious care I rescued from our foes. \nTo fruitful Italy my course was bent; \nAnd from the King of Heav'n is my descent. \nWith twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea; \nFate and my mother goddess led my way. \nScarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet, \nFrom storms preserv'd, within your harbor meet. \nMyself distress'd, an exile, and unknown, \nDebarr'd from Europe, and from Asia thrown, \nIn Libyan desarts wander thus alone.\" \nHis tender parent could no longer bear; \nBut, interposing, sought to soothe his care. \n\"Whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by Heav'n, \nSince on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n- \nHave courage: to the gods permit the rest, \nAnd to the queen expose your just request. \nNow take this earnest of success, for more: \nYour scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore; \nThe winds are chang'd, your friends from danger free; \nOr I renounce my skill in augury. \nTwelve swans behold in beauteous order move, \nAnd stoop with closing pinions from above; \nWhom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along, \nAnd thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng: \nNow, all united in a goodly team, \nThey skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream. \nAs they, with joy returning, clap their wings, \nAnd ride the circuit of the skies in rings; \nNot otherwise your ships, and ev'ry friend, \nAlready hold the port, or with swift sails descend. \nNo more advice is needful; but pursue \nThe path before you, and the town in view.\" \nThus having said, she turn'd, and made appear \nHer neck refulgent, and dishevel'd hair, \nWhich, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground. \nAnd widely spread ambrosial scents around: \nIn length of train descends her sweeping gown; \nAnd, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known. \nThe prince pursued the parting deity \nWith words like these: \"Ah! whither do you fly? \nUnkind and cruel! to deceive your son \nIn borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun; \nNever to bless my sight, but thus unknown; \nAnd still to speak in accents not your own.\" \nAgainst the goddess these complaints he made, \nBut took the path, and her commands obey'd. \nThey march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds \nWith mists their persons, and involves in clouds, \nThat, thus unseen, their passage none might stay, \nOr force to tell the causes of their way. \nThis part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime \nTo visit Paphos and her native clime; \nWhere garlands, ever green and ever fair, \nWith vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r: \nA hundred altars in her temple smoke; \nA thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke. \nThey climb the next ascent, and, looking down, \nNow at a nearer distance view the town. \nThe prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs, \nWhich late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs, \nThe gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part, \nThe noise and busy concourse of the mart. \nThe toiling Tyrians on each other call \nTo ply their labor: some extend the wall; \nSome build the citadel; the brawny throng \nOr dig, or push unwieldly stones along. \nSome for their dwellings choose a spot of ground, \nWhich, first design'd, with ditches they surround. \nSome laws ordain; and some attend the choice \nOf holy senates, and elect by voice. \nHere some design a mole, while others there \nLay deep foundations for a theater; \nFrom marble quarries mighty columns hew, \nFor ornaments of scenes, and future view. \nSuch is their toil, and such their busy pains, \nAs exercise the bees in flow'ry plains, \nWhen winter past, and summer scarce begun, \nInvites them forth to labor in the sun; \nSome lead their youth abroad, while some condense \nTheir liquid store, and some in cells dispense; \nSome at the gate stand ready to receive \nThe golden burthen, and their friends relieve; \nAll with united force, combine to drive \nThe lazy drones from the laborious hive: \nWith envy stung, they view each other's deeds; \nThe fragrant work with diligence proceeds. \n\"Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!\" \nAeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes, \nTheir lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate, \nConceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate) \nHe mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng, \nBorne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along. \nFull in the center of the town there stood, \nThick set with trees, a venerable wood. \nThe Tyrians, landing near this holy ground, \nAnd digging here, a prosp'rous omen found: \nFrom under earth a courser's head they drew, \nTheir growth and future fortune to foreshew. \nThis fated sign their foundress Juno gave, \nOf a soil fruitful, and a people brave. \nSidonian Dido here with solemn state \nDid Juno's temple build, and consecrate, \nEnrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine; \nBut more the goddess made the place divine. \nOn brazen steps the marble threshold rose, \nAnd brazen plates the cedar beams inclose: \nThe rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd; \nThe lofty doors on brazen hinges sound. \nWhat first Aeneas this place beheld, \nReviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd. \nFor while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd \nHis wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd, \nAdmir'd the fortune of the rising town, \nThe striving artists, and their arts' renown; \nHe saw, in order painted on the wall, \nWhatever did unhappy Troy befall: \nThe wars that fame around the world had blown, \nAll to the life, and ev'ry leader known. \nThere Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies, \nAnd fierce Achilles, who both kings defies. \nHe stopp'd, and weeping said: \"O friend! ev'n here \nThe monuments of Trojan woes appear! \nOur known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands: \nSee there, where old unhappy Priam stands! \nEv'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame, \nAnd Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim.\" \nHe said (his tears a ready passage find), \nDevouring what he saw so well design'd, \nAnd with an empty picture fed his mind: \nFor there he saw the fainting Grecians yield, \nAnd here the trembling Trojans quit the field, \nPursued by fierce Achilles thro' the plain, \nOn his high chariot driving o'er the slain. \nThe tents of Rhesus next his grief renew, \nBy their white sails betray'd to nightly view; \nAnd wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword \nThe sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord, \nThen took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food \nOf Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood. \nElsewhere he saw where Troilus defied \nAchilles, and unequal combat tried; \nThen, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins, \nWas by his horses hurried o'er the plains, \nHung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around: \nThe hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound, \nWith tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground. \nMeantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe, \nTo Pallas' fane in long procession go, \nIn hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe. \nThey weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,\n\nAnd rich embroider'd vests for presents bear; \nBut the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r. \nThrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew \nThe corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew. \nHere Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold, \nThe lifeless body of his son is sold. \nSo sad an object, and so well express'd, \nDrew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast, \nTo see the figure of his lifeless friend, \nAnd his old sire his helpless hand extend. \nHimself he saw amidst the Grecian train, \nMix'd in the bloody battle on the plain; \nAnd swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew, \nHis pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew. \nPenthisilea there, with haughty grace, \nLeads to the wars an Amazonian race: \nIn their right hands a pointed dart they wield; \nThe left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield. \nAthwart her breast a golden belt she throws, \nAmidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes, \nAnd dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose. \nThus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes, \nFix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise, \nThe beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train \nAnd pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane. \nSuch on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height, \nDiana seems; and so she charms the sight, \nWhen in the dance the graceful goddess leads \nThe choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads: \nKnown by her quiver, and her lofty mien, \nShe walks majestic, and she looks their queen; \nLatona sees her shine above the rest, \nAnd feeds with secret joy her silent breast. \nSuch Dido was; with such becoming state, \nAmidst the crowd, she walks serenely great. \nTheir labor to her future sway she speeds, \nAnd passing with a gracious glance proceeds; \nThen mounts the throne, high plac'd before the shrine: \nIn crowds around, the swarming people join. \nShe takes petitions, and dispenses laws, \nHears and determines ev'ry private cause; \nTheir tasks in equal portions she divides, \nAnd, where unequal, there by lots decides. \nAnother way by chance Aeneas bends \nHis eyes, and unexpected sees his friends, \nAntheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong, \nAnd at their backs a mighty Trojan throng, \nWhom late the tempest on the billows toss'd, \nAnd widely scatter'd on another coast. \nThe prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands, \nAnd longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands; \nBut, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays, \nAnd from the hollow cloud his friends surveys, \nImpatient till they told their present state, \nAnd where they left their ships, and what their fate, \nAnd why they came, and what was their request; \nFor these were sent, commission'd by the rest, \nTo sue for leave to land their sickly men, \nAnd gain admission to the gracious queen. \nEnt'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane; \nThen thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began: \n\"O queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods \nTo found an empire in these new abodes, \nTo build a town, with statutes to restrain \nThe wild inhabitants beneath thy reign, \nWe wretched Trojans, toss'd on ev'ry shore, \nFrom sea to sea, thy clemency implore. \nForbid the fires our shipping to deface! \nReceive th' unhappy fugitives to grace, \nAnd spare the remnant of a pious race! \nWe come not with design of wasteful prey, \nTo drive the country, force the swains away: \nNor such our strength, nor such is our desire; \nThe vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire. \nA land there is, Hesperia nam'd of old; \nThe soil is fruitful, and the men are bold- \nTh' Oenotrians held it once- by common fame \nNow call'd Italia, from the leader's name. \nTo that sweet region was our voyage bent, \nWhen winds and ev'ry warring element \nDisturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land, \nCast our torn vessels on the moving sand: \nThe sea came on; the South, with mighty roar, \nDispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore. \nThose few you see escap'd the Storm, and fear, \nUnless you interpose, a shipwreck here. \nWhat men, what monsters, what inhuman race, \nWhat laws, what barb'rous customs of the place, \nShut up a desart shore to drowning men, \nAnd drive us to the cruel seas again? \nIf our hard fortune no compassion draws, \nNor hospitable rights, nor human laws, \nThe gods are just, and will revenge our cause. \nAeneas was our prince: a juster lord, \nOr nobler warrior, never drew a sword; \nObservant of the right, religious of his word. \nIf yet he lives, and draws this vital air, \nNor we, his friends, of safety shall despair; \nNor you, great queen, these offices repent, \nWhich he will equal, and perhaps augment. \nWe want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts, \nWhere King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts. \nPermit our ships a shelter on your shores, \nRefitted from your woods with planks and oars, \nThat, if our prince be safe, we may renew \nOur destin'd course, and Italy pursue. \nBut if, O best of men, the Fates ordain \nThat thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main, \nAnd if our young Iulus be no more, \nDismiss our navy from your friendly shore, \nThat we to good Acestes may return, \nAnd with our friends our common losses mourn.\" \nThus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew \nWith cries and clamors his request renew. \nThe modest queen a while, with downcast eyes, \nPonder'd the speech; then briefly thus replies: \n\"Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate, \nAnd doubts attending an unsettled state, \nForce me to guard my coast from foreign foes. \nWho has not heard the story of your woes, \nThe name and fortune of your native place, \nThe fame and valor of the Phrygian race? \nWe Tyrians are not so devoid of sense, \nNor so remote from Phoebus' influence. \nWhether to Latian shores your course is bent, \nOr, driv'n by tempests from your first intent, \nYou seek the good Acestes' government, \nYour men shall be receiv'd, your fleet repair'd, \nAnd sail, with ships of convoy for your guard: \nOr, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs \nTo raise and to defend the Tyrian tow'rs, \nMy wealth, my city, and myself are yours. \nAnd would to Heav'n, the Storm, you felt, would bring \nOn Carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king. \nMy people shall, by my command, explore \nThe ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore, \nAnd towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest \nOf so renown'd and so desir'd a guest.\" \nRais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood, \nAnd long'd to break from out his ambient cloud: \nAchates found it, and thus urg'd his way: \n\"From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay? \nWhat more can you desire, your welcome sure, \nYour fleet in safety, and your friends secure? \nOne only wants; and him we saw in vain \nOppose the Storm, and swallow'd in the main. \nOrontes in his fate our forfeit paid; \nThe rest agrees with what your mother said.\" \nScarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way, \nThe mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day. \nThe Trojan chief appear'd in open sight, \nAugust in visage, and serenely bright. \nHis mother goddess, with her hands divine, \nHad form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine,\n\nAnd giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace, \nAnd breath'd a youthful vigor on his face; \nLike polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold, \nOr Parian marble, when enchas'd in gold: \nThus radiant from the circling cloud he broke, \nAnd thus with manly modesty he spoke: \n\"He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd, \nAnd sav'd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast; \nPresenting, gracious queen, before your throne, \nA prince that owes his life to you alone. \nFair majesty, the refuge and redress \nOf those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress, \nYou, who your pious offices employ \nTo save the relics of abandon'd Troy; \nReceive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore, \nWith hospitable rites relieve the poor; \nAssociate in your town a wand'ring train, \nAnd strangers in your palace entertain: \nWhat thanks can wretched fugitives return, \nWho, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile mourn? \nThe gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd; \nIf acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind, \nAnd, more than all the gods, your gen'rous heart. \nConscious of worth, requite its own desert! \nIn you this age is happy, and this earth, \nAnd parents more than mortal gave you birth. \nWhile rolling rivers into seas shall run, \nAnd round the space of heav'n the radiant sun; \nWhile trees the mountain tops with shades supply, \nYour honor, name, and praise shall never die. \nWhate'er abode my fortune has assign'd, \nYour image shall be present in my mind.\" \nThus having said, he turn'd with pious haste, \nAnd joyful his expecting friends embrac'd: \nWith his right hand Ilioneus was grac'd, \nSerestus with his left; then to his breast \nCloanthus and the noble Gyas press'd; \nAnd so by turns descended to the rest. \nThe Tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face, \nPleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace; \nAdmir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man; \nThen recollected stood, and thus began: \n\"What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow'rs \nHave cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores? \nAre you the great Aeneas, known to fame, \nWho from celestial seed your lineage claim? \nThe same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore \nTo fam'd Anchises on th' Idaean shore? \nIt calls into my mind, tho' then a child, \nWhen Teucer came, from Salamis exil'd, \nAnd sought my father's aid, to be restor'd: \nMy father Belus then with fire and sword \nInvaded Cyprus, made the region bare, \nAnd, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful war. \nFrom him the Trojan siege I understood, \nThe Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood. \nYour foe himself the Dardan valor prais'd, \nAnd his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd. \nEnter, my noble guest, and you shall find, \nIf not a costly welcome, yet a kind: \nFor I myself, like you, have been distress'd, \nTill Heav'n afforded me this place of rest; \nLike you, an alien in a land unknown, \nI learn to pity woes so like my own.\" \nShe said, and to the palace led her guest; \nThen offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast. \nNor yet less careful for her absent friends, \nTwice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends; \nBesides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs, \nWith bleating cries, attend their milky dams; \nAnd jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls \nShe gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls. \nNow purple hangings clothe the palace walls, \nAnd sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls: \nOn Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine; \nWith loads of massy plate the sideboards shine, \nAnd antique vases, all of gold emboss'd \n(The gold itself inferior to the cost), \nOf curious work, where on the sides were seen \nThe fights and figures of illustrious men, \nFrom their first founder to the present queen. \nThe good Aeneas, paternal care \nIulus' absence could no longer bear, \nDispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste, \nTo give a glad relation of the past, \nAnd, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy, \nSnatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy: \nA robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire; \nAn upper vest, once Helen's rich attire, \nFrom Argos by the fam'd adultress brought, \nWith golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought, \nHer mother Leda's present, when she came \nTo ruin Troy and set the world on flame; \nThe scepter Priam's eldest daughter bore, \nHer orient necklace, and the crown she wore \nOf double texture, glorious to behold, \nOne order set with gems, and one with gold. \nInstructed thus, the wise Achates goes, \nAnd in his diligence his duty shows. \nBut Venus, anxious for her son's affairs, \nNew counsels tries, and new designs prepares: \nThat Cupid should assume the shape and face \nOf sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace; \nShould bring the presents, in her nephew's stead, \nAnd in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed: \nFor much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued, \nAnd knew the town to Juno's care belong'd. \nThese thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke, \nAnd thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke: \n\"My son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone \nControls the Thund'rer on his awful throne, \nTo thee thy much-afflicted mother flies, \nAnd on thy succor and thy faith relies. \nThou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife, \nBy force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life; \nAnd often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains. \nHim Dido now with blandishment detains; \nBut I suspect the town where Juno reigns. \nFor this 't is needful to prevent her art, \nAnd fire with love the proud Phoenician's heart: \nA love so violent, so strong, so sure, \nAs neither age can change, nor art can cure. \nHow this may be perform'd, now take my mind: \nAscanius by his father is design'd \nTo come, with presents laden, from the port, \nTo gratify the queen, and gain the court. \nI mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep, \nAnd, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep, \nOr high Cythera, that the sweet deceit \nMay pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat. \nTake thou his form and shape. I beg the grace \nBut only for a night's revolving space: \nThyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face; \nThat when, amidst the fervor of the feast, \nThe Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast, \nAnd with sweet kisses in her arms constrains, \nThou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins.\" \nThe God of Love obeys, and sets aside \nHis bow and quiver, and his plumy pride; \nHe walks Iulus in his mother's sight, \nAnd in the sweet resemblance takes delight. \nThe goddess then to young Ascanius flies, \nAnd in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes: \nLull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves, \nShe gently bears him to her blissful groves, \nThen with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head, \nAnd softly lays him on a flow'ry bed. \nCupid meantime assum'd his form and face, \nFoll'wing Achates with a shorter pace, \nAnd brought the gifts. The queen already sate \nAmidst the Trojan lords, in shining state, \nHigh on a golden bed: her princely guest \nWas next her side; in order sate the rest. \nThen canisters with bread are heap'd on high; \nTh' attendants water for their hands supply, \nAnd, having wash'd, with silken towels dry. \nNext fifty handmaids in long order bore \nThe censers, and with fumes the gods adore: \nThen youths, and virgins twice as many, join \nTo place the dishes, and to serve the wine. \nThe Tyrian train, admitted to the feast, \nApproach, and on the painted couches rest. \nAll on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze, \nBut view the beauteous boy with more amaze, \nHis rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant eyes, \nHis motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise;\n\nNor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine, \nWhich wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine. \nBut, far above the rest, the royal dame, \n(Already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,) \nWith eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy, \nBeholds the presents, and admires the boy. \nThe guileful god about the hero long, \nWith children's play, and false embraces, hung; \nThen sought the queen: she took him to her arms \nWith greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms. \nUnhappy Dido little thought what guest, \nHow dire a god, she drew so near her breast; \nBut he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r, \nWorks in the pliant bosom of the fair, \nAnd molds her heart anew, and blots her former care. \nThe dead is to the living love resign'd; \nAnd all Aeneas enters in her mind. \nNow, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd, \nThe meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd, \nThe golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd, \nAnd thro' the palace cheerful cries resound. \nFrom gilded roofs depending lamps display \nNocturnal beams, that emulate the day. \nA golden bowl, that shone with gems divine, \nThe queen commanded to be crown'd with wine: \nThe bowl that Belus us'd, and all the Tyrian line. \nThen, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke: \n\"O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke, \nWith solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r; \nBless to both nations this auspicious hour! \nSo may the Trojan and the Tyrian line \nIn lasting concord from this day combine. \nThou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer, \nAnd gracious Juno, both be present here! \nAnd you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address \nTo Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace.\" \nThe goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd \n(Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,) \nAnd rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace; \nThen, sipping, offer'd to the next in place. \n'T was Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul; \nHe took challenge, and embrac'd the bowl, \nWith pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw, \nTill he the bottom of the brimmer saw. \nThe goblet goes around: Iopas brought \nHis golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught: \nThe various labors of the wand'ring moon, \nAnd whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun; \nTh' original of men and beasts; and whence \nThe rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense, \nAnd fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence; \nWhat shakes the solid earth; what cause delays \nThe summer nights and shortens winter days. \nWith peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song: \nThose peals are echo'd by the Trojan throng. \nTh' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night, \nAnd drank large draughts of love with vast delight; \nOf Priam much enquir'd, of Hector more; \nThen ask'd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore, \nWhat troops he landed on the Trojan shore; \nThe steeds of Diomede varied the discourse, \nAnd fierce Achilles, with his matchless force; \nAt length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd, \nTo hear the series of the war desir'd. \n\"Relate at large, my godlike guest,\" she said, \n\"The Grecian stratagems, the town betray'd: \nThe fatal issue of so long a war, \nYour flight, your wand'rings, and your woes, declare; \nFor, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast, \nYour men have been distress'd, your navy toss'd, \nSev'n times the sun has either tropic view'd, \nThe winter banish'd, and the spring renew'd.\" \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK II\n\nAll were attentive to the godlike man, \nWhen from his lofty couch he thus began: \n\"Great queen, what you command me to relate \nRenews the sad remembrance of our fate: \nAn empire from its old foundations rent, \nAnd ev'ry woe the Trojans underwent; \nA peopled city made a desart place; \nAll that I saw, and part of which I was: \nNot ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear, \nNor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. \nAnd now the latter watch of wasting night, \nAnd setting stars, to kindly rest invite; \nBut, since you take such int'rest in our woe, \nAnd Troy's disastrous end desire to know, \nI will restrain my tears, and briefly tell \nWhat in our last and fatal night befell. \n\"By destiny compell'd, and in despair, \nThe Greeks grew weary of the tedious war, \nAnd by Minerva's aid a fabric rear'd, \nWhich like a steed of monstrous height appear'd: \nThe sides were plank'd with pine; they feign'd it made \nFor their return, and this the vow they paid. \nThus they pretend, but in the hollow side \nSelected numbers of their soldiers hide: \nWith inward arms the dire machine they load, \nAnd iron bowels stuff the dark abode. \nIn sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle \n(While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile) \nRenown'd for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay, \nWhere ships expos'd to wind and weather lay. \nThere was their fleet conceal'd. We thought, for Greece \nTheir sails were hoisted, and our fears release. \nThe Trojans, coop'd within their walls so long, \nUnbar their gates, and issue in a throng, \nLike swarming bees, and with delight survey \nThe camp deserted, where the Grecians lay: \nThe quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd; \nHere Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode; \nHere join'd the battles; there the navy rode. \nPart on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ: \nThe pile by Pallas rais'd to ruin Troy. \nThymoetes first ('t is doubtful whether hir'd, \nOr so the Trojan destiny requir'd) \nMov'd that the ramparts might be broken down, \nTo lodge the monster fabric in the town. \nBut Capys, and the rest of sounder mind, \nThe fatal present to the flames designed, \nOr to the wat'ry deep; at least to bore \nThe hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore. \nThe giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide, \nWith noise say nothing, and in parts divide. \nLaocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd, \nRan from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud: \n'O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns? \nWhat more than madness has possess'd your brains? \nThink you the Grecians from your coasts are gone? \nAnd are Ulysses' arts no better known? \nThis hollow fabric either must inclose, \nWithin its blind recess, our secret foes; \nOr 't is an engine rais'd above the town, \nT' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down. \nSomewhat is sure design'd, by fraud or force: \nTrust not their presents, nor admit the horse.' \nThus having said, against the steed he threw \nHis forceful spear, which, hissing as flew, \nPierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood, \nAnd trembling in the hollow belly stood. \nThe sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound, \nAnd groans of Greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound\n\nAnd, had not Heav'n the fall of Troy design'd, \nOr had not men been fated to be blind, \nEnough was said and done t'inspire a better mind. \nThen had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood, \nAnd Ilian tow'rs and Priam's empire stood. \nMeantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring \nA captive Greek, in bands, before the king; \nTaken to take; who made himself their prey, \nT' impose on their belief, and Troy betray; \nFix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent \nTo die undaunted, or to circumvent. \nAbout the captive, tides of Trojans flow; \nAll press to see, and some insult the foe. \nNow hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis'd; \nBehold a nation in a man compris'd. \nTrembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd and bound; \nHe star'd, and roll'd his haggard eyes around, \nThen said: 'Alas! what earth remains, what sea \nIs open to receive unhappy me? \nWhat fate a wretched fugitive attends, \nScorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?' \nHe said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye: \nOur pity kindles, and our passions die. \nWe cheer youth to make his own defense, \nAnd freely tell us what he was, and whence: \nWhat news he could impart, we long to know, \nAnd what to credit from a captive foe. \n\"His fear at length dismiss'd, he said: 'Whate'er \nMy fate ordains, my words shall be sincere: \nI neither can nor dare my birth disclaim; \nGreece is my country, Sinon is my name. \nTho' plung'd by Fortune's pow'r in misery, \n'T is not in Fortune's pow'r to make me lie. \nIf any chance has hither brought the name \nOf Palamedes, not unknown to fame, \nWho suffer'd from the malice of the times, \nAccus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes, \nBecause these fatal wars he would prevent; \nWhose death the wretched Greeks too late lament- \nMe, then a boy, my father, poor and bare \nOf other means, committed to his care, \nHis kinsman and companion in the war. \nWhile Fortune favor'd, while his arms support \nThe cause, and rul'd the counsels, of the court, \nI made some figure there; nor was my name \nObscure, nor I without my share of fame. \nBut when Ulysses, with fallacious arts, \nHad made impression in the people's hearts, \nAnd forg'd a treason in my patron's name \n(I speak of things too far divulg'd by fame), \nMy kinsman fell. Then I, without support, \nIn private mourn'd his loss, and left the court. \nMad as I was, I could not bear his fate \nWith silent grief, but loudly blam'd the state, \nAnd curs'd the direful author of my woes. \n'T was told again; and hence my ruin rose. \nI threaten'd, if indulgent Heav'n once more \nWould land me safely on my native shore, \nHis death with double vengeance to restore. \nThis mov'd the murderer's hate; and soon ensued \nTh' effects of malice from a man so proud. \nAmbiguous rumors thro' the camp he spread, \nAnd sought, by treason, my devoted head; \nNew crimes invented; left unturn'd no stone, \nTo make my guilt appear, and hide his own; \nTill Calchas was by force and threat'ning wrought- \nBut why- why dwell I on that anxious thought? \nIf on my nation just revenge you seek, \nAnd 't is t' appear a foe, t' appear a Greek; \nAlready you my name and country know; \nAssuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow: \nMy death will both the kingly brothers please, \nAnd set insatiate Ithacus at ease.' \nThis fair unfinish'd tale, these broken starts, \nRais'd expectations in our longing hearts: \nUnknowing as we were in Grecian arts. \nHis former trembling once again renew'd, \nWith acted fear, the villain thus pursued: \n\"'Long had the Grecians (tir'd with fruitless care, \nAnd wearied with an unsuccessful war) \nResolv'd to raise the siege, and leave the town; \nAnd, had the gods permitted, they had gone; \nBut oft the wintry seas and southern winds \nWithstood their passage home, and chang'd their minds. \nPortents and prodigies their souls amaz'd; \nBut most, when this stupendous pile was rais'd: \nThen flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen, \nAnd thunders rattled thro' a sky serene. \nDismay'd, and fearful of some dire event, \nEurypylus t' enquire their fate was sent. \nHe from the gods this dreadful answer brought: \n\"O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought, \nYour passage with a virgin's blood was bought: \nSo must your safe return be bought again, \nAnd Grecian blood once more atone the main.\" \nThe spreading rumor round the people ran; \nAll fear'd, and each believ'd himself the man. \nUlysses took th' advantage of their fright; \nCall'd Calchas, and produc'd in open sight: \nThen bade him name the wretch, ordain'd by fate \nThe public victim, to redeem the state. \nAlready some presag'd the dire event, \nAnd saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant. \nFor twice five days the good old seer withstood \nTh' intended treason, and was dumb to blood, \nTill, tir'd, with endless clamors and pursuit \nOf Ithacus, he stood no longer mute; \nBut, as it was agreed, pronounc'd that I \nWas destin'd by the wrathful gods to die. \nAll prais'd the sentence, pleas'd the storm should fall \nOn one alone, whose fury threaten'd all. \nThe dismal day was come; the priests prepare \nTheir leaven'd cakes, and fillets for my hair. \nI follow'd nature's laws, and must avow \nI broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow. \nHid in a weedy lake all night I lay, \nSecure of safety when they sail'd away. \nBut now what further hopes for me remain, \nTo see my friends, or native soil, again; \nMy tender infants, or my careful sire, \nWhom they returning will to death require; \nWill perpetrate on them their first design, \nAnd take the forfeit of their heads for mine? \nWhich, O! if pity mortal minds can move, \nIf there be faith below, or gods above, \nIf innocence and truth can claim desert, \nYe Trojans, from an injur'd wretch avert.' \n\"False tears true pity move; the king commands \nTo loose his fetters, and unbind his hands: \nThen adds these friendly words: 'Dismiss thy fears; \nForget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs. \nBut truly tell, was it for force or guile, \nOr some religious end, you rais'd the pile?' \nThus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts, \nThis well-invented tale for truth imparts: \n'Ye lamps of heav'n!' he said, and lifted high \nHis hands now free, 'thou venerable sky! \nInviolable pow'rs, ador'd with dread! \nYe fatal fillets, that once bound this head! \nYe sacred altars, from whose flames I fled! \nBe all of you adjur'd; and grant I may, \nWithout a crime, th' ungrateful Greeks betray, \nReveal the secrets of the guilty state, \nAnd justly punish whom I justly hate! \nBut you, O king, preserve the faith you gave, \nIf I, to save myself, your empire save. \nThe Grecian hopes, and all th' attempts they made, \nWere only founded on Minerva's aid. \nBut from the time when impious Diomede, \nAnd false Ulysses, that inventive head, \nHer fatal image from the temple drew, \nThe sleeping guardians of the castle slew, \nHer virgin statue with their bloody hands \nPolluted, and profan'd her holy bands; \nFrom thence the tide of fortune left their shore, \nAnd ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before: \nTheir courage languish'd, as their hopes decay'd; \nAnd Pallas, now averse, refus'd her aid. \nNor did the goddess doubtfully declare \nHer alter'd mind and alienated care. \nWhen first her fatal image touch'd the ground, \nShe sternly cast her glaring eyes around, \nThat sparkled as they roll'd, and seem'd to threat: \nHer heav'nly limbs distill'd a briny sweat. \nThrice from the ground she leap'd, was seen to wield \nHer brandish'd lance, and shake her horrid shield. \nThen Calchas bade our host for flight \nAnd hope no conquest from the tedious war, \nTill first they sail'd for Greece; with pray'rs besought\n\nHer injur'd pow'r, and better omens brought. \nAnd now their navy plows the wat'ry main, \nYet soon expect it on your shores again, \nWith Pallas pleas'd; as Calchas did ordain. \nBut first, to reconcile the blue-ey'd maid \nFor her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd, \nWarn'd by the seer, to her offended name \nWe rais'd and dedicate this wondrous frame, \nSo lofty, lest thro' your forbidden gates \nIt pass, and intercept our better fates: \nFor, once admitted there, our hopes are lost; \nAnd Troy may then a new Palladium boast; \nFor so religion and the gods ordain, \nThat, if you violate with hands profane \nMinerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn, \n(Which omen, O ye gods, on Graecia turn!) \nBut if it climb, with your assisting hands, \nThe Trojan walls, and in the city stands; \nThen Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn, \nAnd the reverse of fate on us return.' \n\"With such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts, \nToo prone to credit his perfidious arts. \nWhat Diomede, nor Thetis' greater son, \nA thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done- \nFalse tears and fawning words the city won. \n\"A greater omen, and of worse portent, \nDid our unwary minds with fear torment, \nConcurring to produce the dire event. \nLaocoon, Neptune's priest by lot that year, \nWith solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer; \nWhen, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied \nTwo serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide, \nAnd smoothly sweep along the swelling tide. \nTheir flaming crests above the waves they show; \nTheir bellies seem to burn the seas below; \nTheir speckled tails advance to steer their course, \nAnd on the sounding shore the flying billows force. \nAnd now the strand, and now the plain they held; \nTheir ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd; \nTheir nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came, \nAnd lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame. \nWe fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take, \nAnd to Laocoon and his children make; \nAnd first around the tender boys they wind, \nThen with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies grind.\n\nThe wretched father, running to their aid \nWith pious haste, but vain, they next invade; \nTwice round his waist their winding volumes roll'd; \nAnd twice about his gasping throat they fold. \nThe priest thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide, \nAnd tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride. \nWith both his hands he labors at the knots; \nHis holy fillets the blue venom blots; \nHis roaring fills the flitting air around. \nThus, when an ox receives a glancing wound, \nHe breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies, \nAnd with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies. \nTheir tasks perform'd, the serpents quit their prey, \nAnd to the tow'r of Pallas make their way: \nCouch'd at her feet, they lie protected there \nBy her large buckler and protended spear. \nAmazement seizes all; the gen'ral cry \nProclaims Laocoon justly doom'd to die, \nWhose hand the will of Pallas had withstood, \nAnd dared to violate the sacred wood. \nAll vote t' admit the steed, that vows be paid \nAnd incense offer'd to th' offended maid. \nA spacious breach is made; the town lies bare; \nSome hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare \nAnd fasten to the horse's feet; the rest \nWith cables haul along th' unwieldly beast. \nEach on his fellow for assistance calls; \nAt length the fatal fabric mounts the walls, \nBig with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown'd, \nAnd choirs of virgins, sing and dance around. \nThus rais'd aloft, and then descending down, \nIt enters o'er our heads, and threats the town. \nO sacred city, built by hands divine! \nO valiant heroes of the Trojan line! \nFour times he struck: as oft the clashing sound \nOf arms was heard, and inward groans rebound. \nYet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate, \nWe haul along the horse in solemn state; \nThen place the dire portent within the tow'r. \nCassandra cried, and curs'd th' unhappy hour; \nForetold our fate; but, by the god's decree, \nAll heard, and none believ'd the prophecy. \nWith branches we the fanes adorn, and waste, \nIn jollity, the day ordain'd to be the last. \nMeantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the light, \nAnd on the shaded ocean rush'd the night; \nOur men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held, \nBut easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd. \nThe Grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs \nFrom Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores, \nSafe under covert of the silent night, \nAnd guided by th' imperial galley's light; \nWhen Sinon, favor'd by the partial gods, \nUnlock'd the horse, and op'd his dark abodes; \nRestor'd to vital air our hidden foes, \nWho joyful from their long confinement rose. \nTysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide, \nAnd dire Ulysses down the cable slide: \nThen Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste; \nNor was the Podalirian hero last, \nNor injur'd Menelaus, nor the fam'd \nEpeus, who the fatal engine fram'd. \nA nameless crowd succeed; their forces join \nT' invade the town, oppress'd with sleep and wine. \nThose few they find awake first meet their fate; \nThen to their fellows they unbar the gate. \n\"'T was in the dead of night, when sleep repairs \nOur bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares, \nWhen Hector's ghost before my sight appears: \nA bloody shroud he seem'd, and bath'd in tears; \nSuch as he was, when, by Pelides slain, \nThessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain. \nSwoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust \nThro' the bor'd holes; his body black with dust; \nUnlike that Hector who return'd from toils \nOf war, triumphant, in Aeacian spoils, \nOr him who made the fainting Greeks retire, \nAnd launch'd against their navy Phrygian fire. \nHis hair and beard stood stiffen'd with his gore; \nAnd all the wounds he for his country bore \nNow stream'd afresh, and with new purple ran. \nI wept to see the visionary man, \nAnd, while my trance continued, thus began: \n'O light of Trojans, and support of Troy, \nThy father's champion, and thy country's joy! \nO, long expected by thy friends! from whence \nArt thou so late return'd for our defense? \nDo we behold thee, wearied as we are \nWith length of labors, and with toils of war? \nAfter so many fun'rals of thy own \nArt thou restor'd to thy declining town? \nBut say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace \nDeforms the manly features of thy face?' \n\"To this the specter no reply did frame, \nBut answer'd to the cause for which he came, \nAnd, groaning from the bottom of his breast, \nThis warning in these mournful words express'd: \n'O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight, \nThe flames and horrors of this fatal night. \nThe foes already have possess'd the wall; \nTroy nods from high, and totters to her fall. \nEnough is paid to Priam's royal name, \nMore than enough to duty and to fame. \nIf by a mortal hand my father's throne \nCould be defended, 't was by mine alone. \nNow Troy to thee commends her future state, \nAnd gives her gods companions of thy fate: \nFrom their assistance walls expect, \nWhich, wand'ring long, at last thou shalt erect.' \nHe said, and brought me, from their blest abodes, \nThe venerable statues of the gods, \nWith ancient Vesta from the sacred choir, \nThe wreaths and relics of th' immortal fire. \n\"Now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar, \nCries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war: \nThe noise approaches, tho' our palace stood \nAloof from streets, encompass'd with a wood. \nLouder, and yet more loud, I hear th' alarms \nOf human cries distinct, and clashing arms. \nFear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay, \nBut mount the terrace, thence the town survey, \nAnd hearken what the frightful sounds convey. \nThus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne, \nCrackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn; \nOr deluges, descending on the plains, \nSweep o'er the yellow year, destroy the pains \nOf lab'ring oxen and the peasant's gains; \nUnroot the forest oaks, and bear away \nFlocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish'd prey: \nThe shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far \nThe wasteful ravage of the wat'ry war. \nThen Hector's faith was manifestly clear'd, \nAnd Grecian frauds in open light appear'd. \nThe palace of Deiphobus ascends \nIn smoky flames, and catches on his friends. \nUcalegon burns next: the seas are bright \nWith splendor not their own, and shine with Trojan light.\n\nNew clamors and new clangors now arise, \nThe sound of trumpets mix'd with fighting cries. \nWith frenzy seiz'd, I run to meet th' alarms, \nResolv'd on death, resolv'd to die in arms, \nBut first to gather friends, with them t' oppose \n(If fortune favor'd) and repel the foes; \nSpurr'd by my courage, by my country fir'd, \nWith sense of honor and revenge inspir'd. \n\"Pantheus, Apollo's priest, a sacred name, \nHad scap'd the Grecian swords, and pass'd the flame: \nWith relics loaden. to my doors he fled, \nAnd by the hand his tender grandson led. \n'What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run? \nWhere make a stand? and what may yet be done?' \nScarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan: \n'Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town! \nThe fatal day, th' appointed hour, is come, \nWhen wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom \nTransfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands. \nThe fire consumes the town, the foe commands; \nAnd armed hosts, an unexpected force, \nBreak from the bowels of the fatal horse. \nWithin the gates, proud Sinon throws about \nThe flames; and foes for entrance press without, \nWith thousand others, whom I fear to name, \nMore than from Argos or Mycenae came. \nTo sev'ral posts their parties they divide; \nSome block the narrow streets, some scour the wide: \nThe bold they kill, th' unwary they surprise; \nWho fights finds death, and death finds him who flies. \nThe warders of the gate but scarce maintain \nTh' unequal combat, and resist in vain.' \n\"I heard; and Heav'n, that well-born souls inspires, \nPrompts me thro' lifted swords and rising fires \nTo run where clashing arms and clamor calls, \nAnd rush undaunted to defend the walls. \nRipheus and Iph'itus by my side engage, \nFor valor one renown'd, and one for age. \nDymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew \nMy motions and my mien, and to my party drew; \nWith young Coroebus, who by love was led \nTo win renown and fair Cassandra's bed, \nAnd lately brought his troops to Priam's aid, \nForewarn'd in vain by the prophetic maid. \nWhom when I saw resolv'd in arms to fall, \nAnd that one spirit animated all: \n'Brave souls!' said I,- 'but brave, alas! in vain- \nCome, finish what our cruel fates ordain. \nYou see the desp'rate state of our affairs, \nAnd heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs. \nThe passive gods behold the Greeks defile \nTheir temples, and abandon to the spoil \nTheir own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire \nTo save a sinking town, involv'd in fire. \nThen let us fall, but fall amidst our foes: \nDespair of life the means of living shows.' \nSo bold a speech incourag'd their desire \nOf death, and added fuel to their fire. \n\"As hungry wolves, with raging appetite, \nScour thro' the fields, nor fear the stormy night- \nTheir whelps at home expect the promis'd food, \nAnd long to temper their dry chaps in blood- \nSo rush'd we forth at once; resolv'd to die, \nResolv'd, in death, the last extremes to try. \nWe leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare \nTh' unequal combat in the public square: \nNight was our friend; our leader was despair. \nWhat tongue can tell the slaughter of that night? \nWhat eyes can weep the sorrows and affright? \nAn ancient and imperial city falls: \nThe streets are fill'd with frequent funerals; \nHouses and holy temples float in blood, \nAnd hostile nations make a common flood. \nNot only Trojans fall; but, in their turn, \nThe vanquish'd triumph, and the victors mourn. \nOurs take new courage from despair and night: \nConfus'd the fortune is, confus'd the fight. \nAll parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears; \nAnd grisly Death in sundry shapes appears. \nAndrogeos fell among us, with his band, \nWho thought us Grecians newly come to land. \n'From whence,' said he, 'my friends, this long delay? \nYou loiter, while the spoils are borne away: \nOur ships are laden with the Trojan store; \nAnd you, like truants, come too late ashore.' \nHe said, but soon corrected his mistake, \nFound, by the doubtful answers which we make: \nAmaz'd, he would have shunn'd th' unequal fight; \nBut we, more num'rous, intercept his flight. \nAs when some peasant, in a bushy brake, \nHas with unwary footing press'd a snake; \nHe starts aside, astonish'd, when he spies \nHis rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes; \nSo from our arms surpris'd Androgeos flies. \nIn vain; for him and his we compass'd round, \nPossess'd with fear, unknowing of the ground, \nAnd of their lives an easy conquest found. \nThus Fortune on our first endeavor smil'd. \nCoroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil'd, \nSwoln with success, and a daring mind, \nThis new invention fatally design'd. \n'My friends,' said he, 'since Fortune shows the way, \n'T is fit we should th' auspicious guide obey. \nFor what has she these Grecian arms bestow'd, \nBut their destruction, and the Trojans' good? \nThen change we shields, and their devices bear: \nLet fraud supply the want of force in war. \nThey find us arms.' This said, himself he dress'd \nIn dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest, \nHis painted buckler, and his plumy crest. \nThus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train, \nLay down their own attire, and strip the slain. \nMix'd with the Greeks, we go with ill presage, \nFlatter'd with hopes to glut our greedy rage; \nUnknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet, \nAnd strew with Grecian carcasses the street. \nThus while their straggling parties we defeat, \nSome to the shore and safer ships retreat; \nAnd some, oppress'd with more ignoble fear, \nRemount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there. \n\"But, ah! what use of valor can be made, \nWhen heav'n's propitious pow'rs refuse their aid! \nBehold the royal prophetess, the fair \nCassandra, dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair, \nWhom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands, \nIn safety could protect from sacrilegious hands: \nOn heav'n she cast her eyes, she sigh'd, she cried- \n'T was all she could- her tender arms were tied. \nSo sad a sight Coroebus could not bear; \nBut, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair, \nAmid the barb'rous ravishers he flew: \nOur leader's rash example we pursue. \nBut storms of stones, from the proud temple's height, \nPour down, and on our batter'd helms alight: \nWe from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow, \nWho thought us Grecians, as we seem'd in show. \nThey aim at the mistaken crests, from high; \nAnd ours beneath the pond'rous ruin lie. \nThen, mov'd with anger and disdain, to see \nTheir troops dispers'd, the royal virgin free, \nThe Grecians rally, and their pow'rs unite, \nWith fury charge us, and renew the fight. \nThe brother kings with Ajax join their force, \nAnd the whole squadron of Thessalian horse. \n\"Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try, \nContending for the kingdom of the sky, \nSouth, east, and west, on airy coursers borne; \nThe whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn: \nThen Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise, \nAnd, mix'd with ooze and sand, pollute the skies. \nThe troops we squander'd first again appear \nFrom several quarters, and enclose the rear. \nThey first observe, and to the rest betray, \nOur diff'rent speech; our borrow'd arms survey. \nOppress'd with odds, we fall; Coroebus first, \nAt Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierc'd. \nThen Ripheus follow'd, in th' unequal fight; \nJust of his word, observant of the right: \nHeav'n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends, \nWith Hypanis, mistaken by their friends. \nNor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands \nOf awful Phoebus, sav'd from impious hands. \nYe Trojan flames, your testimony bear, \nWhat I perform'd, and what I suffer'd there; \nNo sword avoiding in the fatal strife, \nExpos'd to death, and prodigal of life; \nWitness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault: \nI strove to have deserv'd the death I sought. \nBut, when I could not fight, and would have died, \nBorne off to distance by the growing tide, \nOld Iphitus and I were hurried thence, \nWith Pelias wounded, and without defense. \nNew clamors from th' invested palace ring: \nWe run to die, or disengage the king. \nSo hot th' assault, so high the tumult rose, \nWhile ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose \nAs all the Dardan and Argolic race \nHad been contracted in that narrow space; \nOr as all Ilium else were void of fear, \nAnd tumult, war, and slaughter, only there. \nTheir targets in a tortoise cast, the foes, \nSecure advancing, to the turrets rose: \nSome mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold, \nSwerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold; \nTheir left hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent, \nWhile with their right they seize the battlement. \nFrom their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans throw \nHuge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe; \nAnd heavy beams and rafters from the sides \n(Such arms their last necessity provides) \nAnd gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high, \nThe marks of state and ancient royalty. \nThe guards below, fix'd in the pass, attend \nThe charge undaunted, and the gate defend. \nRenew'd in courage with recover'd breath, \nA second time we ran to tempt our death, \nTo clear the palace from the foe, succeed \nThe weary living, and revenge the dead. \n\"A postern door, yet unobserv'd and free, \nJoin'd by the length of a blind gallery, \nTo the king's closet led: a way well known \nTo Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne, \nThro' which she brought Astyanax, unseen, \nTo cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen. \nThro' this we pass, and mount the tow'r, from whence \nWith unavailing arms the Trojans make defense. \nFrom this the trembling king had oft descried \nThe Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride. \nBeams from its lofty height with swords we hew, \nThen, wrenching with our hands, th' assault renew; \nAnd, where the rafters on the columns meet, \nWe push them headlong with our arms and feet. \nThe lightning flies not swifter than the fall, \nNor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall: \nDown goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath \nAre piecemeal torn, or pounded into death. \nYet more succeed, and more to death are sent; \nWe cease not from above, nor they below relent. \nBefore the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat'ning loud, \nWith glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd. \nSo shines, renew'd in youth, the crested snake, \nWho slept the winter in a thorny brake, \nAnd, casting off his slough when spring returns, \nNow looks aloft, and with new glory burns; \nRestor'd with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides \nReflect the sun; and rais'd on spires he rides; \nHigh o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along, \nAnd brandishes by fits his forky tongue. \nProud Periphas, and fierce Automedon, \nHis father's charioteer, together run \nTo force the gate; the Scyrian infantry \nRush on in crowds, and the barr'd passage free. \nEnt'ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend; \nAnd flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend. \nHimself, among the foremost, deals his blows, \nAnd with his ax repeated strokes bestows \nOn the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply, \nTill from the posts the brazen hinges fly. \nHe hews apace; the double bars at length \nYield to his ax and unresisted strength. \nA mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal'd \nAppear, and all the palace is reveal'd; \nThe halls of audience, and of public state, \nAnd where the lonely queen in secret sate. \nArm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen, \nWith not a door, and scarce a space, between. \nThe house is fill'd with loud laments and cries, \nAnd shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies; \nThe fearful matrons run from place to place, \nAnd kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace. \nThe fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies, \nAnd all his father sparkles in his eyes; \nNor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain: \nThe bars are broken, and the guards are slain. \nIn rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill; \nThose few defendants whom they find, they kill. \nNot with so fierce a rage the foaming flood \nRoars, when he finds his rapid course withstood; \nBears down the dams with unresisted sway, \nAnd sweeps the cattle and the cots away. \nThese eyes beheld him when he march'd between \nThe brother kings: I saw th' unhappy queen, \nThe hundred wives, and where old Priam stood, \nTo stain his hallow'd altar with his brood. \nThe fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he, \nSo large a promise, of a progeny), \nThe posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils, \nFell the reward of the proud victor's toils. \nWhere'er the raging fire had left a space, \nThe Grecians enter and possess the place. \n\"Perhaps you may of Priam's fate enquire. \nHe, when he saw his regal town on fire, \nHis ruin'd palace, and his ent'ring foes, \nOn ev'ry side inevitable woes, \nIn arms, disus'd, invests his limbs, decay'd, \nLike them, with age; a late and useless aid. \nHis feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain; \nLoaded, not arm'd, he creeps along with pain, \nDespairing of success, ambitious to be slain! \nUncover'd but by heav'n, there stood in view \nAn altar; near the hearth a laurel grew, \nDodder'd with age, whose boughs encompass round \nThe household gods, and shade the holy ground. \nHere Hecuba, with all her helpless train \nOf dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain. \nDriv'n like a flock of doves along the sky, \nTheir images they hug, and to their altars fly. \nThe Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord, \nAnd hanging by his side a heavy sword, \n'What rage,' she cried, 'has seiz'd my husband's mind? \nWhat arms are these, and to what use design'd? \nThese times want other aids! Were Hector here, \nEv'n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear. \nWith us, one common shelter thou shalt find, \nOr in one common fate with us be join'd.' \nShe said, and with a last salute embrac'd \nThe poor old man, and by the laurel plac'd. \nBehold! Polites, one of Priam's sons, \nPursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs. \nThro' swords and foes, amaz'd and hurt, he flies \nThro' empty courts and open galleries. \nHim Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues, \nAnd often reaches, and his thrusts renews. \nThe youth, transfix'd, with lamentable cries, \nExpires before his wretched parent's eyes: \nWhom gasping at his feet when Priam saw, \nThe fear of death gave place to nature's law; \nAnd, shaking more with anger than with age, \n'The gods,' said he, 'requite thy brutal rage! \nAs sure they will, barbarian, sure they must, \nIf there be gods in heav'n, and gods be just- \nWho tak'st in wrongs an insolent delight; \nWith a son's death t' infect a father's sight. \nNot he, whom thou and lying fame conspire \nTo call thee his- not he, thy vaunted sire, \nThus us'd my wretched age: the gods he fear'd, \nThe laws of nature and of nations heard. \nHe cheer'd my sorrows, and, for sums of gold, \nThe bloodless carcass of my Hector sold; \nPitied the woes a parent underwent, \nAnd sent me back in safety from his tent.' \n\"This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw, \nWhich, flutt'ring, seem'd to loiter as it flew: \nJust, and but barely, to the mark it held, \nAnd faintly tinkled on the brazen shield. \n\"Then Pyrrhus thus: 'Go thou from me to fate, \nAnd to my father my foul deeds relate. \nNow die!' With that he dragg'd the trembling sire, \nSlidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire, \n(The mingled paste his murder'd son had made,) \nHaul'd from beneath the violated shade, \nAnd on the sacred pile the royal victim laid. \nHis right hand held his bloody falchion bare, \nHis left he twisted in his hoary hair; \nThen, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found: \nThe lukewarm blood came rushing thro' the wound, \nAnd sanguine streams distain'd the sacred ground. \nThus Priam fell, and shar'd one common fate \nWith Troy in ashes, and his ruin'd state: \nHe, who the scepter of all Asia sway'd, \nWhom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd. \nOn the bleak shore now lies th' abandon'd king, \nA headless carcass, and a nameless thing. \n\"Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood \nCongeal with fear, my hair with horror stood: \nMy father's image fill'd my pious mind, \nLest equal years might equal fortune find. \nAgain I thought on my forsaken wife, \nAnd trembled for my son's abandon'd life. \nI look'd about, but found myself alone, \nDeserted at my need! My friends were gone. \nSome spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd, \nLeap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the rest.\n\nThus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide, \nThe graceless Helen in the porch I spied \nOf Vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone; \nMuffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown: \nBut, by the flames that cast their blaze around, \nThat common bane of Greece and Troy I found. \nFor Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword; \nMore dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord; \nEv'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd. \nTrembling with rage, the strumpet I regard, \nResolv'd to give her guilt the due reward: \n'Shall she triumphant sail before the wind, \nAnd leave in flames unhappy Troy behind? \nShall she her kingdom and her friends review, \nIn state attended with a captive crew, \nWhile unreveng'd the good old Priam falls, \nAnd Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls? \nFor this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood \nWere swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood? \n'T is true, a soldier can small honor gain, \nAnd boast no conquest, from a woman slain: \nYet shall the fact not pass without applause, \nOf vengeance taken in so just a cause; \nThe punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease, \nAnd murm'ring manes of my friends appease.' \nThus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light \nSpread o'er the place; and, shining heav'nly bright, \nMy mother stood reveal'd before my sight \nNever so radiant did her eyes appear; \nNot her own star confess'd a light so clear: \nGreat in her charms, as when on gods above \nShe looks, and breathes herself into their love. \nShe held my hand, the destin'd blow to break; \nThen from her rosy lips began to speak: \n'My son, from whence this madness, this neglect \nOf my commands, and those whom I protect? \nWhy this unmanly rage? Recall to mind \nWhom you forsake, what pledges leave behind. \nLook if your helpless father yet survive, \nOr if Ascanius or Creusa live. \nAround your house the greedy Grecians err; \nAnd these had perish'd in the nightly war, \nBut for my presence and protecting care. \nNot Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault; \nBut by the gods was this destruction brought. \nNow cast your eyes around, while I dissolve \nThe mists and films that mortal eyes involve, \nPurge from your sight the dross, and make you see \nThe shape of each avenging deity. \nEnlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil, \nNor fear obedience to your mother's will. \nWhere yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies, \nStones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise- \nAmid that smother Neptune holds his place, \nBelow the wall's foundation drives his mace, \nAnd heaves the building from the solid base. \nLook where, in arms, imperial Juno stands \nFull in the Scaean gate, with loud commands, \nUrging on shore the tardy Grecian bands. \nSee! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud, \nBestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud: \nSee! Jove new courage to the foe supplies, \nAnd arms against the town the partial deities. \nHaste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end: \nHaste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend: \nHaste; and a mother's care your passage shall befriend.'\n\nShe said, and swiftly vanish'd from my sight, \nObscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night. \nI look'd, I listen'd; dreadful sounds I hear; \nAnd the dire forms of hostile gods appear. \nTroy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent), \nAnd Ilium from its old foundations rent; \nRent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds, \nAnd stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds. \nAbout the roots the cruel ax resounds; \nThe stumps are pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds: \nThe war is felt on high; the nodding crown \nNow threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down. \nTo their united force it yields, tho' late, \nAnd mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate: \nThe roots no more their upper load sustain; \nBut down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain. \n\"Descending thence, I scape thro' foes and fire: \nBefore the goddess, foes and flames retire. \nArriv'd at home, he, for whose only sake, \nOr most for his, such toils I undertake, \nThe good Anchises, whom, by timely flight, \nI purpos'd to secure on Ida's height, \nRefus'd the journey, resolute to die \nAnd add his fun'rals to the fate of Troy, \nRather than exile and old age sustain. \n'Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev'ry vein. \nHad Heav'n decreed that I should life enjoy, \nHeav'n had decreed to save unhappy Troy. \n'T is, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, \nTwice to have seen our Ilium overthrown. \nMake haste to save the poor remaining crew, \nAnd give this useless corpse a long adieu. \nThese weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; \nAt least the pitying foes will aid my death, \nTo take my spoils, and leave my body bare: \nAs for my sepulcher, let Heav'n take care. \n'T is long since I, for my celestial wife \nLoath'd by the gods, have dragg'd a ling'ring life; \nSince ev'ry hour and moment I expire, \nBlasted from heav'n by Jove's avenging fire.' \nThis oft repeated, he stood fix'd to die: \nMyself, my wife, my son, my family, \nIntreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry- \n'What, will he still persist, on death resolve, \nAnd in his ruin all his house involve!' \nHe still persists his reasons to maintain; \nOur pray'rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. \n\"Urg'd by despair, again I go to try \nThe fate of arms, resolv'd in fight to die: \n'What hope remains, but what my death must give? \nCan I, without so dear a father, live? \nYou term it prudence, what I baseness call: \nCould such a word from such a parent fall? \nIf Fortune please, and so the gods ordain, \nThat nothing should of ruin'd Troy remain, \nAnd you conspire with Fortune to be slain, \nThe way to death is wide, th' approaches near: \nFor soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear, \nReeking with Priam's blood- the wretch who slew \nThe son (inhuman) in the father's view, \nAnd then the sire himself to the dire altar drew. \nO goddess mother, give me back to Fate; \nYour gift was undesir'd, and came too late! \nDid you, for this, unhappy me convey \nThro' foes and fires, to see my house a prey? \nShall I my father, wife, and son behold, \nWelt'ring in blood, each other's arms infold? \nHaste! gird my sword, tho' spent and overcome: \n'T is the last summons to receive our doom. \nI hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call! \nNot unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall. \nRestore me to the yet unfinish'd fight: \nMy death is wanting to conclude the night.' \nArm'd once again, my glitt'ring sword I wield, \nWhile th' other hand sustains my weighty shield, \nAnd forth I rush to seek th' abandon'd field. \nI went; but sad Creusa stopp'd my way, \nAnd cross the threshold in my passage lay, \nEmbrac'd my knees, and, when I would have gone, \nShew'd me my feeble sire and tender son: \n'If death be your design, at least,' said she, \n'Take us along to share your destiny. \nIf any farther hopes in arms remain, \nThis place, these pledges of your love, maintain. \nTo whom do you expose your father's life, \nYour son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife!' \nWhile thus she fills the house with clam'rous cries, \nOur hearing is diverted by our eyes: \nFor, while I held my son, in the short space \nBetwixt our kisses and our last embrace; \nStrange to relate, from young Iulus' head \nA lambent flame arose, which gently spread \nAround his brows, and on his temples fed. \nAmaz'd, with running water we prepare \nTo quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair; \nBut old Anchises, vers'd in omens, rear'd \nHis hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd: \n'If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend \nThy will; if piety can pray'rs commend, \nConfirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send.'\n\nScarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear \nA peal of rattling thunder roll in air: \nThere shot a streaming lamp along the sky, \nWhich on the winged lightning seem'd to fly; \nFrom o'er the roof the blaze began to move, \nAnd, trailing, vanish'd in th' Idaean grove. \nIt swept a path in heav'n, and shone a guide, \nThen in a steaming stench of sulphur died. \n\"The good old man with suppliant hands implor'd \nThe gods' protection, and their star ador'd. \n'Now, now,' said he, 'my son, no more delay! \nI yield, I follow where Heav'n shews the way. \nKeep, O my country gods, our dwelling place, \nAnd guard this relic of the Trojan race, \nThis tender child! These omens are your own, \nAnd you can yet restore the ruin'd town. \nAt least accomplish what your signs foreshow: \nI stand resign'd, and am prepar'd to go.' \n\"He said. The crackling flames appear on high. \nAnd driving sparkles dance along the sky. \nWith Vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire, \nAnd near our palace roll the flood of fire. \n'Haste, my dear father, ('t is no time to wait,) \nAnd load my shoulders with a willing freight. \nWhate'er befalls, your life shall be my care; \nOne death, or one deliv'rance, we will share. \nMy hand shall lead our little son; and you, \nMy faithful consort, shall our steps pursue. \nNext, you, my servants, heed my strict commands: \nWithout the walls a ruin'd temple stands, \nTo Ceres hallow'd once; a cypress nigh \nShoots up her venerable head on high, \nBy long religion kept; there bend your feet, \nAnd in divided parties let us meet. \nOur country gods, the relics, and the bands, \nHold you, my father, in your guiltless hands: \nIn me 't is impious holy things to bear, \nRed as I am with slaughter, new from war, \nTill in some living stream I cleanse the guilt \nOf dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.' \nThus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide, \nI clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide \nAnd yellow spoils; then, on my bending back, \nThe welcome load of my dear father take; \nWhile on my better hand Ascanius hung, \nAnd with unequal paces tripp'd along. \nCreusa kept behind; by choice we stray \nThro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way. \nI, who so bold and dauntless, just before, \nThe Grecian darts and shock of lances bore, \nAt ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with fear, \nNot for myself, but for the charge I bear; \nTill, near the ruin'd gate arriv'd at last, \nSecure, and deeming all the danger past, \nA frightful noise of trampling feet we hear. \nMy father, looking thro' the shades, with fear, \nCried out: 'Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh; \nTheir swords and shining armor I descry.' \nSome hostile god, for some unknown offense, \nHad sure bereft my mind of better sense; \nFor, while thro' winding ways I took my flight, \nAnd sought the shelter of the gloomy night, \nAlas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell \nIf by her fatal destiny she fell, \nOr weary sate, or wander'd with affright; \nBut she was lost for ever to my sight. \nI knew not, or reflected, till I meet \nMy friends, at Ceres' now deserted seat. \nWe met: not one was wanting; only she \nDeceiv'd her friends, her son, and wretched me. \n\"What mad expressions did my tongue refuse! \nWhom did I not, of gods or men, accuse! \nThis was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more \nThan all I felt from ruin'd Troy before. \nStung with my loss, and raving with despair, \nAbandoning my now forgotten care, \nOf counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft, \nMy sire, my son, my country gods I left. \nIn shining armor once again I sheathe \nMy limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death. \nThen headlong to the burning walls I run, \nAnd seek the danger I was forc'd to shun. \nI tread my former tracks; thro' night explore \nEach passage, ev'ry street I cross'd before. \nAll things were full of horror and affright, \nAnd dreadful ev'n the silence of the night. \nThen to my father's house I make repair, \nWith some small glimpse of hope to find her there. \nInstead of her, the cruel Greeks I met; \nThe house was fill'd with foes, with flames beset. \nDriv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire, \nThro' air transported, to the roofs aspire. \nFrom thence to Priam's palace I resort, \nAnd search the citadel and desart court. \nThen, unobserv'd, I pass by Juno's church: \nA guard of Grecians had possess'd the porch; \nThere Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey, \nAnd thither all the wealth of Troy convey: \nThe spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought, \nAnd golden bowls from burning altars caught, \nThe tables of the gods, the purple vests, \nThe people's treasure, and the pomp of priests. \nA rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands, \nAnd captive matrons, in long order stands. \nThen, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim, \nThro' all the silent street, Creusa's name: \nCreusa still I call; at length she hears, \nAnd sudden thro' the shades of night appears- \nAppears, no more Creusa, nor my wife, \nBut a pale specter, larger than the life. \nAghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear, \nI stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair. \nThen thus the ghost began to soothe my grief \n'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief. \nDesist, my much-lov'd lord,'t indulge your pain; \nYou bear no more than what the gods ordain. \nMy fates permit me not from hence to fly; \nNor he, the great controller of the sky. \nLong wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree; \nOn land hard labors, and a length of sea. \nThen, after many painful years are past, \nOn Latium's happy shore you shall be cast, \nWhere gentle Tiber from his bed beholds \nThe flow'ry meadows, and the feeding folds. \nThere end your toils; and there your fates provide \nA quiet kingdom, and a royal bride: \nThere fortune shall the Trojan line restore, \nAnd you for lost Creusa weep no more. \nFear not that I shall watch, with servile shame, \nTh' imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame; \nOr, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace \nMy goddess mother, or my royal race. \nAnd now, farewell! The parent of the gods \nRestrains my fleeting soul in her abodes: \nI trust our common issue to your care.' \nShe said, and gliding pass'd unseen in air. \nI strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue; \nAnd thrice about her neck my arms I flung, \nAnd, thrice deceiv'd, on vain embraces hung. \nLight as an empty dream at break of day, \nOr as a blast of wind, she rush'd away. \n\"Thus having pass'd the night in fruitless pain, \nI to my longing friends return again, \nAmaz'd th' augmented number to behold, \nOf men and matrons mix'd, of young and old; \nA wretched exil'd crew together brought, \nWith arms appointed, and with treasure fraught, \nResolv'd, and willing, under my command, \nTo run all hazards both of sea and land. \nThe Morn began, from Ida, to display \nHer rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day: \nBefore the gates the Grecians took their post, \nAnd all pretense of late relief was lost. \nI yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, \nAnd, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.\" \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK III\n\n\"When Heav'n had overturn'd the Trojan state \nAnd Priam's throne, by too severe a fate; \nWhen ruin'd Troy became the Grecians' prey, \nAnd Ilium's lofty tow'rs in ashes lay; \nWarn'd by celestial omens, we retreat, \nTo seek in foreign lands a happier seat. \nNear old Antandros, and at Ida's foot, \nThe timber of the sacred groves we cut, \nAnd build our fleet; uncertain yet to find \nWhat place the gods for our repose assign'd. \nFriends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring \nBegan to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, \nWhen old Anchises summon'd all to sea: \nThe crew my father and the Fates obey. \nWith sighs and tears I leave my native shore, \nAnd empty fields, where Ilium stood before. \nMy sire, my son, our less and greater gods, \nAll sail at once, and cleave the briny floods. \n\"Against our coast appears a spacious land, \nWhich once the fierce Lycurgus did command, \n(Thracia the name- the people bold in war; \nVast are their fields, and tillage is their care,) \nA hospitable realm while Fate was kind, \nWith Troy in friendship and religion join'd. \nI land; with luckless omens then adore \nTheir gods, and draw a line along the shore; \nI lay the deep foundations of a wall, \nAnd Aenos, nam'd from me, the city call. \nTo Dionaean Venus vows are paid, \nAnd all the pow'rs that rising labors aid; \nA bull on Jove's imperial altar laid. \nNot far, a rising hillock stood in view; \nSharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew. \nThere, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes, \nAnd shade our altar with their leafy greens, \nI pull'd a plant- with horror I relate \nA prodigy so strange and full of fate. \nThe rooted fibers rose, and from the wound \nBlack bloody drops distill'd upon the ground. \nMute and amaz'd, my hair with terror stood; \nFear shrunk my sinews, and congeal'd my blood. \nMann'd once again, another plant I try: \nThat other gush'd with the same sanguine dye. \nThen, fearing guilt for some offense unknown, \nWith pray'rs and vows the Dryads I atone, \nWith all the sisters of the woods, and most \nThe God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast, \nThat they, or he, these omens would avert, \nRelease our fears, and better signs impart. \nClear'd, as I thought, and fully fix'd at length \nTo learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength: \nI bent my knees against the ground; once more \nThe violated myrtle ran with gore. \nScarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb \nOf wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb, \nA groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd \nMy fright, and then these dreadful words ensued: \n'Why dost thou thus my buried body rend? \nO spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend! \nSpare to pollute thy pious hands with blood: \nThe tears distil not from the wounded wood; \nBut ev'ry drop this living tree contains \nIs kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins. \nO fly from this unhospitable shore, \nWarn'd by my fate; for I am Polydore! \nHere loads of lances, in my blood embrued, \nAgain shoot upward, by my blood renew'd.' \n\"My falt'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare \nMy horror, and in bristles rose my hair. \nWhen Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent, \nOld Priam, fearful of the war's event, \nThis hapless Polydore to Thracia sent: \nLoaded with gold, he sent his darling, far \nFrom noise and tumults, and destructive war, \nCommitted to the faithless tyrant's care; \nWho, when he saw the pow'r of Troy decline, \nForsook the weaker, with the strong to join; \nBroke ev'ry bond of nature and of truth, \nAnd murder'd, for his wealth, the royal youth. \nO sacred hunger of pernicious gold! \nWhat bands of faith can impious lucre hold? \nNow, when my soul had shaken off her fears, \nI call my father and the Trojan peers; \nRelate the prodigies of Heav'n, require \nWhat he commands, and their advice desire. \nAll vote to leave that execrable shore, \nPolluted with the blood of Polydore; \nBut, ere we sail, his fun'ral rites prepare, \nThen, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear. \nIn mournful pomp the matrons walk the round, \nWith baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd, \nWith eyes dejected, and with hair unbound. \nThen bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour, \nAnd thrice invoke the soul of Polydore. \n\"Now, when the raging storms no longer reign, \nBut southern gales invite us to the main, \nWe launch our vessels, with a prosp'rous wind, \nAnd leave the cities and the shores behind. \n\"An island in th' Aegaean main appears; \nNeptune and wat'ry Doris claim it theirs. \nIt floated once, till Phoebus fix'd the sides \nTo rooted earth, and now it braves the tides. \nHere, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore, \nWith needful ease our weary limbs restore, \nAnd the Sun's temple and his town adore. \n\"Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crown'd, \nHis hoary locks with purple fillets bound, \nWho saw my sire the Delian shore ascend, \nCame forth with eager haste to meet his friend; \nInvites him to his palace; and, in sign \nOf ancient love, their plighted hands they join. \nThen to the temple of the god I went, \nAnd thus, before the shrine, my vows present: \n'Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place \nTo the sad relics of the Trojan race; \nA seat secure, a region of their own, \nA lasting empire, and a happier town. \nWhere shall we fix? where shall our labors end? \nWhom shall we follow, and what fate attend? \nLet not my pray'rs a doubtful answer find; \nBut in clear auguries unveil thy mind.' \nScarce had I said: he shook the holy ground, \nThe laurels, and the lofty hills around; \nAnd from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound. \nProstrate we fell; confess'd the present god, \nWho gave this answer from his dark abode: \n'Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth \nFrom which your ancestors derive their birth. \nThe soil that sent you forth, her ancient race \nIn her old bosom shall again embrace. \nThro' the wide world th' Aeneian house shall reign, \nAnd children's children shall the crown sustain.' \nThus Phoebus did our future fates disclose: \nA mighty tumult, mix'd with joy, arose. \n\"All are concern'd to know what place the god \nAssign'd, and where determin'd our abode. \nMy father, long revolving in his mind \nThe race and lineage of the Trojan kind, \nThus answer'd their demands: 'Ye princes, hear \nYour pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear. \nThe fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame, \nSacred of old to Jove's imperial name, \nIn the mid ocean lies, with large command, \nAnd on its plains a hundred cities stand. \nAnother Ida rises there, and we \nFrom thence derive our Trojan ancestry. \nFrom thence, as 't is divulg'd by certain fame, \nTo the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came; \nThere fix'd, and there the seat of empire chose, \nEre Ilium and the Trojan tow'rs arose. \nIn humble vales they built their soft abodes, \nTill Cybele, the mother of the gods, \nWith tinkling cymbals charm'd th' Idaean woods, \nShe secret rites and ceremonies taught, \nAnd to the yoke the savage lions brought. \nLet us the land which Heav'n appoints, explore; \nAppease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore. \nIf Jove assists the passage of our fleet, \nThe third propitious dawn discovers Crete.' \nThus having said, the sacrifices, laid \nOn smoking altars, to the gods he paid: \nA bull, to Neptune an oblation due, \nAnother bull to bright Apollo slew; \nA milk-white ewe, the western winds to please, \nAnd one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas. \nEre this, a flying rumor had been spread \nThat fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled, \nExpell'd and exil'd; that the coast was free \nFrom foreign or domestic enemy. \n\"We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea; \nBy Naxos, fam'd for vintage, make our way; \nThen green Donysa pass; and sail in sight \nOf Paros' isle, with marble quarries white. \nWe pass the scatter'd isles of Cyclades, \nThat, scarce distinguish'd, seem to stud the seas. \nThe shouts of sailors double near the shores; \nThey stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars. \n'All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!' they cry, \nAnd swiftly thro' the foamy billows fly. \nFull on the promis'd land at length we bore, \nWith joy descending on the Cretan shore. \nWith eager haste a rising town I frame, \nWhich from the Trojan Pergamus I name: \nThe name itself was grateful; I exhort \nTo found their houses, and erect a fort. \nOur ships are haul'd upon the yellow strand; \nThe youth begin to till the labor'd land; \nAnd I myself new marriages promote, \nGive laws, and dwellings I divide by lot; \nWhen rising vapors choke the wholesome air, \nAnd blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year; \nThe trees devouring caterpillars burn; \nParch'd was the grass, and blighted was the corn: \nNor 'scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high, \nWith pestilential heat infects the sky: \nMy men- some fall, the rest in fevers fry. \nAgain my father bids me seek the shore \nOf sacred Delos, and the god implore, \nTo learn what end of woes we might expect, \nAnd to what clime our weary course direct. \n\"'T was night, when ev'ry creature, void of cares, \nThe common gift of balmy slumber shares: \nThe statues of my gods (for such they seem'd), \nThose gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem'd, \nBefore me stood, majestically bright, \nFull in the beams of Phoebe's ent'ring light. \nThen thus they spoke, and eas'd my troubled mind: \n'What from the Delian god thou go'st to find, \nHe tells thee here, and sends us to relate. \nThose pow'rs are we, companions of thy fate, \nWho from the burning town by thee were brought, \nThy fortune follow'd, and thy safety wrought. \nThro' seas and lands as we thy steps attend, \nSo shall our care thy glorious race befriend. \nAn ample realm for thee thy fates ordain, \nA town that o'er the conquer'd world shall reign. \nThou, mighty walls for mighty nations build; \nNor let thy weary mind to labors yield: \nBut change thy seat; for not the Delian god, \nNor we, have giv'n thee Crete for our abode. \nA land there is, Hesperia call'd of old, \n(The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold- \nTh' Oenotrians held it once,) by later fame \nNow call'd Italia, from the leader's name. \nlasius there and Dardanus were born; \nFrom thence we came, and thither must return. \nRise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet. \nSearch Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.' \n\"Astonish'd at their voices and their sight, \n(Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night; \nI saw, I knew their faces, and descried, \nIn perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;) \nI started from my couch; a clammy sweat \nOn all my limbs and shiv'ring body sate. \nTo heav'n I lift my hands with pious haste, \nAnd sacred incense in the flames I cast. \nThus to the gods their perfect honors done, \nMore cheerful, to my good old sire I run, \nAnd tell the pleasing news. In little space \nHe found his error of the double race; \nNot, as before he deem'd, deriv'd from Crete; \nNo more deluded by the doubtful seat: \nThen said: 'O son, turmoil'd in Trojan fate! \nSuch things as these Cassandra did relate. \nThis day revives within my mind what she \nForetold of Troy renew'd in Italy, \nAnd Latian lands; but who could then have thought \nThat Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought, \nOr who believ'd what mad Cassandra taught? \nNow let us go where Phoebus leads the way.' \n\"He said; and we with glad consent obey, \nForsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, \nWe spread our sails before the willing wind. \nNow from the sight of land our galleys move, \nWith only seas around and skies above; \nWhen o'er our heads descends a burst of rain, \nAnd night with sable clouds involves the main; \nThe ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; \nThe scatter'd fleet is forc'd to sev'ral ways; \nThe face of heav'n is ravish'd from our eyes, \nAnd in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. \nCast from our course, we wander in the dark. \nNo stars to guide, no point of land to mark. \nEv'n Palinurus no distinction found \nBetwixt the night and day; such darkness reign'd around.\n\nThree starless nights the doubtful navy strays, \nWithout distinction, and three sunless days; \nThe fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds, \nWe view a rising land, like distant clouds; \nThe mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight, \nAnd curling smoke ascending from their height. \nThe canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply; \nFrom the rude strokes the whirling waters fly. \nAt length I land upon the Strophades, \nSafe from the danger of the stormy seas. \nThose isles are compass'd by th' Ionian main, \nThe dire abode where the foul Harpies reign, \nForc'd by the winged warriors to repair \nTo their old homes, and leave their costly fare. \nMonsters more fierce offended Heav'n ne'er sent \nFrom hell's abyss, for human punishment: \nWith virgin faces, but with wombs obscene, \nFoul paunches, and with ordure still unclean; \nWith claws for hands, and looks for ever lean. \n\"We landed at the port, and soon beheld \nFat herds of oxen graze the flow'ry field, \nAnd wanton goats without a keeper stray'd. \nWith weapons we the welcome prey invade, \nThen call the gods for partners of our feast, \nAnd Jove himself, the chief invited guest. \nWe spread the tables on the greensward ground; \nWe feed with hunger, and the bowls go round; \nWhen from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry, \nAnd clatt'ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly; \nThey snatch the meat, defiling all they find, \nAnd, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind. \nClose by a hollow rock, again we sit, \nNew dress the dinner, and the beds refit, \nSecure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade, \nWhere tufted trees a native arbor made. \nAgain the holy fires on altars burn; \nAnd once again the rav'nous birds return, \nOr from the dark recesses where they lie, \nOr from another quarter of the sky; \nWith filthy claws their odious meal repeat, \nAnd mix their loathsome ordures with their meat. \nI bid my friends for vengeance then prepare, \nAnd with the hellish nation wage the war. \nThey, as commanded, for the fight provide, \nAnd in the grass their glitt'ring weapons hide; \nThen, when along the crooked shore we hear \nTheir clatt'ring wings, and saw the foes appear, \nMisenus sounds a charge: we take th' alarm, \nAnd our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm. \nIn this new kind of combat all employ \nTheir utmost force, the monsters to destroy. \nIn vain- the fated skin is proof to wounds; \nAnd from their plumes the shining sword rebounds. \nAt length rebuff'd, they leave their mangled prey, \nAnd their stretch'd pinions to the skies display. \nYet one remain'd- the messenger of Fate: \nHigh on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate, \nAnd thus her dismal errand did relate: \n'What! not contented with our oxen slain, \nDare you with Heav'n an impious war maintain, \nAnd drive the Harpies from their native reign? \nHeed therefore what I say; and keep in mind \nWhat Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design'd, \nAnd I, the Furies' queen, from both relate- \nYou seek th' Italian shores, foredoom'd by fate: \nTh' Italian shores are granted you to find, \nAnd a safe passage to the port assign'd. \nBut know, that ere your promis'd walls you build, \nMy curses shall severely be fulfill'd. \nFierce famine is your lot for this misdeed, \nReduc'd to grind the plates on which you feed.' \nShe said, and to the neighb'ring forest flew. \nOur courage fails us, and our fears renew. \nHopeless to win by war, to pray'rs we fall, \nAnd on th' offended Harpies humbly call, \nAnd whether gods or birds obscene they were, \nOur vows for pardon and for peace prefer. \nBut old Anchises, off'ring sacrifice, \nAnd lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes, \nAdor'd the greater gods: 'Avert,' said he, \n'These omens; render vain this prophecy, \nAnd from th' impending curse a pious people free!' \n\"Thus having said, he bids us put to sea; \nWe loose from shore our haulsers, and obey, \nAnd soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way. \nAmidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear; \nAnd next by rocky Neritos we steer: \nWe fly from Ithaca's detested shore, \nAnd curse the land which dire Ulysses bore. \nAt length Leucate's cloudy top appears, \nAnd the Sun's temple, which the sailor fears. \nResolv'd to breathe a while from labor past, \nOur crooked anchors from the prow we cast, \nAnd joyful to the little city haste. \nHere, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay \nTo Jove, the guide and patron of our way. \nThe customs of our country we pursue, \nAnd Trojan games on Actian shores renew. \nOur youth their naked limbs besmear with oil, \nAnd exercise the wrastlers' noble toil; \nPleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind, \nAnd left so many Grecian towns behind. \nThe sun had now fulfill'd his annual course, \nAnd Boreas on the seas display'd his force: \nI fix'd upon the temple's lofty door \nThe brazen shield which vanquish'd Abas bore; \nThe verse beneath my name and action speaks: \n'These arms Aeneas took from conqu'ring Greeks.' \nThen I command to weigh; the seamen ply \nTheir sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly. \nThe sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost, \nAnd skimm'd along Epirus' rocky coast. \n\"Then to Chaonia's port our course we bend, \nAnd, landed, to Buthrotus' heights ascend. \nHere wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame: \nHow Helenus reviv'd the Trojan name, \nAnd reign'd in Greece; that Priam's captive son \nSucceeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne; \nAnd fair Andromache, restor'd by fate, \nOnce more was happy in a Trojan mate. \nI leave my galleys riding in the port, \nAnd long to see the new Dardanian court. \nBy chance, the mournful queen, before the gate, \nThen solemniz'd her former husband's fate. \nGreen altars, rais'd of turf, with gifts she crown'd, \nAnd sacred priests in order stand around, \nAnd thrice the name of hapless Hector sound. \nThe grove itself resembles Ida's wood; \nAnd Simois seem'd the well-dissembled flood. \nBut when at nearer distance she beheld \nMy shining armor and my Trojan shield, \nAstonish'd at the sight, the vital heat \nForsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat: \nShe faints, she falls, and scarce recov'ring strength, \nThus, with a falt'ring tongue, she speaks at length: \n\"'Are you alive, O goddess-born ?' she said, \n'Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?' \nAt this, she cast a loud and frightful cry. \nWith broken words I made this brief reply: \n'All of me that remains appears in sight; \nI live, if living be to loathe the light. \nNo phantom; but I drag a wretched life, \nMy fate resembling that of Hector's wife. \nWhat have you suffer'd since you lost your lord? \nBy what strange blessing are you now restor'd? \nStill are you Hector's? or is Hector fled, \nAnd his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus' bed?' \nWith eyes dejected, in a lowly tone, \nAfter a modest pause she thus begun: \n\"'O only happy maid of Priam's race, \nWhom death deliver'd from the foes' embrace! \nCommanded on Achilles' tomb to die, \nNot forc'd, like us, to hard captivity, \nOr in a haughty master's arms to lie. \nIn Grecian ships unhappy we were borne, \nEndur'd the victor's lust, sustain'd the scorn: \nThus I submitted to the lawless pride \nOf Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride. \nCloy'd with possession, he forsook my bed, \nAnd Helen's lovely daughter sought to wed; \nThen me to Trojan Helenus resign'd, \nAnd his two slaves in equal marriage join'd; \nTill young Orestes, pierc'd with deep despair, \nAnd longing to redeem the promis'd fair, \nBefore Apollo's altar slew the ravisher. \nBy Pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regain'd: \nAt least one half with Helenus remain'd. \nOur part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls, \nAnd names from Pergamus his rising walls. \nBut you, what fates have landed on our coast? \nWhat gods have sent you, or what storms have toss'd? \nDoes young Ascanius life and health enjoy, \nSav'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy? \nO tell me how his mother's loss he bears, \nWhat hopes are promis'd from his blooming years, \nHow much of Hector in his face appears?' \nShe spoke; and mix'd her speech with mournful cries, \nAnd fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes. \n\"At length her lord descends upon the plain, \nIn pomp, attended with a num'rous train; \nReceives his friends, and to the city leads, \nAnd tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds. \nProceeding on, another Troy I see, \nOr, in less compass, Troy's epitome. \nA riv'let by the name of Xanthus ran, \nAnd I embrace the Scaean gate again. \nMy friends in porticoes were entertain'd, \nAnd feasts and pleasures thro' the city reign'd. \nThe tables fill'd the spacious hall around, \nAnd golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd. \nTwo days we pass'd in mirth, till friendly gales, \nBlown from the supplied our swelling sails. \nThen to the royal seer I thus began: \n'O thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of man, \nThe laws of heav'n, and what the stars decree; \nWhom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy, \nFrom his own tripod, and his holy tree; \nSkill'd in the wing'd inhabitants of air, \nWhat auspices their notes and flights declare: \nO say- for all religious rites portend \nA happy voyage, and a prosp'rous end; \nAnd ev'ry power and omen of the sky \nDirect my course for destin'd Italy; \nBut only dire Celaeno, from the gods, \nA dismal famine fatally forebodes- \nO say what dangers I am first to shun, \nWhat toils vanquish, and what course to run.' \n\"The prophet first with sacrifice adores \nThe greater gods; their pardon then implores; \nUnbinds the fillet from his holy head; \nTo Phoebus, next, my trembling steps he led, \nFull of religious doubts and awful dread. \nThen, with his god possess'd, before the shrine, \nThese words proceeded from his mouth divine: \n'O goddess-born, (for Heav'n's appointed will, \nWith greater auspices of good than ill, \nForeshows thy voyage, and thy course directs; \nThy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,) \nOf many things some few I shall explain, \nTeach thee to shun the dangers of the main, \nAnd how at length the promis'd shore to gain. \nThe rest the fates from Helenus conceal, \nAnd Juno's angry pow'r forbids to tell. \nFirst, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh, \nWill far from your deluded wishes fly; \nLong tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy: \nFor you must cruise along Sicilian shores, \nAnd stem the currents with your struggling oars; \nThen round th' Italian coast your navy steer; \nAnd, after this, to Circe's island veer; \nAnd, last, before your new foundations rise, \nMust pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies. \nNow mark the signs of future ease and rest, \nAnd bear them safely treasur'd in thy breast. \nWhen, in the shady shelter of a wood, \nAnd near the margin of a gentle flood, \nThou shalt behold a sow upon the ground, \nWith thirty sucking young encompass'd round; \nThe dam and offspring white as falling snow- \nThese on thy city shall their name bestow, \nAnd there shall end thy labors and thy woe. \nNor let the threaten'd famine fright thy mind, \nFor Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find. \nLet not thy course to that ill coast be bent, \nWhich fronts from far th' Epirian continent: \nThose parts are all by Grecian foes possess'd; \nThe salvage Locrians here the shores infest; \nThere fierce Idomeneus his city builds, \nAnd guards with arms the Salentinian fields; \nAnd on the mountain's brow Petilia stands, \nWhich Philoctetes with his troops commands. \nEv'n when thy fleet is landed on the shore, \nAnd priests with holy vows the gods adore, \nThen with a purple veil involve your eyes, \nLest hostile faces blast the sacrifice. \nThese rites and customs to the rest commend, \nThat to your pious race they may descend. \n\n\"'When, parted hence, the wind, that ready waits \nFor Sicily, shall bear you to the straits \nWhere proud Pelorus opes a wider way, \nTack to the larboard, and stand off to sea: \nVeer starboard sea and land. Th' Italian shore \nAnd fair Sicilia's coast were one, before \nAn earthquake caus'd the flaw: the roaring tides \nThe passage broke that land from land divides; \nAnd where the lands retir'd, the rushing ocean rides. \nDistinguish'd by the straits, on either hand, \nNow rising cities in long order stand, \nAnd fruitful fields: so much can time invade \nThe mold'ring work that beauteous Nature made. \nFar on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides: \nCharybdis roaring on the left presides, \nAnd in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides; \nThen spouts them from below: with fury driv'n, \nThe waves mount up and wash the face of heav'n. \nBut Scylla from her den, with open jaws, \nThe sinking vessel in her eddy draws, \nThen dashes on the rocks. A human face, \nAnd virgin bosom, hides her tail's disgrace: \nHer parts obscene below the waves descend, \nWith dogs inclos'd, and in a dolphin end. \n'T is safer, then, to bear aloof to sea, \nAnd coast Pachynus, tho' with more delay, \nThan once to view misshapen Scylla near, \nAnd the loud yell of wat'ry wolves to hear. \n\"'Besides, if faith to Helenus be due, \nAnd if prophetic Phoebus tell me true, \nDo not this precept of your friend forget, \nWhich therefore more than once I must repeat: \nAbove the rest, great Juno's name adore; \nPay vows to Juno; Juno's aid implore. \nLet gifts be to the mighty queen design'd, \nAnd mollify with pray'rs her haughty mind. \nThus, at the length, your passage shall be free, \nAnd you shall safe descend on Italy. \nArriv'd at Cumae, when you view the flood \nOf black Avernus, and the sounding wood, \nThe mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find, \nDark in a cave, and on a rock reclin'd. \nShe sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits, \nThe notes and names, inscrib'd, to leafs commits. \nWhat she commits to leafs, in order laid, \nBefore the cavern's entrance are display'd: \nUnmov'd they lie; but, if a blast of wind \nWithout, or vapors issue from behind, \nThe leafs are borne aloft in liquid air, \nAnd she resumes no more her museful care, \nNor gathers from the rocks her scatter'd verse, \nNor sets in order what the winds disperse. \nThus, many not succeeding, most upbraid \nThe madness of the visionary maid, \nAnd with loud curses leave the mystic shade. \n\"'Think it not loss of time a while to stay, \nTho' thy companions chide thy long delay; \nTho' summon'd to the seas, tho' pleasing gales \nInvite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails: \nBut beg the sacred priestess to relate \nWith willing words, and not to write thy fate. \nThe fierce Italian people she will show, \nAnd all thy wars, and all thy future woe, \nAnd what thou may'st avoid, and what must undergo. \nShe shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind, \nAnd teach thee how the happy shores to find. \nThis is what Heav'n allows me to relate: \nNow part in peace; pursue thy better fate, \nAnd raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state.' \n\"This when the priest with friendly voice declar'd, \nHe gave me license, and rich gifts prepar'd: \nBounteous of treasure, he supplied my want \nWith heavy gold, and polish'd elephant; \nThen Dodonaean caldrons put on board, \nAnd ev'ry ship with sums of silver stor'd. \nA trusty coat of mail to me he sent, \nThrice chain'd with gold, for use and ornament; \nThe helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest, \nThat flourish'd with a plume and waving crest. \nNor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends; \nAnd large recruits he to my navy sends: \nMen, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores; \nSupplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars. \nMeantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails, \nLest we should lose the first auspicious gales. \n\"The prophet bless'd the parting crew, and last, \nWith words like these, his ancient friend embrac'd: \n'Old happy man, the care of gods above, \nWhom heav'nly Venus honor'd with her love, \nAnd twice preserv'd thy life, when Troy was lost, \nBehold from far the wish'd Ausonian coast: \nThere land; but take a larger compass round, \nFor that before is all forbidden ground. \nThe shore that Phoebus has design'd for you, \nAt farther distance lies, conceal'd from view. \nGo happy hence, and seek your new abodes, \nBlest in a son, and favor'd by the gods: \nFor I with useless words prolong your stay, \nWhen southern gales have summon'd you away.' \n\"Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor'd, \nNor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord. \nA noble present to my son she brought, \nA robe with flow'rs on golden tissue wrought, \nA phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside \nOf precious texture, and of Asian pride. \n'Accept,' she said, 'these monuments of love, \nWhich in my youth with happier hands I wove: \nRegard these trifles for the giver's sake; \n'T is the last present Hector's wife can make. \nThou call'st my lost Astyanax to mind; \nIn thee his features and his form I find: \nHis eyes so sparkled with a lively flame; \nSuch were his motions; such was all his frame; \nAnd ah! had Heav'n so pleas'd, his years had been the same.'\n\n\"With tears I took my last adieu, and said: \n'Your fortune, happy pair, already made, \nLeaves you no farther wish. My diff'rent state, \nAvoiding one, incurs another fate. \nTo you a quiet seat the gods allow: \nYou have no shores to search, no seas to plow, \nNor fields of flying Italy to chase: \n(Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!) \nYou see another Simois, and enjoy \nThe labor of your hands, another Troy, \nWith better auspice than her ancient tow'rs, \nAnd less obnoxious to the Grecian pow'rs. \nIf e'er the gods, whom I with vows adore, \nConduct my steps to Tiber's happy shore; \nIf ever I ascend the Latian throne, \nAnd build a city I may call my own; \nAs both of us our birth from Troy derive, \nSo let our kindred lines in concord live, \nAnd both in acts of equal friendship strive. \nOur fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same: \nThe double Troy shall differ but in name; \nThat what we now begin may never end, \nBut long to late posterity descend.' \n\"Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore; \nThe shortest passage to th' Italian shore. \nNow had the sun withdrawn his radiant light, \nAnd hills were hid in dusky shades of night: \nWe land, and, on the bosom Of the ground, \nA safe retreat and a bare lodging found. \nClose by the shore we lay; the sailors keep \nTheir watches, and the rest securely sleep. \nThe night, proceeding on with silent pace, \nStood in her noon, and view'd with equal face \nHer steepy rise and her declining race. \nThen wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy \nThe face of heav'n, and the nocturnal sky; \nAnd listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try; \nObserves the stars, and notes their sliding course, \nThe Pleiads, Hyads, and their wat'ry force; \nAnd both the Bears is careful to behold, \nAnd bright Orion, arm'd with burnish'd gold. \nThen, when he saw no threat'ning tempest nigh, \nBut a sure promise of a settled sky, \nHe gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep, \nForsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep. \n\"And now the rising morn with rosy light \nAdorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight; \nWhen we from far, like bluish mists, descry \nThe hills, and then the plains, of Italy. \nAchates first pronounc'd the joyful sound; \nThen, 'Italy!' the cheerful crew rebound. \nMy sire Anchises crown'd a cup with wine, \nAnd, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine: \n'Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas, \nAnd you who raging winds and waves appease, \nBreathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind, \nAnd smooth our passage to the port assign'd!' \nThe gentle gales their flagging force renew, \nAnd now the happy harbor is in view. \nMinerva's temple then salutes our sight, \nPlac'd, as a landmark, on the mountain's height. \nWe furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore; \nThe curling waters round the galleys roar. \nThe land lies open to the raging east, \nThen, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd, \nShuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain, \nAnd vent their malice on the cliffs in vain. \nThe port lies hid within; on either side \nTwo tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide. \nThe temple, which aloft we view'd before, \nTo distance flies, and seems to shun the shore. \nScarce landed, the first omens I beheld \nWere four white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field. \n'War, war is threaten'd from this foreign ground,' \nMy father cried, 'where warlike steeds are found. \nYet, since reclaim'd to chariots they submit, \nAnd bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit, \nPeace may succeed to war.' Our way we bend \nTo Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend; \nThere prostrate to the fierce virago pray, \nWhose temple was the landmark of our way. \nEach with a Phrygian mantle veil'd his head, \nAnd all commands of Helenus obey'd, \nAnd pious rites to Grecian Juno paid. \nThese dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and stand \nTo sea, forsaking that suspected land. \n\"From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view, \nFor Hercules renown'd, if fame be true. \nJust opposite, Lacinian Juno stands; \nCaulonian tow'rs, and Scylacaean strands, \nFor shipwrecks fear'd. Mount Aetna thence we spy, \nKnown by the smoky flames which cloud the sky. \nFar off we hear the waves with surly sound \nInvade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound. \nThe billows break upon the sounding strand, \nAnd roll the rising tide, impure with sand. \nThen thus Anchises, in experience old: \n''T is that Charybdis which the seer foretold, \nAnd those the promis'd rocks! Bear off to sea!' \nWith haste the frighted mariners obey. \nFirst Palinurus to the larboard veer'd; \nThen all the fleet by his example steer'd. \nTo heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride, \nThen down to hell descend, when they divide; \nAnd thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground, \nAnd thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound, \nAnd thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around.\n\nThe flagging winds forsook us, with the sun; \nAnd, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run. \nThe port capacious, and secure from wind, \nIs to the foot of thund'ring Aetna join'd. \nBy turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high; \nBy turns hot embers from her entrails fly, \nAnd flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky. \nOft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown, \nAnd, shiver'd by the force, come piecemeal down. \nOft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow, \nFed from the fiery springs that boil below. \nEnceladus, they say, transfix'd by Jove, \nWith blasted limbs came tumbling from above; \nAnd, where he fell, th' avenging father drew \nThis flaming hill, and on his body threw. \nAs often as he turns his weary sides, \nHe shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides. \nIn shady woods we pass the tedious night, \nWhere bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright, \nOf which no cause is offer'd to the sight; \nFor not one star was kindled in the sky, \nNor could the moon her borrow'd light supply; \nFor misty clouds involv'd the firmament, \nThe stars were muffled, and the moon was pent. \n\"Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal'd, \nScarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell'd, \nWhen from the woods there bolts, before our sight, \nSomewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite, \nSo thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan, \nSo bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man. \nThis thing, all tatter'd, seem'd from far t' implore \nOur pious aid, and pointed to the shore. \nWe look behind, then view his shaggy beard; \nHis clothes were tagg'd with thorns, and filth his limbs besmear'd;\n\nThe rest, in mien, in habit, and in face, \nAppear'd a Greek, and such indeed he was. \nHe cast on us, from far, a frightful view, \nWhom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew; \nStood still, and paus'd; then all at once began \nTo stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran. \nSoon as approach'd, upon his knees he falls, \nAnd thus with tears and sighs for pity calls: \n'Now, by the pow'rs above, and what we share \nFrom Nature's common gift, this vital air, \nO Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more; \nBut bear me far from this unhappy shore. \n'T is true, I am a Greek, and farther own, \nAmong your foes besieg'd th' imperial town. \nFor such demerits if my death be due, \nNo more for this abandon'd life I sue; \nThis only favor let my tears obtain, \nTo throw me headlong in the rapid main: \nSince nothing more than death my crime demands, \nI die content, to die by human hands.' \nHe said, and on his knees my knees embrac'd: \nI bade him boldly tell his fortune past, \nHis present state, his lineage, and his name, \nTh' occasion of his fears, and whence he came. \nThe good Anchises rais'd him with his hand; \nWho, thus encourag'd, answer'd our demand: \n'From Ithaca, my native soil, I came \nTo Troy; and Achaemenides my name. \nMe my poor father with Ulysses sent; \n(O had I stay'd, with poverty content!) \nBut, fearful for themselves, my countrymen \nLeft me forsaken in the Cyclops' den. \nThe cave, tho' large, was dark; the dismal floor \nWas pav'd with mangled limbs and putrid gore. \nOur monstrous host, of more than human size, \nErects his head, and stares within the skies; \nBellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue. \nYe gods, remove this plague from mortal view! \nThe joints of slaughter'd wretches are his food; \nAnd for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood. \nThese eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand \nHe seiz'd two captives of our Grecian band; \nStretch'd on his back, he dash'd against the stones \nTheir broken bodies, and their crackling bones: \nWith spouting blood the purple pavement swims, \nWhile the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs. \n\"'Not unreveng'd Ulysses bore their fate, \nNor thoughtless of his own unhappy state; \nFor, gorg'd with flesh, and drunk with human wine \nWhile fast asleep the giant lay supine, \nSnoring aloud, and belching from his maw \nHis indigested foam, and morsels raw; \nWe pray; we cast the lots, and then surround \nThe monstrous body, stretch'd along the ground: \nEach, as he could approach him, lends a hand \nTo bore his eyeball with a flaming brand. \nBeneath his frowning forehead lay his eye; \nFor only one did the vast frame supply- \nBut that a globe so large, his front it fill'd, \nLike the sun's disk or like a Grecian shield. \nThe stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends: \nThis vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd friends. \nBut haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly! \nYour cables cut, and on your oars rely! \nSuch, and so vast as Polypheme appears, \nA hundred more this hated island bears: \nLike him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep; \nLike him, their herds on tops of mountains keep; \nLike him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep\n\nAnd now three moons their sharpen'd horns renew, \nSince thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view, \nI drag my loathsome days with mortal fright, \nAnd in deserted caverns lodge by night; \nOft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see \nOf the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree: \nFrom far I hear his thund'ring voice resound, \nAnd trampling feet that shake the solid ground. \nCornels and salvage berries of the wood, \nAnd roots and herbs, have been my meager food. \nWhile all around my longing eyes I cast, \nI saw your happy ships appear at last. \nOn those I fix'd my hopes, to these I run; \n'T is all I ask, this cruel race to shun; \nWhat other death you please, yourselves bestow.' \n\"Scarce had he said, when on the mountain's brow \nWe saw the giant shepherd stalk before \nHis following flock, and leading to the shore: \nA monstrous bulk, deform'd, depriv'd of sight; \nHis staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright. \nHis pond'rous whistle from his neck descends; \nHis woolly care their pensive lord attends: \nThis only solace his hard fortune sends. \nSoon as he reach'd the shore and touch'd the waves, \nFrom his bor'd eye the gutt'ring blood he laves: \nHe gnash'd his teeth, and groan'd; thro' seas he strides,\n\nAnd scarce the topmost billows touch'd his sides. \n\"Seiz'd with a sudden fear, we run to sea, \nThe cables cut, and silent haste away; \nThe well-deserving stranger entertain; \nThen, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main. \nThe giant harken'd to the dashing sound: \nBut, when our vessels out of reach he found, \nHe strided onward, and in vain essay'd \nTh' Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade. \nWith that he roar'd aloud: the dreadful cry \nShakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly \nBefore the bellowing noise to distant Italy. \nThe neigh'ring Aetna trembling all around, \nThe winding caverns echo to the sound. \nHis brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar, \nAnd, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore. \nWe saw their stern distorted looks, from far, \nAnd one-eyed glance, that vainly threaten'd war: \nA dreadful council, with their heads on high; \n(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;) \nNot yielding to the tow'ring tree of Jove, \nOr tallest cypress of Diana's grove. \nNew pangs of mortal fear our minds assail; \nWe tug at ev'ry oar, and hoist up ev'ry sail, \nAnd take th' advantage of the friendly gale. \nForewarn'd by Helenus, we strive to shun \nCharybdis' gulf, nor dare to Scylla run. \nAn equal fate on either side appears: \nWe, tacking to the left, are free from fears; \nFor, from Pelorus' point, the North arose, \nAnd drove us back where swift Pantagias flows. \nHis rocky mouth we pass, and make our way \nBy Thapsus and Megara's winding bay. \nThis passage Achaemenides had shown, \nTracing the course which he before had run. \n\"Right o'er against Plemmyrium's wat'ry strand, \nThere lies an isle once call'd th' Ortygian land. \nAlpheus, as old fame reports, has found \nFrom Greece a secret passage under ground, \nBy love to beauteous Arethusa led; \nAnd, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed. \nAs Helenus enjoin'd, we next adore \nDiana's name, protectress of the shore. \nWith prosp'rous gales we pass the quiet sounds \nOf still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds. \nThen, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey \nThe rocky shore extended to the sea. \nThe town of Camarine from far we see, \nAnd fenny lake, undrain'd by fate's decree. \nIn sight of the Geloan fields we pass, \nAnd the large walls, where mighty Gela was; \nThen Agragas, with lofty summits crown'd, \nLong for the race of warlike steeds renown'd. \nWe pass'd Selinus, and the palmy land, \nAnd widely shun the Lilybaean strand, \nUnsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand. \nAt length on shore the weary fleet arriv'd, \nWhich Drepanum's unhappy port receiv'd. \nHere, after endless labors, often toss'd \nBy raging storms, and driv'n on ev'ry coast, \nMy dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost: \nEase of my cares, and solace of my pain, \nSav'd thro' a thousand toils, but sav'd in vain \nThe prophet, who my future woes reveal'd, \nYet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal'd; \nAnd dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill \nDenounc'd all else, was silent of the ill. \nThis my last labor was. Some friendly god \nFrom thence convey'd us to your blest abode.\" \nThus, to the list'ning queen, the royal guest \nHis wand'ring course and all his toils express'd; \nAnd here concluding, he retir'd to rest. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK IV\n\nBut anxious cares already seiz'd the queen: \nShe fed within her veins a flame unseen; \nThe hero's valor, acts, and birth inspire \nHer soul with love, and fan the secret fire. \nHis words, his looks, imprinted in her heart, \nImprove the passion, and increase the smart. \nNow, when the purple morn had chas'd away \nThe dewy shadows, and restor'd the day, \nHer sister first with early care she sought, \nAnd thus in mournful accents eas'd her thought: \n\"My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright \nMy lab'ring soul! what visions of the night \nDisturb my quiet, and distract my breast \nWith strange ideas of our Trojan guest! \nHis worth, his actions, and majestic air, \nA man descended from the gods declare. \nFear ever argues a degenerate kind; \nHis birth is well asserted by his mind. \nThen, what he suffer'd, when by Fate betray'd! \nWhat brave attempts for falling Troy he made! \nSuch were his looks, so gracefully he spoke, \nThat, were I not resolv'd against the yoke \nOf hapless marriage, never to be curst \nWith second love, so fatal was my first, \nTo this one error I might yield again; \nFor, since Sichaeus was untimely slain, \nThis only man is able to subvert \nThe fix'd foundations of my stubborn heart. \nAnd, to confess my frailty, to my shame, \nSomewhat I find within, if not the same, \nToo like the sparkles of my former flame. \nBut first let yawning earth a passage rend, \nAnd let me thro' the dark abyss descend; \nFirst let avenging Jove, with flames from high, \nDrive down this body to the nether sky, \nCondemn'd with ghosts in endless night to lie, \nBefore I break the plighted faith I gave! \nNo! he who had my vows shall ever have; \nFor, whom I lov'd on earth, I worship in the grave.\" \nShe said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes, \nAnd stopp'd her speech. Her sister thus replies: \n\"O dearer than the vital air I breathe, \nWill you to grief your blooming years bequeath, \nCondemn'd to waste in woes your lonely life, \nWithout the joys of mother or of wife? \nThink you these tears, this pompous train of woe, \nAre known or valued by the ghosts below? \nI grant that, while your sorrows yet were green, \nIt well became a woman, and a queen, \nThe vows of Tyrian princes to neglect, \nTo scorn Hyarbas, and his love reject, \nWith all the Libyan lords of mighty name; \nBut will you fight against a pleasing flame! \nThis little spot of land, which Heav'n bestows, \nOn ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes; \nGaetulian cities here are spread around, \nAnd fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound; \nHere lies a barren waste of thirsty land, \nAnd there the Syrtes raise the moving sand; \nBarcaean troops besiege the narrow shore, \nAnd from the sea Pygmalion threatens more. \nPropitious Heav'n, and gracious Juno, lead \nThis wand'ring navy to your needful aid: \nHow will your empire spread, your city rise, \nFrom such a union, and with such allies? \nImplore the favor of the pow'rs above, \nAnd leave the conduct of the rest to love. \nContinue still your hospitable way, \nAnd still invent occasions of their stay, \nTill storms and winter winds shall cease to threat, \nAnd planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet.\" \nThese words, which from a friend and sister came, \nWith ease resolv'd the scruples of her fame, \nAnd added fury to the kindled flame. \nInspir'd with hope, the project they pursue; \nOn ev'ry altar sacrifice renew: \nA chosen ewe of two years old they pay \nTo Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of Day; \nPreferring Juno's pow'r, for Juno ties \nThe nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys. \nThe beauteous queen before her altar stands, \nAnd holds the golden goblet in her hands. \nA milk-white heifer she with flow'rs adorns, \nAnd pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns; \nAnd, while the priests with pray'r the gods invoke, \nShe feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke, \nWith hourly care the sacrifice renews, \nAnd anxiously the panting entrails views. \nWhat priestly rites, alas! what pious art, \nWhat vows avail to cure a bleeding heart! \nA gentle fire she feeds within her veins, \nWhere the soft god secure in silence reigns. \nSick with desire, and seeking him she loves, \nFrom street to street the raving Dido roves. \nSo when the watchful shepherd, from the blind, \nWounds with a random shaft the careless hind, \nDistracted with her pain she flies the woods, \nBounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods, \nWith fruitless care; for still the fatal dart \nSticks in her side, and rankles in her heart. \nAnd now she leads the Trojan chief along \nThe lofty walls, amidst the busy throng; \nDisplays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town, \nWhich love, without his labor, makes his own. \nThis pomp she shows, to tempt her wand'ring guest; \nHer falt'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest. \nWhen day declines, and feasts renew the night, \nStill on his face she feeds her famish'd sight; \nShe longs again to hear the prince relate \nHis own adventures and the Trojan fate. \nHe tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain, \nFor still she begs to hear it once again. \nThe hearer on the speaker's mouth depends, \nAnd thus the tragic story never ends. \nThen, when they part, when Phoebe's paler light \nWithdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite, \nShe last remains, when ev'ry guest is gone, \nSits on the bed he press'd, and sighs alone; \nAbsent, her absent hero sees and hears; \nOr in her bosom young Ascanius bears, \nAnd seeks the father's image in the child, \nIf love by likeness might be so beguil'd. \nMeantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand; \nNo labors exercise the youthful band, \nNor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know; \nThe mole is left unfinish'd to the foe; \nThe mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie, \nShort of their promis'd heighth, that seem'd to threat the sky,\n\nBut when imperial Juno, from above, \nSaw Dido fetter'd in the chains of love, \nHot with the venom which her veins inflam'd, \nAnd by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd, \nWith soothing words to Venus she begun: \n\"High praises, endless honors, you have won, \nAnd mighty trophies, with your worthy son! \nTwo gods a silly woman have undone! \nNor am I ignorant, you both suspect \nThis rising city, which my hands erect: \nBut shall celestial discord never cease? \n'T is better ended in a lasting peace. \nYou stand possess'd of all your soul desir'd: \nPoor Dido with consuming love is fir'd. \nYour Trojan with my Tyrian let us join; \nSo Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine: \nOne common kingdom, one united line. \nEliza shall a Dardan lord obey, \nAnd lofty Carthage for a dow'r convey.\" \nThen Venus, who her hidden fraud descried, \nWhich would the scepter of the world misguide \nTo Libyan shores, thus artfully replied: \n\"Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, \nAnd such alliance and such gifts refuse, \nIf Fortune with our joint desires comply? \nThe doubt is all from Jove and destiny; \nLest he forbid, with absolute command, \nTo mix the people in one common land- \nOr will the Trojan and the Tyrian line \nIn lasting leagues and sure succession join? \nBut you, the partner of his bed and throne, \nMay move his mind; my wishes are your own.\" \n\"Mine,\" said imperial Juno, \"be the care; \nTime urges, now, to perfect this affair: \nAttend my counsel, and the secret share. \nWhen next the Sun his rising light displays, \nAnd gilds the world below with purple rays, \nThe queen, Aeneas, and the Tyrian court \nShall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort. \nThere, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around, \nAnd cheerful horns from side to side resound, \nA pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain \nWith hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain; \nThe fearful train shall take their speedy flight, \nDispers'd, and all involv'd in gloomy night; \nOne cave a grateful shelter shall afford \nTo the fair princess and the Trojan lord. \nI will myself the bridal bed prepare, \nIf you, to bless the nuptials, will be there: \nSo shall their loves be crown'd with due delights, \nAnd Hymen shall be present at the rites.\" \nThe Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles \nAt her vain project, and discover'd wiles. \nThe rosy morn was risen from the main, \nAnd horns and hounds awake the princely train: \nThey issue early thro' the city gate, \nWhere the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait, \nWith nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force \nOf Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse. \nThe Tyrian peers and officers of state \nFor the slow queen in antechambers wait; \nHer lofty courser, in the court below, \nWho his majestic rider seems to know, \nProud of his purple trappings, paws the ground, \nAnd champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around. \nThe queen at length appears; on either hand \nThe brawny guards in martial order stand. \nA flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore, \nAnd at her back a golden quiver bore; \nHer flowing hair a golden caul restrains, \nA golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains. \nThen young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, \nLeads on the Trojan youth to view the chase. \nBut far above the rest in beauty shines \nThe great Aeneas, the troop he joins; \nLike fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost \nOf wint'ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast, \nWhen to his native Delos he resorts, \nOrdains the dances, and renews the sports; \nWhere painted Scythians, mix'd with Cretan bands, \nBefore the joyful altars join their hands: \nHimself, on Cynthus walking, sees below \nThe merry madness of the sacred show. \nGreen wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose; \nA golden fillet binds his awful brows; \nHis quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen \nIn manly presence, or in lofty mien. \nNow had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the seat \nOf salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat. \nThe cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound \nFrom rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground; \nQuite otherwise the stags, a trembling train, \nIn herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain, \nAnd a long chase in open view maintain. \nThe glad Ascanius, as his courser guides, \nSpurs thro' the vale, and these and those outrides. \nHis horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel \nThe clanking lash, and goring of the steel. \nImpatiently he views the feeble prey, \nWishing some nobler beast to cross his way, \nAnd rather would the tusky boar attend, \nOr see the tawny lion downward bend. \nMeantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies: \nFrom pole to pole the forky lightning flies; \nThe rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours \nA wintry deluge down, and sounding show'rs. \nThe company, dispers'd, to converts ride, \nAnd seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow side. \nThe rapid rains, descending from the hills, \nTo rolling torrents raise the creeping rills. \nThe queen and prince, as love or fortune guides, \nOne common cavern in her bosom hides. \nThen first the trembling earth the signal gave, \nAnd flashing fires enlighten all the cave; \nHell from below, and Juno from above, \nAnd howling nymphs, were conscious of their love. \nFrom this ill-omen'd hour in time arose \nDebate and death, and all succeeding woes. \nThe queen, whom sense of honor could not move, \nNo longer made a secret of her love, \nBut call'd it marriage, by that specious name \nTo veil the crime and sanctify the shame. \nThe loud report thro' Libyan cities goes. \nFame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows: \nSwift from the first; and ev'ry moment brings \nNew vigor to her flights, new pinions to her wings. \nSoon grows the pigmy to gigantic size; \nHer feet on earth, her forehead in the skies. \nInrag'd against the gods, revengeful Earth \nProduc'd her last of the Titanian birth. \nSwift is her walk, more swift her winged haste: \nA monstrous phantom, horrible and vast. \nAs many plumes as raise her lofty flight, \nSo many piercing eyes inlarge her sight; \nMillions of opening mouths to Fame belong, \nAnd ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue, \nAnd round with list'ning ears the flying plague is hung.\n\nShe fills the peaceful universe with cries; \nNo slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes; \nBy day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews, \nAnd spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news; \nWith court informers haunts, and royal spies; \nThings done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with\n\nlies. \nTalk is her business, and her chief delight \nTo tell of prodigies and cause affright. \nShe fills the people's ears with Dido's name, \nWho, lost to honor and the sense of shame, \nAdmits into her throne and nuptial bed \nA wand'ring guest, who from his country fled: \nWhole days with him she passes in delights, \nAnd wastes in luxury long winter nights, \nForgetful of her fame and royal trust, \nDissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her lust. \nThe goddess widely spreads the loud report, \nAnd flies at length to King Hyarba's court. \nWhen first possess'd with this unwelcome news \nWhom did he not of men and gods accuse? \nThis prince, from ravish'd Garamantis born, \nA hundred temples did with spoils adorn, \nIn Ammon's honor, his celestial sire; \nA hundred altars fed with wakeful fire; \nAnd, thro' his vast dominions, priests ordain'd, \nWhose watchful care these holy rites maintain'd. \nThe gates and columns were with garlands crown'd, \nAnd blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground. \nHe, when he heard a fugitive could move \nThe Tyrian princess, who disdain'd his love, \nHis breast with fury burn'd, his eyes with fire, \nMad with despair, impatient with desire; \nThen on the sacred altars pouring wine, \nHe thus with pray'rs implor'd his sire divine: \n\"Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race, \nWho feast on painted beds, with off'rings grace \nThy temples, and adore thy pow'r divine \nWith blood of victims, and with sparkling wine, \nSeest thou not this? or do we fear in vain \nThy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign? \nDo thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance? \nThine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance? \nA wand'ring woman builds, within our state, \nA little town, bought at an easy rate; \nShe pays me homage, and my grants allow \nA narrow space of Libyan lands to plow; \nYet, scorning me, by passion blindly led, \nAdmits a banish'd Trojan to her bed! \nAnd now this other Paris, with his train \nOf conquer'd cowards, must in Afric reign! \n(Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess, \nTheir locks with oil perfum'd, their Lydian dress.) \nHe takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame; \nAnd I, rejected I, adore an empty name.\" \nHis vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd, \nAnd held his altar's horns. The mighty Thund'rer heard; \nThen cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found \nThe lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd, \nLost in their loves, insensible of shame, \nAnd both forgetful of their better fame. \nHe calls Cyllenius, and the god attends, \nBy whom his menacing command he sends: \n\"Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky; \nThen, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly: \nThere find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days \nIn slothful not and inglorious ease, \nNor minds the future city, giv'n by fate. \nTo him this message from my mouth relate: \n'Not so fair Venus hop'd, when twice she won \nThy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son. \nHers was a hero, destin'd to command \nA martial race, and rule the Latian land, \nWho should his ancient line from Teucer draw, \nAnd on the conquer'd world impose the law.' \nIf glory cannot move a mind so mean, \nNor future praise from fading pleasure wean, \nYet why should he defraud his son of fame, \nAnd grudge the Romans their immortal name! \nWhat are his vain designs! what hopes he more \nFrom his long ling'ring on a hostile shore, \nRegardless to redeem his honor lost, \nAnd for his race to gain th' Ausonian coast! \nBid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake; \nWith this command the slumb'ring warrior wake.\" \nHermes obeys; with golden pinions binds \nHis flying feet, and mounts the western winds: \nAnd, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies, \nWith rapid force they bear him down the skies. \nBut first he grasps within his awful hand \nThe mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand; \nWith this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves; \nWith this he drives them down the Stygian waves; \nWith this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight, \nAnd eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light. \nThus arm'd, the god begins his airy race, \nAnd drives the racking clouds along the liquid space; \nNow sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies, \nWhose brawny back supports the starry skies; \nAtlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd, \nIs beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors bound. \nSnows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin \nThe founts of rolling streams their race begin; \nA beard of ice on his large breast depends. \nHere, pois'd upon his wings, the god descends: \nThen, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height \nPlung'd downward, with precipitated flight, \nLights on the seas, and skims along the flood. \nAs waterfowl, who seek their fishy food, \nLess, and yet less, to distant prospect show; \nBy turns they dance aloft, and dive below: \nLike these, the steerage of his wings he plies, \nAnd near the surface of the water flies, \nTill, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands, \nHe clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands: \nWhere shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds, \nNow tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads. \nArriving there, he found the Trojan prince \nNew ramparts raising for the town's defense. \nA purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er, \n(Queen Dido's gift,) about his waist he wore; \nA sword, with glitt'ring gems diversified, \nFor ornament, not use, hung idly by his side. \nThen thus, with winged words, the god began, \nResuming his own shape: \"Degenerate man, \nThou woman's property, what mak'st thou here, \nThese foreign walls and Tyrian tow'rs to rear, \nForgetful of thy own? All-pow'rful Jove, \nWho sways the world below and heav'n above, \nHas sent me down with this severe command: \nWhat means thy ling'ring in the Libyan land? \nIf glory cannot move a mind so mean, \nNor future praise from flitting pleasure wean, \nRegard the fortunes of thy rising heir: \nThe promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear, \nTo whom th' Ausonian scepter, and the state \nOf Rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate.\" \nSo spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight, \nInvolv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight. \nThe pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear; \nMute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair. \nRevolving in his mind the stern command, \nHe longs to fly, and loathes the charming land. \nWhat should he say? or how should he begin? \nWhat course, alas! remains to steer between \nTh' offended lover and the pow'rful queen? \nThis way and that he turns his anxious mind, \nAnd all expedients tries, and none can find. \nFix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means, \nAfter long thought, to this advice he leans: \nThree chiefs he calls, commands them to repair \nThe fleet, and ship their men with silent care; \nSome plausible pretense he bids them find, \nTo color what in secret he design'd. \nHimself, meantime, the softest hours would choose, \nBefore the love-sick lady heard the news; \nAnd move her tender mind, by slow degrees, \nTo suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees: \nJove will inspire him, when, and what to say. \nThey hear with pleasure, and with haste obey. \nBut soon the queen perceives the thin disguise: \n(What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes!) \nShe was the first to find the secret fraud, \nBefore the fatal news was blaz'd abroad. \nLove the first motions of the lover hears, \nQuick to presage, and ev'n in safety fears. \nNor impious Fame was wanting to report \nThe ships repair'd, the Trojans' thick resort, \nAnd purpose to forsake the Tyrian court. \nFrantic with fear, impatient of the wound, \nAnd impotent of mind, she roves the city round. \nLess wild the Bacchanalian dames appear, \nWhen, from afar, their nightly god they hear, \nAnd howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear. \nAt length she finds the dear perfidious man; \nPrevents his form'd excuse, and thus began: \n\"Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly, \nAnd undiscover'd scape a lover's eye? \nNor could my kindness your compassion move. \nNor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love? \nOr is the death of a despairing queen \nNot worth preventing, tho' too well foreseen? \nEv'n when the wintry winds command your stay, \nYou dare the tempests, and defy the sea. \nFalse as you are, suppose you were not bound \nTo lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound; \nWere Troy restor'd, and Priam's happy reign, \nNow durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main? \nSee whom you fly! am I the foe you shun? \nNow, by those holy vows, so late begun, \nBy this right hand, (since I have nothing more \nTo challenge, but the faith you gave before;) \nI beg you by these tears too truly shed, \nBy the new pleasures of our nuptial bed; \nIf ever Dido, when you most were kind, \nWere pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind; \nBy these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place, \nPity the fortunes of a falling race. \nFor you I have provok'd a tyrant's hate, \nIncens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state; \nFor you alone I suffer in my fame, \nBereft of honor, and expos'd to shame. \nWhom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest? \n(That only name remains of all the rest!) \nWhat have I left? or whither can I fly? \nMust I attend Pygmalion's cruelty, \nOr till Hyarba shall in triumph lead \nA queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed? \nHad you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight, \nAnd left behind some pledge of our delight, \nSome babe to bless the mother's mournful sight, \nSome young Aeneas, to supply your place, \nWhose features might express his father's face; \nI should not then complain to live bereft \nOf all my husband, or be wholly left.\" \nHere paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes, \nBy Jove's command; nor suffer'd love to rise, \nTho' heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies: \n\"Fair queen, you never can enough repeat \nYour boundless favors, or I own my debt; \nNor can my mind forget Eliza's name, \nWhile vital breath inspires this mortal frame. \nThis only let me speak in my defense: \nI never hop'd a secret flight from hence, \nMuch less pretended to the lawful claim \nOf sacred nuptials, or a husband's name. \nFor, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free, \nAnd not submit my life to fate's decree, \nMy choice would lead me to the Trojan shore, \nThose relics to review, their dust adore, \nAnd Priam's ruin'd palace to restore. \nBut now the Delphian oracle commands, \nAnd fate invites me to the Latian lands. \nThat is the promis'd place to which I steer, \nAnd all my vows are terminated there. \nIf you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born, \nWith walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn, \nWhy may not we- like you, a foreign race- \nLike you, seek shelter in a foreign place? \nAs often as the night obscures the skies \nWith humid shades, or twinkling stars arise, \nAnchises' angry ghost in dreams appears, \nChides my delay, and fills my soul with fears; \nAnd young Ascanius justly may complain \nOf his defrauded and destin'd reign. \nEv'n now the herald of the gods appear'd: \nWaking I saw him, and his message heard. \nFrom Jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright \nWith radiant beams, and manifest to sight \n(The sender and the sent I both attest) \nThese walls he enter'd, and those words express'd. \nFair queen, oppose not what the gods command; \nForc'd by my fate, I leave your happy land.\" \nThus while he spoke, already she began, \nWith sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man; \nFrom head to foot survey'd his person o'er, \nNor longer these outrageous threats forebore: \n\"False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn! \nNot sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born, \nBut hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock! \nAnd rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck! \nWhy should I fawn? what have I worse to fear? \nDid he once look, or lent a list'ning ear, \nSigh'd when I sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?- \nAll symptoms of a base ungrateful mind, \nSo foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find. \nOf man's injustice why should I complain? \nThe gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain \nTriumphant treason; yet no thunder flies, \nNor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes; \nFaithless is earth, and faithless are the skies! \nJustice is fled, and Truth is now no more! \nI sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore; \nWith needful food his hungry Trojans fed; \nI took the traitor to my throne and bed: \nFool that I was- 't is little to repeat \nThe rest- I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet. \nI rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads, \nAnd makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds. \nNow Lycian lots, and now the Delian god, \nNow Hermes is employ'd from Jove's abode, \nTo warn him hence; as if the peaceful state \nOf heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate! \nBut go! thy flight no longer I detain- \nGo seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main! \nYet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow, \nThe faithless waves, not half so false as thou, \nOr secret sands, shall sepulchers afford \nTo thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd lord. \nThen shalt thou call on injur'd Dido's name: \nDido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame, \nWhen death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame; \nShall smile to see the traitor vainly weep: \nHer angry ghost, arising from the deep, \nShall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep. \nAt least my shade thy punishment shall know, \nAnd Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.\" \nAbruptly here she stops; then turns away \nHer loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day. \nAmaz'd he stood, revolving in his mind \nWhat speech to frame, and what excuse to find. \nHer fearful maids their fainting mistress led, \nAnd softly laid her on her ivory bed. \nBut good Aeneas, tho' he much desir'd \nTo give that pity which her grief requir'd; \nTho' much he mourn'd, and labor'd with his love, \nResolv'd at length, obeys the will of Jove; \nReviews his forces: they with early care \nUnmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare. \nThe fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride, \nAnd well-calk'd galleys in the harbor ride. \nThen oaks for oars they fell'd; or, as they stood, \nOf its green arms despoil'd the growing wood, \nStudious of flight. The beach is cover'd o'er \nWith Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore: \nOn ev'ry side are seen, descending down, \nThick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town. \nThus, in battalia, march embodied ants, \nFearful of winter, and of future wants, \nT' invade the corn, and to their cells convey \nThe plunder'd forage of their yellow prey. \nThe sable troops, along the narrow tracks, \nScarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs: \nSome set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain; \nSome guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train; \nAll ply their sev'ral tasks, and equal toil sustain. \nWhat pangs the tender breast of Dido tore, \nWhen, from the tow'r, she saw the cover'd shore, \nAnd heard the shouts of sailors from afar, \nMix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war! \nAll-pow'rful Love! what changes canst thou cause \nIn human hearts, subjected to thy laws! \nOnce more her haughty soul the tyrant bends: \nTo pray'rs and mean submissions she descends. \nNo female arts or aids she left untried, \nNor counsels unexplor'd, before she died. \n\"Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea; \nThey spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh. \nThe shouting crew their ships with garlands bind, \nInvoke the sea gods, and invite the wind. \nCould I have thought this threat'ning blow so near, \nMy tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear. \nBut do not you my last request deny; \nWith yon perfidious man your int'rest try, \nAnd bring me news, if I must live or die. \nYou are his fav'rite; you alone can find \nThe dark recesses of his inmost mind: \nIn all his trusted secrets you have part, \nAnd know the soft approaches to his heart. \nHaste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe; \nTell him, I did not with the Grecians go, \nNor did my fleet against his friends employ, \nNor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy, \nNor mov'd with hands profane his father's dust: \nWhy should he then reject a just! \nWhom does he shun, and whither would he fly! \nCan he this last, this only pray'r deny! \nLet him at least his dang'rous flight delay, \nWait better winds, and hope a calmer sea. \nThe nuptials he disclaims I urge no more: \nLet him pursue the promis'd Latian shore. \nA short delay is all I ask him now; \nA pause of grief, an interval from woe, \nTill my soft soul be temper'd to sustain \nAccustom'd sorrows, and inur'd to pain. \nIf you in pity grant this one request, \nMy death shall glut the hatred of his breast.\" \nThis mournful message pious Anna bears, \nAnd seconds with her own her sister's tears: \nBut all her arts are still employ'd in vain; \nAgain she comes, and is refus'd again. \nHis harden'd heart nor pray'rs nor threat'nings move; \nFate, and the god, had stopp'd his ears to love. \nAs, when the winds their airy quarrel try, \nJustling from ev'ry quarter of the sky, \nThis way and that the mountain oak they bend, \nHis boughs they shatter, and his branches rend; \nWith leaves and falling mast they spread the ground; \nThe hollow valleys echo to the sound: \nUnmov'd, the royal plant their fury mocks, \nOr, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks; \nFar as he shoots his tow'ring head on high, \nSo deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie. \nNo less a storm the Trojan hero bears; \nThick messages and loud complaints he hears, \nAnd bandied words, still beating on his ears. \nSighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains; \nBut the firm purpose of his heart remains. \nThe wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate, \nBegins at length the light of heav'n to hate, \nAnd loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees, \nTo hasten on the death her soul decrees: \nStrange to relate! for when, before the shrine, \nShe pours in sacrifice the purple wine, \nThe purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood, \nAnd the white offer'd milk converts to mud. \nThis dire presage, to her alone reveal'd, \nFrom all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd. \nA marble temple stood within the grove, \nSacred to death, and to her murther'd love; \nThat honor'd chapel she had hung around \nWith snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown'd: \nOft, when she visited this lonely dome, \nStrange voices issued from her husband's tomb; \nShe thought she heard him summon her away, \nInvite her to his grave, and chide her stay. \nHourly 't is heard, when with a boding note \nThe solitary screech owl strains her throat, \nAnd, on a chimney's top, or turret's height, \nWith songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night. \nBesides, old prophecies augment her fears; \nAnd stern Aeneas in her dreams appears, \nDisdainful as by day: she seems, alone, \nTo wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown, \nGuideless and dark; or, in a desart plain, \nTo seek her subjects, and to seek in vain: \nLike Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear, \nHe saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear; \nOr mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost \nFull in his face infernal torches toss'd, \nAnd shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight, \nFlies o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright; \nThe Furies guard the door and intercept his flight. \nNow, sinking underneath a load of grief, \nFrom death alone she seeks her last relief; \nThe time and means resolv'd within her breast, \nShe to her mournful sister thus address'd \n(Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears, \nAnd a false vigor in her eyes appears): \n\"Rejoice!\" she said. \"Instructed from above, \nMy lover I shall gain, or lose my love. \nNigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun, \nLong tracts of Ethiopian climates run: \nThere a Massylian priestess I have found, \nHonor'd for age, for magic arts renown'd: \nTh' Hesperian temple was her trusted care; \n'T was she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare. \nShe poppy seeds in honey taught to steep, \nReclaim'd his rage, and sooth'd him into sleep. \nShe watch'd the golden fruit; her charms unbind \nThe chains of love, or fix them on the mind: \nShe stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry, \nRepels the stars, and backward bears the sky. \nThe yawning earth rebellows to her call, \nPale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall. \nWitness, ye gods, and thou my better part, \nHow loth I am to try this impious art! \nWithin the secret court, with silent care, \nErect a lofty pile, expos'd in air: \nHang on the topmost part the Trojan vest, \nSpoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest. \nNext, under these, the bridal bed be plac'd, \nWhere I my ruin in his arms embrac'd: \nAll relics of the wretch are doom'd to fire; \nFor so the priestess and her charms require.\" \nThus far she said, and farther speech forbears; \nA mortal paleness in her face appears: \nYet the mistrustless Anna could not find \nThe secret fun'ral in these rites design'd; \nNor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind. \nUnknowing of a train conceal'd so well, \nShe fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell; \nTherefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear, \nWithin the secret court, expos'd in air. \nThe cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high, \nAnd garlands on the hollow spaces lie. \nSad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath, \nAnd ev'ry baleful green denoting death. \nThe queen, determin'd to the fatal deed, \nThe spoils and sword he left, in order spread, \nAnd the man's image on the nuptial bed. \nAnd now (the sacred altars plac'd around) \nThe priestess enters, with her hair unbound, \nAnd thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground. \nNight, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims, \nAnd threefold Hecate, with her hundred names, \nAnd three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round \nWith feign'd Avernian drops the hallow'd ground; \nCulls hoary simples, found by Phoebe's light, \nWith brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night; \nThen mixes baleful juices in the bowl, \nAnd cuts the forehead of a newborn foal, \nRobbing the mother's love. The destin'd queen \nObserves, assisting at the rites obscene; \nA leaven'd cake in her devoted hands \nShe holds, and next the highest altar stands: \nOne tender foot was shod, her other bare; \nGirt was her gather'd gown, and loose her hair. \nThus dress'd, she summon'd, with her dying breath, \nThe heav'ns and planets conscious of her death, \nAnd ev'ry pow'r, if any rules above, \nWho minds, or who revenges, injur'd love. \n\"'T was dead of night, when weary bodies close \nTheir eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose: \nThe winds no longer whisper thro' the woods, \nNor murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods. \nThe stars in silent order mov'd around; \nAnd Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground \nThe flocks and herds, and party-color'd fowl, \nWhich haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool, \nStretch'd on the quiet earth, securely lay, \nForgetting the past labors of the day. \nAll else of nature's common gift partake: \nUnhappy Dido was alone awake. \nNor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find; \nSleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind. \nDespair, and rage, and love divide her heart; \nDespair and rage had some, but love the greater part. \nThen thus she said within her secret mind: \n\"What shall I do? what succor can I find? \nBecome a suppliant to Hyarba's pride, \nAnd take my turn, to court and be denied? \nShall I with this ungrateful Trojan go, \nForsake an empire, and attend a foe? \nHimself I refug'd, and his train reliev'd- \n'T is true- but am I sure to be receiv'd? \nCan gratitude in Trojan souls have place! \nLaomedon still lives in all his race! \nThen, shall I seek alone the churlish crew, \nOr with my fleet their flying sails pursue? \nWhat force have I but those whom scarce before \nI drew reluctant from their native shore? \nWill they again embark at my desire, \nOnce more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre? \nRather with steel thy guilty breast invade, \nAnd take the fortune thou thyself hast made. \nYour pity, sister, first seduc'd my mind, \nOr seconded too well what I design'd. \nThese dear-bought pleasures had I never known, \nHad I continued free, and still my own; \nAvoiding love, I had not found despair, \nBut shar'd with salvage beasts the common air. \nLike them, a lonely life I might have led, \nNot mourn'd the living, nor disturb'd the dead.\" \nThese thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast. \nOn board, the Trojan found more easy rest. \nResolv'd to sail, in sleep he pass'd the night; \nAnd order'd all things for his early flight. \nTo whom once more the winged god appears; \nHis former youthful mien and shape he wears, \nAnd with this new alarm invades his ears: \n\"Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown \nThy needful cares, so near a hostile town, \nBeset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales \nInvite thy passage, and inspire thy sails? \nShe harbors in her heart a furious hate, \nAnd thou shalt find the dire effects too late; \nFix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die. \nHaste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly. \nThe sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er, \nAnd blazing firebrands kindle all the shore. \nPrevent her rage, while night obscures the skies, \nAnd sail before the purple morn arise. \nWho knows what hazards thy delay may bring? \nWoman's a various and a changeful thing.\" \nThus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight \nAloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night. \nTwice warn'd by the celestial messenger, \nThe pious prince arose with hasty fear; \nThen rous'd his drowsy train without delay: \n\"Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh, \nAnd spread your flying sails, and stand to sea. \nA god commands: he stood before my sight, \nAnd urg'd us once again to speedy flight. \nO sacred pow'r, what pow'r soe'er thou art, \nTo thy blest orders I resign my heart. \nLead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands, \nAnd prosper the design thy will commands.\" \nHe said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword, \nHis thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord. \nAn emulating zeal inspires his train: \nThey run; they snatch; they rush into the main. \nWith headlong haste they leave the desert shores, \nAnd brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars. \nAurora now had left her saffron bed, \nAnd beams of early light the heav'ns o'erspread, \nWhen, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful eyes, \nSaw day point upward from the rosy skies. \nShe look'd to seaward; but the sea was void, \nAnd scarce in ken the sailing ships descried. \nStung with despite, and furious with despair, \nShe struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair. \n\"And shall th' ungrateful traitor go,\" she said, \n\"My land forsaken, and my love betray'd? \nShall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street, \nTo follow, sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet? \nHaste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe! \nBring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row! \nWhat have I said? where am I? Fury turns \nMy brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns. \nThen, when I gave my person and my throne, \nThis hate, this rage, had been more timely shown. \nSee now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name, \nThe pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame, \nPreserv'd his gods, and to the Phrygian shore \nThe burthen of his feeble father bore! \nI should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods \nHis scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods; \nDestroy'd his friends and son; and, from the fire, \nHave set the reeking boy before the sire. \nEvents are doubtful, which on battles wait: \nYet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate? \nMy Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command, \nHad toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band; \nAt once extinguish'd all the faithless name; \nAnd I myself, in vengeance of my shame, \nHad fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame. \nThou Sun, who view'st at once the world below; \nThou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow; \nThou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes! \nYe Furies, fiends, and violated gods, \nAll pow'rs invok'd with Dido's dying breath, \nAttend her curses and avenge her death! \nIf so the Fates ordain, Jove commands, \nTh' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands, \nYet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes, \nHis peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose: \nOppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field, \nHis men discourag'd, and himself expell'd, \nLet him for succor sue from place to place, \nTorn from his subjects, and his son's embrace. \nFirst, let him see his friends in battle slain, \nAnd their untimely fate lament in vain; \nAnd when, at length, the cruel war shall cease, \nOn hard conditions may he buy his peace: \nNor let him then enjoy supreme command; \nBut fall, untimely, by some hostile hand, \nAnd lie unburied on the barren sand! \nThese are my pray'rs, and this my dying will; \nAnd you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil. \nPerpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim, \nAgainst the prince, the people, and the name. \nThese grateful off'rings on my grave bestow; \nNor league, nor love, the hostile nations know! \nNow, and from hence, in ev'ry future age, \nWhen rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage\n\nRise some avenger of our Libyan blood, \nWith fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood; \nOur arms, our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs; \nAnd the same hate descend on all our heirs!\" \nThis said, within her anxious mind she weighs \nThe means of cutting short her odious days. \nThen to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said \n(For, when she left her country, hers was dead): \n\"Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care \nThe solemn rites of sacrifice prepare; \nThe sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring, \nSprinkling her body from the crystal spring \nWith living drops; then let her come, and thou \nWith sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow. \nThus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove, \nAnd end the cares of my disastrous love; \nThen cast the Trojan image on the fire, \nAnd, as that burns, my passions shall expire.\" \nThe nurse moves onward, with officious care, \nAnd all the speed her aged limbs can bear. \nBut furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd, \nShook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd. \nWith livid spots distinguish'd was her face; \nRed were her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace; \nGhastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her breath, \nAnd nature shiver'd at approaching death. \nThen swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd, \nAnd mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste; \nUnsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind \n(Not for so dire an enterprise design'd). \nBut when she view'd the garments loosely spread, \nWhich once he wore, and saw the conscious bed, \nShe paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd; \nThen on the couch her trembling body cast, \nRepress'd the ready tears, and spoke her last: \n\"Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so pleas'd, \nReceive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd: \nMy fatal course is finish'd; and I go, \nA glorious name, among the ghosts below. \nA lofty city by my hands is rais'd, \nPygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd. \nWhat could my fortune have afforded more, \nHad the false Trojan never touch'd my shore!\" \nThen kiss'd the couch; and, \"Must I die,\" she said, \n\"And unreveng'd? 'T is doubly to be dead! \nYet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive: \nOn any terms, 't is better than to live. \nThese flames, from far, may the false Trojan view; \nThese boding omens his base flight pursue!\" \nShe said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side \nThe piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed: \nClogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands; \nThe spouting blood came streaming on her hands. \nHer sad attendants saw the deadly stroke, \nAnd with loud cries the sounding palace shook. \nDistracted, from the fatal sight they fled, \nAnd thro' the town the dismal rumor spread. \nFirst from the frighted court the yell began; \nRedoubled, thence from house to house it ran: \nThe groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries \nOf mixing women, mount the vaulted skies. \nNot less the clamor, than if- ancient Tyre, \nOr the new Carthage, set by foes on fire- \nThe rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes, \nInvolv'd the blazing temples of their gods. \nHer sister hears; and, furious with despair, \nShe beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair, \nAnd, calling on Eliza's name aloud, \nRuns breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd. \n\"Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd; \nThese fires, this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd? \nWas all this train of plots contriv'd,\" said she, \n\"All only to deceive unhappy me? \nWhich is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend \nTo scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend? \nThy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come; \nOne sword had serv'd us both, one common tomb: \nWas I to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke, \nNot to be present at the fatal stroke? \nAt once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me, \nThy town, thy senate, and thy colony! \nBring water; bathe the wound; while I in death \nLay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath.\"\n\nThis said, she mounts the pile with eager haste, \nAnd in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd; \nHer temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore, \nTo stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore. \nThrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head, \nAnd, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed; \nThrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light, \nBut, having found it, sicken'd at the sight, \nAnd clos'd her lids at last in endless night. \nThen Juno, grieving that she should sustain \nA death so ling'ring, and so full of pain, \nSent Iris down, to free her from the strife \nOf lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life. \nFor since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree, \nOr her own crime, but human casualty, \nAnd rage of love, that plung'd her in despair, \nThe Sisters had not cut the topmost hair, \nWhich Proserpine and they can only know; \nNor made her sacred to the shades below. \nDownward the various goddess took her flight, \nAnd drew a thousand colors from the light; \nThen stood above the dying lover's head, \nAnd said: \"I thus devote thee to the dead. \nThis off'ring to th' infernal gods I bear.\" \nThus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair: \nThe struggling soul was loos'd, and life dissolv'd in air.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK V\n\nMeantime the Trojan cuts his wat'ry way, \nFix'd on his voyage, thro' the curling sea; \nThen, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, \nSees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze. \nThe cause unknown; yet his presaging mind \nThe fate of Dido from the fire divin'd; \nHe knew the stormy souls of womankind, \nWhat secret springs their eager passions move, \nHow capable of death for injur'd love. \nDire auguries from hence the Trojans draw; \nTill neither fires nor shining shores they saw. \nNow seas and skies their prospect only bound; \nAn empty space above, a floating field around. \nBut soon the heav'ns with shadows were o'erspread; \nA swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head: \nLivid it look'd, the threat'ning of a storm: \nThen night and horror ocean's face deform. \nThe pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud: \n\"What gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud \nMy thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars, \nStand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars; \nContract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.\" \nThe frighted crew perform the task assign'd. \nThen, to his fearless chief: \"Not Heav'n,\" said he, \n\"Tho' Jove himself should promise Italy, \nCan stem the torrent of this raging sea. \nMark how the shifting winds from west arise, \nAnd what collected night involves the skies! \nNor can our shaken vessels live at sea, \nMuch less against the tempest force their way. \n'T is fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey. \nNot far from hence, if I observ'd aright \nThe southing of the stars, and polar light, \nSicilia lies, whose hospitable shores \nIn safety we may reach with struggling oars.\" \nAeneas then replied: \"Too sure I find \nWe strive in vain against the seas and wind: \nNow shift your sails; what place can please me more \nThan what you promise, the Sicilian shore, \nWhose hallow'd earth Anchises' bones contains, \nAnd where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?\" \nThe course resolv'd, before the western wind \nThey scud amain, and make the port assign'd. \nMeantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, \nBeheld the fleet descending on the land; \nAnd, not unmindful of his ancient race, \nDown from the cliff he ran with eager pace, \nAnd held the hero in a strict embrace. \nOf a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, \nAnd either hand a pointed jav'lin bore. \nHis mother was a dame of Dardan blood; \nHis sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood. \nHe welcomes his returning friends ashore \nWith plenteous country cates and homely store. \nNow, when the following morn had chas'd away \nThe flying stars, and light restor'd the day, \nAeneas call'd the Trojan troops around, \nAnd thus bespoke them from a rising ground: \n\"Offspring of heav'n, divine Dardanian race! \nThe sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal space, \nThe shining circle of the year has fill'd, \nSince first this isle my father's ashes held: \nAnd now the rising day renews the year; \nA day for ever sad, for ever dear. \nThis would I celebrate with annual games, \nWith gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames, \nTho' banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands, \nCaught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands: \nBut since this happy storm our fleet has driv'n \n(Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav'n) \nUpon these friendly shores and flow'ry plains, \nWhich hide Anchises and his blest remains, \nLet us with joy perform his honors due, \nAnd pray for prosp'rous winds, our voyage to renew; \nPray, that in towns and temples of our own, \nThe name of great Anchises may be known, \nAnd yearly games may spread the gods' renown. \nOur sports Acestes, of the Trojan race, \nWith royal gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace: \nTwo steers on ev'ry ship the king bestows; \nHis gods and ours shall share your equal vows. \nBesides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn \nShall with unclouded light the skies adorn, \nThat day with solemn sports I mean to grace: \nLight galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race; \nSome shall in swiftness for the goal contend, \nAnd others try the twanging bow to bend; \nThe strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand \nOppos'd in combat on the yellow sand. \nLet all be present at the games prepar'd, \nAnd joyful victors wait the just reward. \nBut now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd.\" \nHe said, and first his brows with myrtle bound. \nThen Helymus, by his example led, \nAnd old Acestes, each adorn'd his head; \nThus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, \nHis temples tied, and all the Trojan race. \nAeneas then advanc'd amidst the train, \nBy thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain, \nTo great Anchises' tomb; which when he found, \nHe pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd ground, \nTwo bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more, \nAnd two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore, \nWith roses then the sepulcher he strow'd \nAnd thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud: \n\"Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again, \nPaternal ashes, now review'd in vain! \nThe gods permitted not, that you, with me, \nShould reach the promis'd shores of Italy, \nOr Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be.\" \nScarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride, \nA serpent from the tomb began to glide; \nHis hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd; \nBlue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold:\n\nThus riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass \nA rolling fire along, and singe the grass. \nMore various colors thro' his body run, \nThan Iris when her bow imbibes the sun. \nBetwixt the rising altars, and around, \nThe sacred monster shot along the ground; \nWith harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd, \nAnd with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste: \nThus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest \nWithin the hollow tomb retir'd to rest. \nThe pious prince, surpris'd at what he view'd, \nThe fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd, \nDoubtful if this place's genius were, \nOr guardian of his father's sepulcher. \nFive sheep, according to the rites, he slew; \nAs many swine, and steers of sable hue; \nNew gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd. \nAnd call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd. \nThe glad attendants in long order come, \nOff'ring their gifts at great Anchises' tomb: \nSome add more oxen: some divide the spoil; \nSome place the chargers on the grassy soil; \nSome blow the fires, and off entrails broil. \nNow came the day desir'd. The skies were bright \nWith rosy luster of the rising light: \nThe bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame \nOf Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name, \nThe crowded shore with acclamations fill, \nPart to behold, and part to prove their skill. \nAnd first the gifts in public view they place, \nGreen laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace: \nWithin the circle, arms and tripods lie, \nIngots of gold and silver, heap'd on high, \nAnd vests embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye. \nThe trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims, \nAnd all prepare for their appointed games. \nFour galleys first, which equal rowers bear, \nAdvancing, in the wat'ry lists appear. \nThe speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind, \nBore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind: \nGyas the vast Chimaera's bulk commands, \nWhich rising, like a tow'ring city stands; \nThree Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar; \nThree banks in three degrees the sailors bore; \nBeneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar. \nSergesthus, who began the Sergian race, \nIn the great Centaur took the leading place; \nCloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood, \nFrom whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood. \nFar in the sea, against the foaming shore, \nThere stands a rock: the raging billows roar \nAbove his head in storms; but, when 't is clear, \nUncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear. \nIn peace below the gentle waters run; \nThe cormorants above lie basking in the sun. \nOn this the hero fix'd an oak in sight, \nThe mark to guide the mariners aright. \nTo bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars; \nThen round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.\n\nThe lots decide their place. Above the rest, \nEach leader shining in his Tyrian vest; \nThe common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs \nTheir temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows: \nBesmear'd with oil, their naked shoulders shine. \nAll take their seats, and wait the sounding sign: \nThey gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast \nIs rais'd by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress'd.\n\nThe clangor of the trumpet gives the sign; \nAt once they start, advancing in a line: \nWith shouts the sailors rend the starry skies; \nLash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise; \nSparkles the briny main, and the vex'd ocean fries. \nExact in time, with equal strokes they row: \nAt once the brushing oars and brazen prow \nDash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below. \nNot fiery coursers, in a chariot race, \nInvade the field with half so swift a pace; \nNot the fierce driver with more fury lends \nThe sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends, \nLow to the wheels his pliant body bends. \nThe partial crowd their hopes and fears divide, \nAnd aid with eager shouts the favor'd side. \nCries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound, \nFrom woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound. \nAmidst the loud applauses of the shore, \nGyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before: \nCloanthus, better mann'd, pursued him fast, \nBut his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste. \nThe Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine \nWith equal oars, advancing in a line; \nAnd now the mighty Centaur seems to lead, \nAnd now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead; \nNow board to board the rival vessels row, \nThe billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below. \nThey reach'd the mark. Proud Gyas and his train \nIn triumph rode, the victors of the main; \nBut, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand \nMore close to shore, and skim along the sand- \n\"Let others bear to sea!\" Menoetes heard; \nBut secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd, \nAnd, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd.\n\nWith louder cries the captain call'd again: \n\"Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main.\" \nHe spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw \nThe bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw. \nBetwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood, \nAnd in a closer compass plow'd the flood. \nHe pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before: \nGyas blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore, \nCried out for anger, and his hair he tore. \nMindless of others' lives (so high was grown \nHis rising rage) and careless of his own, \nThe trembling dotard to the deck he drew; \nThen hoisted up, and overboard he threw: \nThis done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows cheer'd, \nTurn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd. \nHardly his head the plunging pilot rears, \nClogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his years: \nNow dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain. \nThe crowd, that saw him fall and float again, \nShout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd, \nTo see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught. \nThe following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew, \nTheir vanish'd hopes of victory renew; \nWhile Gyas lags, they kindle in the race, \nTo reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place; \nMnestheus pursues; and while around they wind, \nComes up, not half his galley's length behind; \nThen, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd, \nAnd thus their drooping courage he cheer'd: \n\"My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore, \nExert your vigor; tug the lab'ring oar; \nStretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew, \nWhom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew. \nIn this, our common int'rest, let me find \nThat strength of hand, that courage of the mind, \nAs when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood, \nAnd o'er the Syrtes' broken billows row'd. \nI seek not now the foremost palm to gain; \nTho' yet- but, ah! that haughty wish is vain! \nLet those enjoy it whom the gods ordain. \nBut to be last, the lags of all the race!- \nRedeem yourselves and me from that disgrace.\" \nNow, one and all, they tug amain; they row \nAt the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow. \nThe sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides \nAre swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides. \nChance aids their daring with unhop'd success; \nSergesthus, eager with his beak to press \nBetwixt the rival galley and the rock, \nShuts up th' unwieldly Centaur in the lock. \nThe vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock, \nHer oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke. \nThe trembling rowers from their banks arise, \nAnd, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize. \nWith iron poles they heave her off the shores, \nAnd gather from the sea their floating oars. \nThe crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds, \nUrge their success, and call the willing winds; \nThen ply their oars, and cut their liquid way \nIn larger compass on the roomy sea. \nAs, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes, \nRous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes; \nThe cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies, \nAnd leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies: \nAt first she flutters; but at length she springs \nTo smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings: \nSo Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea; \nAnd, flying with a force, that force assists his way. \nSergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd, \nWedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast. \nIn vain the victor he with cries implores, \nAnd practices to row with shatter'd oars. \nThen Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies: \nThe ship, without a pilot, yields the prize. \nUnvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains; \nHer he pursues, and all his vigor strains. \nShouts from the fav'ring multitude arise; \nApplauding Echo to the shouts replies; \nShouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro' the skies.\n\nThese clamors with disdain the Scylla heard, \nMuch grudg'd the praise, but more the robb'd reward: \nResolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace, \nAll obstinate to die, or gain the race. \nRais'd with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran; \nFor they can conquer, who believe they can. \nBoth urge their oars, and fortune both supplies, \nAnd both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize; \nWhen to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands, \nAnd succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands: \n\"Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row! \nIf, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow, \nAssist to make me guilty of my vow! \nA snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain; \nHis offer'd entrails cast into the main, \nAnd ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown, \nYour grateful gift and my return shall own.\" \nThe choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below, \nWith virgin Panopea, heard his vow; \nAnd old Portunus, with his breadth of hand, \nPush'd on, and sped the galley to the land. \nSwift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies, \nAnd, darting to the port, obtains the prize. \nThe herald summons all, and then proclaims \nCloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games. \nThe prince with laurel crowns the victor's head, \nAnd three fat steers are to his vessel led, \nThe ship's reward; with gen'rous wine beside, \nAnd sums of silver, which the crew divide. \nThe leaders are distinguish'd from the rest; \nThe victor honor'd with a nobler vest, \nWhere gold and purple strive in equal rows, \nAnd needlework its happy cost bestows. \nThere Ganymede is wrought with living art, \nChasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart: \nBreathless he seems, yet eager to pursue; \nWhen from aloft descends, in open view, \nThe bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey, \nWith crooked talons bears the boy away. \nIn vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes, \nHis guards behold him soaring thro' the skies, \nAnd dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries. \nMnestheus the second victor was declar'd; \nAnd, summon'd there, the second prize he shard. \nA coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore, \nMore brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore, \nIn single combat on the Trojan shore: \nThis was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess; \nIn war for his defense, for ornament in peace. \nRich was the gift, and glorious to behold, \nBut yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold, \nThat scarce two servants could the weight sustain; \nYet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain \nPursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train. \nThe third, succeeding to the last reward, \nTwo goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd, \nWith figures prominent, and richly wrought, \nAnd two brass caldrons from Dodona brought. \nThus all, rewarded by the hero's hands, \nTheir conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands; \nAnd now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock, \nBrought back his galley shatter'd with the shock. \nForlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar, \nAnd, houted by the vulgar, made to shore. \nAs when a snake, surpris'd upon the road, \nIs crush'd athwart her body by the load \nOf heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound \nHer belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground: \nIn vain, with loosen'd curls, she crawls along; \nYet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue; \nGlares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales; \nBut, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:\n\nSo slowly to the port the Centaur tends, \nBut, what she wants in oars, with sails amends. \nYet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful prince \nIs pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense. \nPholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care, \nBeauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair. \nFrom thence his way the Trojan hero bent \nInto the neighb'ring plain, with mountains pent, \nWhose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. \nFull in the midst of this fair valley stood \nA native theater, which, rising slow \nBy just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below. \nHigh on a sylvan throne the leader sate; \nA num'rous train attend in solemn state. \nHere those that in the rapid course delight, \nDesire of honor and the prize invite. \nThe rival runners without order stand; \nThe Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band. \nFirst Nisus, with Euryalus, appears; \nEuryalus a boy of blooming years, \nWith sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd; \nNisus, for friendship to the youth renown'd. \nDiores next, of Priam's royal race, \nThen Salius joined with Patron, took their place; \n(But Patron in Arcadia had his birth, \nAnd Salius his from Arcananian earth;) \nThen two Sicilian youths- the names of these, \nSwift Helymus, and lovely Panopes: \nBoth jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred, \nAnd owning old Acestes for their head; \nWith sev'ral others of ignobler name, \nWhom time has not deliver'd o'er to fame. \nTo these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd, \nIn words which gen'ral approbation gain'd: \n\"One common largess is for all design'd, \n(The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,) \nTwo darts of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood, \nA silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd. \nThe foremost three have olive wreaths decreed: \nThe first of these obtains a stately steed, \nAdorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame, \nThe quiver of an Amazonian dame, \nWith feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied: \nA golden belt shall gird his manly side, \nWhich with a sparkling diamond shall be tied. \nThe third this Grecian helmet shall content.\" \nHe said. To their appointed base they went; \nWith beating hearts th' expected sign receive, \nAnd, starting all at once, the barrier leave. \nSpread out, as on the winged winds, they flew, \nAnd seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view. \nShot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'erpass'd; \nNor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste. \nThe next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd, \nCame Salius, and Euryalus behind; \nThen Helymus, whom young Diores plied, \nStep after step, and almost side by side, \nHis shoulders pressing; and, in longer space, \nHad won, or left at least a dubious race. \nNow, spent, the goal they almost reach at last, \nWhen eager Nisus, hapless in his haste, \nSlipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain, \nSoak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain. \nThe careless victor had not mark'd his way; \nBut, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay, \nHis heels flew up; and on the grassy floor \nHe fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore. \nNot mindless then, Euryalus, of thee, \nNor of the sacred bonds of amity, \nHe strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross, \nAnd caught the foot of Salius as he rose. \nSo Salius lay extended on the plain; \nEuryalus springs out, the prize to gain, \nAnd leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend \nThe victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend. \nNext Helymus; and then Diores came, \nBy two misfortunes made the third in fame. \nBut Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud \nFor justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd; \nUrges his cause may in the court be heard; \nAnd pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd. \nBut favor for Euryalus appears; \nHis blooming beauty, with his tender tears, \nHad brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize. \nBesides, Diores fills the court with cries, \nWho vainly reaches at the last reward, \nIf the first palm on Salius be conferr'd. \nThen thus the prince: \"Let no disputes arise: \nWhere fortune plac'd it, I award the prize. \nBut fortune's errors give me leave to mend, \nAt least to pity my deserving friend.\" \nHe said, and, from among the spoils, he draws \n(Pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws) \nA lion's hide: to Salius this he gives. \nNisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves. \n\"If such rewards to vanquish'd men are due.\" \nHe said, \"and falling is to rise by you, \nWhat prize may Nisus from your bounty claim, \nWho merited the first rewards and fame? \nIn falling, both an equal fortune tried; \nWould fortune for my fall so well provide!\" \nWith this he pointed to his face, and show'd \nHis hand and all his habit smear'd with blood. \nTh' indulgent father of the people smil'd, \nAnd caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield, \nOf wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought, \nLong since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought. \nThis giv'n to Nisus, he divides the rest, \nAnd equal justice in his gifts express'd. \nThe race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd, \nOnce more the princes bespeaks th' attentive crowd: \n\"If there he here whose dauntless courage dare \nIn gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare, \nHis opposite sustain in open view, \nStand forth the champion, and the games renew. \nTwo prizes I propose, and thus divide: \nA bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied, \nShall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief; \nA sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief.\" \nThen haughty Dares in the lists appears; \nStalking he strides, his head erected bears: \nHis nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield, \nAnd loud applauses echo thro' the field. \nDares alone in combat us'd to stand \nThe match of mighty Paris, hand to hand; \nThe same, at Hector's fun'rals, undertook \nGigantic Butes, of th' Amycian stock, \nAnd, by the stroke of his resistless hand, \nStretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand. \nSuch Dares was; and such he strode along, \nAnd drew the wonder of the gazing throng. \nHis brawny back and ample breast he shows, \nHis lifted arms around his head he throws, \nAnd deals in whistling air his empty blows. \nHis match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band, \nNot one dares answer to the proud demand. \nPresuming of his force, with sparkling eyes \nAlready he devours the promis'd prize. \nHe claims the bull with awless insolence, \nAnd having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince: \n\"If none my matchless valor dares oppose, \nHow long shall Dares wait his dastard foes? \nPermit me, chief, permit without delay, \nTo lead this uncontended gift away.\" \nThe crowd assents, and with redoubled cries \nFor the proud challenger demands the prize. \nAcestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see \nThe palm usurp'd without a victory, \nReproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside, \nAnd heard and saw, unmov'd, the Trojan's pride: \n\"Once, but in vain, a champion of renown, \nSo tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown, \nA prize in triumph borne before your sight, \nAnd shun, for fear, the danger of the fight? \nWhere is our Eryx now, the boasted name, \nThe god who taught your thund'ring arm the game? \nWhere now your baffled honor? Where the spoil \nThat fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our isle?\" \nEntellus, thus: \"My soul is still the same, \nUnmov'd with fear, and mov'd with martial fame; \nBut my chill blood is curdled in my veins, \nAnd scarce the shadow of a man remains. \nO could I turn to that fair prime again, \nThat prime of which this boaster is so vain, \nThe brave, who this decrepid age defies, \nShould feel my force, without the promis'd prize.\" \nHe said; and, rising at the word, he threw \nTwo pond'rous gauntlets down in open view; \nGauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield, \nAnd sheathe his hands with in the listed field. \nWith fear and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds \nThe gloves of death, with sev'n distinguish'd folds \nOf tough bull hides; the space within is spread \nWith iron, or with loads of heavy lead: \nDares himself was daunted at the sight, \nRenounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight. \nAstonish'd at their weight, the hero stands, \nAnd pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands. \n\"What had your wonder,\" said Entellus, \"been, \nHad you the gauntlets of Alcides seen, \nOr view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green! \nThese which I bear your brother Eryx bore, \nStill mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore. \nWith these he long sustain'd th' Herculean arm; \nAnd these I wielded while my blood was warm, \nThis languish'd frame while better spirits fed, \nEre age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head. \nBut if the challenger these arms refuse, \nAnd cannot wield their weight, or dare not use; \nIf great Aeneas and Acestes join \nIn his request, these gauntlets I resign; \nLet us with equal arms perform the fight, \nAnd let him leave to fear, since I resign my right.\" \nThis said, Entellus for the strife prepares; \nStripp'd of his quilted coat, his body bares; \nCompos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands, \nA goodly tow'ring object on the sands. \nThen just Aeneas equal arms supplied, \nWhich round their shoulders to their wrists they tied. \nBoth on the tiptoe stand, at full extent, \nTheir arms aloft, their bodies inly bent; \nTheir heads from aiming blows they bear afar; \nWith clashing gauntlets then provoke the war. \nOne on his youth and pliant limbs relies; \nOne on his sinews and his giant size. \nThe last is stiff with age, his motion slow; \nHe heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro, \nAnd clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow. \nYet equal in success, they ward, they strike; \nTheir ways are diff'rent, but their art alike. \nBefore, behind, the blows are dealt; around \nTheir hollow sides the rattling thumps resound. \nA storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies, \nAnd errs about their temples, ears, and eyes. \nNor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws \nA sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws. \nHeavy with age, Entellus stands his ground, \nBut with his warping body wards the wound. \nHis hand and watchful eye keep even pace; \nWhile Dares traverses and shifts his place, \nAnd, like a captain who beleaguers round \nSome strong-built castle on a rising ground, \nViews all th' approaches with observing eyes: \nThis and that other part in vain he tries, \nAnd more on industry than force relies. \nWith hands on high, Entellus threats the foe; \nBut Dares watch'd the motion from below, \nAnd slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending blow.\n\nEntellus wastes his forces on the wind, \nAnd, thus deluded of the stroke design'd, \nHeadlong and heavy fell; his ample breast \nAnd weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd. \nSo falls a hollow pine, that long had stood \nOn Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood, \nTorn from the roots. The diff'ring nations rise, \nAnd shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies, \nAcestus runs with eager haste, to raise \nThe fall'n companion of his youthful days. \nDauntless he rose, and to the fight return'd; \nWith shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn'd.\n\nDisdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast, \nAnd with redoubled force his foe he press'd. \nHe lays on load with either hand, amain, \nAnd headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain; \nNor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows; \nBut storms of strokes descend about his brows, \nA rattling tempest, and a hail of blows. \nBut now the prince, who saw the wild increase \nOf wounds, commands the combatants to cease, \nAnd bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace. \nFirst to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came, \nAnd sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame. \n\"What fury seiz'd my friend? The gods,\" said he, \n\"To him propitious, and averse to thee, \nHave giv'n his arm superior force to thine. \n'T is madness to contend with strength divine.\" \nThe gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore \nHis faithful friends unhappy Dares bore: \nHis mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood, \nAnd pounded teeth came rushing with his blood. \nFaintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng, \nAnd hung his head, and trail'd his legs along. \nThe sword and casque are carried by his train; \nBut with his foe the palm and ox remain. \nThe champion, then, before Aeneas came, \nProud of his prize, but prouder of his fame: \n\"O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host, \nMark with attention, and forgive my boast; \nLearn what I was, by what remains; and know \nFrom what impending fate you sav'd my foe.\" \nSternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull; \nAnd, on his ample forehead aiming full, \nThe deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull. \nDown drops the beast, nor needs a second wound, \nBut sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground. \nThen, thus: \"In Dares' stead I offer this. \nEryx, accept a nobler sacrifice; \nTake the last gift my wither'd arms can yield: \nThy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field.\" \nThis done, Aeneas orders, for the close, \nThe strife of archers with contending bows. \nThe mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore \nWith his own hands he raises on the shore. \nA flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie, \nThe living mark at which their arrows fly. \nThe rival archers in a line advance, \nTheir turn of shooting to receive from chance. \nA helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn: \nOn the first scroll was read Hippocoon. \nThe people shout. Upon the next was found \nYoung Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd. \nThe third contain'd Eurytion's noble name, \nThy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame, \nWhom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound, \nAnd send among the Greeks a feather'd wound. \nAcestes in the bottom last remain'd, \nWhom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd. \nSoon all with vigor bend their trusty bows, \nAnd from the quiver each his arrow chose. \nHippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway \nIt flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way. \nFix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands: \nThe fearful pigeon flutters in her bands, \nAnd the tree trembled, and the shouting cries \nOf the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies. \nThen Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove, \nWith lifted eyes, and took his aim above, \nBut made a glancing shot, and missed the dove; \nYet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord \nWhich fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird. \nThe captive thus releas'd, away she flies, \nAnd beats with clapping wings the yielding skies. \nHis bow already bent, Eurytion stood; \nAnd, having first invok'd his brother god, \nHis winged shaft with eager haste he sped. \nThe fatal message reach'd her as she fled: \nShe leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground, \nAnd renders back the weapon in the wound. \nAcestes, grudging at his lot, remains, \nWithout a prize to gratify his pains. \nYet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show \nAn archer's art, and boast his twanging bow. \nThe feather'd arrow gave a dire portent, \nAnd latter augurs judge from this event. \nChaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew, \nA trail of following flames ascending drew: \nKindling they mount, and mark the shiny way; \nAcross the skies as falling meteors play, \nAnd vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay. \nThe Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare, \nAnd, trembling, turn their wonder into pray'r. \nThe Dardan prince put on a smiling face, \nAnd strain'd Acestes with a close embrace; \nThen, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest, \nTurn'd the bad omen, nor his fears confess'd. \n\"The gods,\" said he, \"this miracle have wrought, \nAnd order'd you the prize without the lot. \nAccept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold, \nWhich Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old: \nThis pledge of ancient amity receive, \nWhich to my second sire I justly give.\" \nHe said, and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound, \nProclaim'd him victor, and with laurel-crown'd. \nNor good Eurytion envied him the prize, \nTho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies. \nWho cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd; \nThe third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast. \nThe chief, before the games were wholly done, \nCall'd Periphantes, tutor to his son, \nAnd whisper'd thus: \"With speed Ascanius find; \nAnd, if his childish troop be ready join'd, \nOn horseback let him grace his grandsire's day, \nAnd lead his equals arm'd in just array.\" \nHe said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears. \nThe crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears. \nAnd now the noble youths, of form divine, \nAdvance before their fathers, in a line; \nThe riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine.\n\nThus marching on in military pride, \nShouts of applause resound from side to side. \nTheir casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear, \nEach brandishing aloft a cornel spear. \nSome at their backs their gilded quivers bore; \nTheir chains of burnish'd gold hung down before. \nThree graceful troops they form'd upon the green; \nThree graceful leaders at their head were seen; \nTwelve follow'd ev'ry chief, and left a space between. \nThe first young Priam led; a lovely boy, \nWhose grandsire was th' unhappy king of Troy; \nHis race in after times was known to fame, \nNew honors adding to the Latian name; \nAnd well the royal boy his Thracian steed became. \nWhite were the fetlocks of his feet before, \nAnd on his front a snowy star he bore. \nThen beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred, \nOf equal age, the second squadron led. \nThe last in order, but the first in place, \nFirst in the lovely features of his face, \nRode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed, \nQueen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed. \nSure coursers for the rest the king ordains, \nWith golden bits adorn'd, and purple reins. \nThe pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew, \nAnd all the parents in the children view; \nTheir make, their motions, and their sprightly grace, \nAnd hopes and fears alternate in their face. \nTh' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train \nFirst make the circuit of the sandy plain \nAround their sires, and, at th' appointed sign, \nDrawn up in beauteous order, form a line. \nThe second signal sounds, the troop divides \nIn three distinguish'd parts, with three distinguish'd guides\n\nAgain they close, and once again disjoin; \nIn troop to troop oppos'd, and line to line. \nThey meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar \nWith harmless rage and well-dissembled war. \nThen in a round the mingled bodies run: \nFlying they follow, and pursuing shun; \nBroken, they break; and, rallying, they renew \nIn other forms the military shew. \nAt last, in order, undiscern'd they join, \nAnd march together in a friendly line. \nAnd, as the Cretan labyrinth of old, \nWith wand'ring ways and many a winding fold, \nInvolv'd the weary feet, without redress, \nIn a round error, which denied recess; \nSo fought the Trojan boys in warlike play, \nTurn'd and return'd, and still a diff'rent way. \nThus dolphins in the deep each other chase \nIn circles, when they swim around the wat'ry race. \nThis game, these carousels, Ascanius taught; \nAnd, building Alba, to the Latins brought; \nShew'd what he learn'd: the Latin sires impart \nTo their succeeding sons the graceful art; \nFrom these imperial Rome receiv'd the game, \nWhich Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name. \nThus far the sacred sports they celebrate: \nBut Fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate; \nFor, while they pay the dead his annual dues, \nThose envied rites Saturnian Juno views; \nAnd sends the goddess of the various bow, \nTo try new methods of revenge below; \nSupplies the winds to wing her airy way, \nWhere in the port secure the navy lay. \nSwiftly fair Iris down her arch descends, \nAnd, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends. \nShe saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence, \nThe desart shore, and fleet without defense. \nThe Trojan matrons, on the sands alone, \nWith sighs and tears Anchises' death bemoan; \nThen, turning to the sea their weeping eyes, \nTheir pity to themselves renews their cries. \n\"Alas!\" said one, \"what oceans yet remain \nFor us to sail! what labors to sustain!\" \nAll take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan, \nImplore the gods for peace, and places of their own. \nThe goddess, great in mischief, views their pains, \nAnd in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs restrains. \nIn face and shape old Beroe she became, \nDoryclus' wife, a venerable dame, \nOnce blest with riches, and a mother's name. \nThus chang'd, amidst the crying crowd she ran, \nMix'd with the matrons, and these words began: \n\"O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow'r, \nNor flames, destroy'd, in Troy's unhappy hour! \nO wretched we, reserv'd by cruel fate, \nBeyond the ruins of the sinking state! \nNow sev'n revolving years are wholly run, \nSince this improsp'rous voyage we begun; \nSince, toss'd from shores to shores, from lands to lands,\n\nInhospitable rocks and barren sands, \nWand'ring in exile thro' the stormy sea, \nWe search in vain for flying Italy. \nNow cast by fortune on this kindred land, \nWhat should our rest and rising walls withstand, \nOr hinder here to fix our banish'd band? \nO country lost, and gods redeem'd in vain, \nIf still in endless exile we remain! \nShall we no more the Trojan walls renew, \nOr streams of some dissembled Simois view! \nHaste, join with me, th' unhappy fleet consume! \nCassandra bids; and I declare her doom. \nIn sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands \n(For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands: \n'With these,' said she, 'these wand'ring ships destroy: \nThese are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.' \nTime calls you now; the precious hour employ: \nSlack not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires \nOur minds to dare, and gives the ready fires. \nSee! Neptune's altars minister their brands: \nThe god is pleas'd; the god supplies our hands.\" \nThen from the pile a flaming fire she drew, \nAnd, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw. \nWrapp'd in amaze, the matrons wildly stare: \nThen Pyrgo, reverenc'd for her hoary hair, \nPyrgo, the nurse of Priam's num'rous race: \n\"No Beroe this, tho' she belies her face! \nWhat terrors from her frowning front arise! \nBehold a goddess in her ardent eyes! \nWhat rays around her heav'nly face are seen! \nMark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien! \nBeroe but now I left, whom, pin'd with pain, \nHer age and anguish from these rites detain,\" \nShe said. The matrons, seiz'd with new amaze, \nRoll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze. \nThey fear, and hope, and neither part obey: \nThey hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way. \nThe goddess, having done her task below, \nMounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow. \nStruck with the sight, and seiz'd with rage divine, \nThe matrons prosecute their mad design: \nThey shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands, \nThe food of altars; fires and flaming brands. \nGreen boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste, \nAnd smoking torches, on the ships they cast. \nThe flame, unstopp'd at first, more fury gains, \nAnd Vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins: \nTriumphant to the painted sterns he soars, \nAnd seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars. \nEumelus was the first the news to bear, \nWhile yet they crowd the rural theater. \nThen, what they hear, is witness'd by their eyes: \nA storm of sparkles and of flames arise. \nAscanius took th' alarm, while yet he led \nHis early warriors on his prancing steed, \nAnd, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd; \nNor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste. \nSoon as the royal youth appear'd in view, \nHe sent his voice before him as he flew: \n\"What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy \nThe last remainders of unhappy Troy! \nNot hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn, \nAnd on your friends your fatal fury turn. \nBehold your own Ascanius!\" While he said, \nHe drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head, \nIn which the youths to sportful arms he led. \nBy this, Aeneas and his train appear; \nAnd now the women, seiz'd with shame and fear, \nDispers'd, to woods and caverns take their flight, \nAbhor their actions, and avoid the light; \nTheir friends acknowledge, and their error find, \nAnd shake the goddess from their alter'd mind. \nNot so the raging fires their fury cease, \nBut, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace, \nWork on their way amid the smold'ring tow, \nSure in destruction, but in motion slow. \nThe silent plague thro' the green timber eats, \nAnd vomits out a tardy flame by fits. \nDown to the keels, and upward to the sails, \nThe fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; \nNor buckets pour'd, nor strength of human hand, \nCan the victorious element withstand. \nThe pious hero rends his robe, and throws \nTo heav'n his hands, and with his hands his vows. \n\"O Jove,\" he cried, \"if pray'rs can yet have place; \nIf thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race; \nIf any spark of pity still remain; \nIf gods are gods, and not invok'd in vain; \nYet spare the relics of the Trojan train! \nYet from the flames our burning vessels free, \nOr let thy fury fall alone on me! \nAt this devoted head thy thunder throw, \nAnd send the willing sacrifice below!\" \nScarce had he said, when southern storms arise: \nFrom pole to pole the forky lightning flies; \nLoud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain; \nHeav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain. \nWhole sheets of water from the clouds are sent, \nWhich, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent, \nAnd stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone \nBurn to the waist, and for the fleet atone. \nBut doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide; \nIf he should still in Sicily reside, \nForgetful of his fates, or tempt the main, \nIn hope the promis'd Italy to gain. \nThen Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone \nThe will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown; \nVers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd \nTo tell events, and what the fates requir'd; \nThus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd, \nWith cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind: \n\"O goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry state, \nWith patience bear, with prudence push your fate. \nBy suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue; \nFly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue. \nYour friend Acestes is of Trojan kind; \nTo him disclose the secrets of your mind: \nTrust in his hands your old and useless train; \nToo num'rous for the ships which yet remain: \nThe feeble, old, indulgent of their ease, \nThe dames who dread the dangers of the seas, \nWith all the dastard crew, who dare not stand \nThe shock of battle with your foes by land. \nHere you may build a common town for all, \nAnd, from Acestes' name, Acesta call.\" \nThe reasons, with his friend's experience join'd, \nEncourag'd much, but more disturb'd his mind. \n'T was dead of night; when to his slumb'ring eyes \nHis father's shade descended from the skies, \nAnd thus he spoke: \"O more than vital breath, \nLov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after death; \nO son, in various toils and troubles toss'd, \nThe King of Heav'n employs my careful ghost \nOn his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire \nYour flaming fleet, and heard your just desire. \nThe wholesome counsel of your friend receive, \nAnd here the coward train and woman leave: \nThe chosen youth, and those who nobly dare, \nTransport, to tempt the dangers of the war. \nThe stern Italians will their courage try; \nRough are their manners, and their minds are high. \nBut first to Pluto's palace you shall go, \nAnd seek my shade among the blest below: \nFor not with impious ghosts my soul remains, \nNor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains, \nBut breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains. \nThe chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey, \nAnd blood of offer'd victims free the way. \nThere shall you know what realms the gods assign, \nAnd learn the fates and fortunes of your line. \nBut now, farewell! I vanish with the night, \nAnd feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light.\" \nHe said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy flight.\n\n\"Whither so fast?\" the filial duty cried; \n\"And why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?\" \nHe said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires, \nHe rakes hot embers, and renews the fires; \nHis country gods and Vesta then adores \nWith cakes and incense, and their aid implores. \nNext, for his friends and royal host he sent, \nReveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent, \nWith his own purpose. All, without delay, \nThe will of Jove, and his desires obey. \nThey list with women each degenerate name, \nWho dares not hazard life for future fame. \nThese they cashier: the brave remaining few, \nOars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew. \nThe prince designs a city with the plow; \nThe lots their sev'ral tenements allow. \nThis part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy, \nAnd the new king ascends the throne with joy; \nA chosen senate from the people draws; \nAppoints the judges, and ordains the laws. \nThen, on the top of Eryx, they begin \nA rising temple to the Paphian queen. \nAnchises, last, is honor'd as a god; \nA priest is added, annual gifts bestow'd, \nAnd groves are planted round his blest abode. \nNine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd; \nAnd fumes of incense in the fanes abound. \nThen from the south arose a gentle breeze \nThat curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas; \nThe rising winds a ruffling gale afford, \nAnd call the merry mariners aboard. \nNow loud laments along the shores resound, \nOf parting friends in close embraces bound. \nThe trembling women, the degenerate train, \nWho shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main, \nEv'n those desire to sail, and take their share \nOf the rough passage and the promis'd war: \nWhom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends \nTo their new master's care his fearful friends. \nOn Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays; \nA lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas; \nThen slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs. \nHigh on the deck the godlike hero stands, \nWith olive crown'd, a charger in his hands; \nThen cast the reeking entrails in the brine, \nAnd pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine. \nFresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie, \nAnd brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly. \nMeantime the mother goddess, full of fears, \nTo Neptune thus address'd, with tender tears: \n\"The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage, \nThe malice which no suff'rings can assuage, \nCompel me to these pray'rs; since neither fate, \nNor time, nor pity, can remove her hate: \nEv'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife; \nStill vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife. \nAs if 't were little to consume the town \nWhich aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown, \nShe prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains, \nAnd gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains. \nLet her the causes of her hatred tell; \nBut you can witness its effects too well. \nYou saw the storm she rais'd on Libyan floods, \nThat mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds; \nWhen, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main, \nAnd mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign. \nWith fury she possess'd the Dardan dames, \nTo burn their fleet with execrable flames, \nAnd forc'd Aeneas, when his ships were lost, \nTo leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast. \nFor what remains, your godhead I implore, \nAnd trust my son to your protecting pow'r. \nIf neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand, \nSecure his passage to the Latian land.\" \nThen thus the mighty Ruler of the Main: \n\"What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign? \nMy kingdom claims your birth; my late defense \nOf your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence. \nNor less by land than sea my deeds declare \nHow much your lov'd Aeneas is my care. \nThee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest. \nYour Trojan troops when proud Achilles press'd, \nAnd drove before him headlong on the plain, \nAnd dash'd against the walls the trembling train; \nWhen floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain; \nWhen crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way, \nStood up on ridges to behold the sea; \n(New heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd his way;) \nWhen your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds \nOf force unequal, and unequal gods; \nI spread a cloud before the victor's sight, \nSustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight; \nEv'n then secur'd him, when I sought with joy \nThe vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy. \nMy will's the same: fair goddess, fear no more, \nYour fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore; \nTheir lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone \nShall perish, and for multitudes atone.\" \nThus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind, \nHis finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd, \nThen adds the foamy bridle to their jaws, \nAnd to the loosen'd reins permits the laws. \nHigh on the waves his azure car he guides; \nIts axles thunder, and the sea subsides, \nAnd the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides. \nThe tempests fly before their father's face, \nTrains of inferior gods his triumph grace, \nAnd monster whales before their master play, \nAnd choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way. \nThe marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide \nTo right and left; the gods his better side \nInclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride. \nNow smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude, \nWithin the hero's mind his joys renew'd. \nHe calls to raise the masts, the sheets display; \nThe cheerful crew with diligence obey; \nThey scud before the wind, and sail in open sea. \nAhead of all the master pilot steers; \nAnd, as he leads, the following navy veers. \nThe steeds of Night had travel'd half the sky, \nThe drowsy rowers on their benches lie, \nWhen the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight, \nDescends, and draws behind a trail of light. \nThou, Palinurus, art his destin'd prey; \nTo thee alone he takes his fatal way. \nDire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears; \nAnd, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears. \nThen thus the traitor god began his tale: \n\"The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale; \nThe ships, without thy care, securely sail. \nNow steal an hour of sweet repose; and I \nWill take the rudder and thy room supply.\" \nTo whom the yawning pilot, half asleep: \n\"Me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep, \nThe harlot smiles of her dissembling face, \nAnd to her faith commit the Trojan race? \nShall I believe the Siren South again, \nAnd, oft betray'd, not know the monster main?\" \nHe said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep, \nAnd, fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep. \nThe god was wroth, and at his temples threw \nA branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with Stygian dew: \nThe pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine, \nSoon clos'd his swimming eyes, and lay supine. \nScarce were his limbs extended at their length, \nThe god, insulting with superior strength, \nFell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea, \nAnd, with the stern, the rudder tore away. \nHeadlong he fell, and, struggling in the main, \nCried out for helping hands, but cried in vain. \nThe victor daemon mounts obscure in air, \nWhile the ship sails without the pilot's care. \nOn Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies; \nBut what the man forsook, the god supplies, \nAnd o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies; \nGlides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast, \nLong infamous for ships and sailors lost, \nAnd white with bones. Th' impetuous ocean roars, \nAnd rocks rebellow from the sounding shores. \nThe watchful hero felt the knocks, and found \nThe tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground. \nSure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself \nThe helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf. \nInly he griev'd, and, groaning from the breast, \nDeplor'd his death; and thus his pain express'd: \n\"For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring sky, \nThy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie.\" \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VI\n\nHe said, and wept; then spread his sails before \nThe winds, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore: \nTheir anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor. \nThey turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land, \nAnd greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand. \nSome strike from clashing flints their fiery seed; \nSome gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed, \nOr search for hollow trees, and fell the woods, \nOr trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods. \nThus, while their sev'ral charges they fulfil, \nThe pious prince ascends the sacred hill \nWhere Phoebus is ador'd; and seeks the shade \nWhich hides from sight his venerable maid. \nDeep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode; \nThence full of fate returns, and of the god. \nThro' Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold, \nAnd enter now, the temple roof'd with gold. \nWhen Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore, \nHis heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore, \n(The first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by Fame, \nTo the Cumaean coast at length he came, \nAnd here alighting, built this costly frame. \nInscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high \nThe steerage of his wings, that cut the sky: \nThen o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd \nAndrogeos' death, and off'rings to his ghost; \nSev'n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet \nThe fate appointed by revengeful Crete. \nAnd next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd, \nIn which the destin'd names by lots were cast: \nThe mournful parents stand around in tears, \nAnd rising Crete against their shore appears. \nThere too, in living sculpture, might be seen \nThe mad affection of the Cretan queen; \nThen how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye; \nThe rushing leap, the doubtful progeny, \nThe lower part a beast, a man above, \nThe monument of their polluted love. \nNot far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze, \nA thousand doors, a thousand winding ways: \nHere dwells the monster, hid from human view, \nNot to be found, but by the faithful clew; \nTill the kind artist, mov'd with pious grief, \nLent to the loving maid this last relief, \nAnd all those erring paths describ'd so well \nThat Theseus conquer'd and the monster fell. \nHere hapless Icarus had found his part, \nHad not the father's grief restrain'd his art. \nHe twice assay'd to cast his son in gold; \nTwice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold. \nAll this with wond'ring eyes Aeneas view'd; \nEach varying object his delight renew'd: \nEager to read the rest- Achates came, \nAnd by his side the mad divining dame, \nThe priestess of the god, Deiphobe her name. \n\"Time suffers not,\" she said, \"to feed your eyes \nWith empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice. \nSev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd, for Phoebus choose, \nAnd for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes.\" \nThis said, the servants urge the sacred rites, \nWhile to the temple she the prince invites. \nA spacious cave, within its farmost part, \nWas hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art \nThro' the hill's hollow sides: before the place, \nA hundred doors a hundred entries grace; \nAs many voices issue, and the sound \nOf Sybil's words as many times rebound. \nNow to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries: \n\"This is the time; enquire your destinies. \nHe comes; behold the god!\" Thus while she said, \n(And shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd,) \nHer color chang'd; her face was not the same, \nAnd hollow groans from her deep spirit came. \nHer hair stood up; convulsive rage possess'd \nHer trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast. \nGreater than humankind she seem'd to look, \nAnd with an accent more than mortal spoke. \nHer staring eyes with sparkling fury roll; \nWhen all the god came rushing on her soul. \nSwiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke: \n\"Why this delay?\" she cried- \"the pow'rs invoke! \nThy pray'rs alone can open this abode; \nElse vain are my demands, and dumb the god.\" \nShe said no more. The trembling Trojans hear, \nO'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear. \nThe prince himself, with awful dread possess'd, \nHis vows to great Apollo thus address'd: \n\"Indulgent god, propitious pow'r to Troy, \nSwift to relieve, unwilling to destroy, \nDirected by whose hand the Dardan dart \nPierc'd the proud Grecian's only mortal part: \nThus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands, \nThro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands, \nOur exil'd crew has sought th' Ausonian ground; \nAnd now, at length, the flying coast is found. \nThus far the fate of Troy, from place to place, \nWith fury has pursued her wand'ring race. \nHere cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end: \nTroy is no more, and can no more offend. \nAnd thou, O sacred maid, inspir'd to see \nTh' event of things in dark futurity; \nGive me what Heav'n has promis'd to my fate, \nTo conquer and command the Latian state; \nTo fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place \nFor the long exiles of the Trojan race. \nThen shall my grateful hands a temple rear \nTo the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r; \nAnd annual rites, and festivals, and games, \nShall be perform'd to their auspicious names. \nNor shalt thou want thy honors in my land; \nFor there thy faithful oracles shall stand, \nPreserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay, \nWhich, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey: \nAll shall be treasur'd by a chosen train \nOf holy priests, and ever shall remain. \nBut O! commit not thy prophetic mind \nTo flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind, \nLest they disperse in air our empty fate; \nWrite not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate.\" \nStruggling in vain, impatient of her load, \nAnd lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god, \nThe more she strove to shake him from her breast, \nWith more and far superior force he press'd; \nCommands his entrance, and, without control, \nUsurps her organs and inspires her soul. \nNow, with a furious blast, the hundred doors \nOpe of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars \nWithin the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores: \n\"Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign, \nYet more and greater ills by land remain. \nThe coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event), \nThy troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent. \nWars, horrid wars, I view- a field of blood, \nAnd Tiber rolling with a purple flood. \nSimois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there: \nA new Achilles shall in arms appear, \nAnd he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate, \nAdded to hostile force, shall urge thy fate. \nTo what strange nations shalt not thou resort, \nDriv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court! \nThe cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd; \nA foreign mistress, and a foreign guest. \nBut thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes, \nThe more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose. \nThe dawnings of thy safety shall be shown \nFrom whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town.\" \nThus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke, \nAnd the resisting air the thunder broke; \nThe cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook. \nTh' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast, \nIn these mysterious words his mind express'd; \nSome truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest. \nAt length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd, \nAnd, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd. \nThen thus the chief: \"No terror to my view, \nNo frightful face of danger can be new. \nInur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare, \nThe Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without my care. \nThis let me crave, since near your grove the road \nTo hell lies open, and the dark abode \nWhich Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood; \nConduct me thro' the regions void of light, \nAnd lead me longing to my father's sight. \nFor him, a thousand dangers I have sought, \nAnd, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought, \nSafe on my back the sacred burthen brought. \nHe, for my sake, the raging ocean tried, \nAnd wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide, \nAnd bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied. \nOft, since he breath'd his last, in dead of night \nHis reverend image stood before my sight; \nEnjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade; \nConducted there by your unerring aid. \nBut you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won, \nOblige the father, and protect the son. \nYours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain \nHas made you priestess of her nightly reign. \nIf Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre, \nThe ruthless king with pity could inspire, \nAnd from the shades below redeem his wife; \nIf Pollux, off'ring his alternate life, \nCould free his brother, and can daily go \nBy turns aloft, by turns descend below- \nWhy name I Theseus, or his greater friend, \nWho trod the downward path, and upward could ascend? \nNot less than theirs from Jove my lineage came; \nMy mother greater, my descent the same.\" \nSo pray'd the Trojan prince, and, while he pray'd, \nHis hand upon the holy altar laid. \nThen thus replied the prophetess divine: \n\"O goddess-born of great Anchises' line, \nThe gates of hell are open night and day; \nSmooth the descent, and easy is the way: \nBut to return, and view the cheerful skies, \nIn this the task and mighty labor lies. \nTo few great Jupiter imparts this grace, \nAnd those of shining worth and heav'nly race. \nBetwixt those regions and our upper light, \nDeep forests and impenetrable night \nPossess the middle space: th' infernal bounds \nCocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds. \nBut if so dire a love your soul invades, \nAs twice below to view the trembling shades; \nIf you so hard a toil will undertake, \nAs twice to pass th' innavigable lake; \nReceive my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove \nThere stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove \nClaims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night \nConceal the happy plant from human sight. \nOne bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!) \nThe ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold: \nThis from the vulgar branches must be torn, \nAnd to fair Proserpine the present borne, \nEre leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies. \nThe first thus rent a second will arise, \nAnd the same metal the same room supplies. \nLook round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see \nThe lurking gold upon the fatal tree: \nThen rend it off, as holy rites command; \nThe willing metal will obey thy hand, \nFollowing with ease, if favor'd by thy fate, \nThou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state: \nIf not, no labor can the tree constrain; \nAnd strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain. \nBesides, you know not, while you here attend, \nTh' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend: \nBreathless he lies; and his unburied ghost, \nDepriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host. \nPay first his pious dues; and, for the dead, \nTwo sable sheep around his hearse be led; \nThen, living turfs upon his body lay: \nThis done, securely take the destin'd way, \nTo find the regions destitute of day.\" \nShe said, and held her peace. Aeneas went \nSad from the cave, and full of discontent, \nUnknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. \nAchates, the companion of his breast, \nGoes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress'd. \nWalking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd \nWhat friend the priestess by those words design'd. \nBut soon they found an object to deplore: \nMisenus lay extended the shore; \nSon of the God of Winds: none so renown'd \nThe warrior trumpet in the field to sound; \nWith breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms, \nAnd rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms. \nHe serv'd great Hector, and was ever near, \nNot with his trumpet only, but his spear. \nBut by Pelides' arms when Hector fell, \nHe chose Aeneas; and he chose as well. \nSwoln with applause, and aiming still at more, \nHe now provokes the sea gods from the shore; \nWith envy Triton heard the martial sound, \nAnd the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd; \nThen cast his mangled carcass on the strand: \nThe gazing crowd around the body stand. \nAll weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate, \nAnd hastens to perform the funeral state. \nIn altar-wise, a stately pile they rear; \nThe basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air. \nAn ancient wood, fit for the work design'd, \n(The shady covert of the salvage kind,) \nThe Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied; \nFirs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring pride \nOf forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke, \nAnd piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak. \nHuge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy crown \nOf the bare mountains, roll with ruin down. \nArm'd like the rest the Trojan prince appears, \nAnd by his pious labor urges theirs. \nThus while he wrought, revolving in his mind \nThe ways to compass what his wish design'd, \nHe cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove, \nAnd then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love: \n\"O may thy pow'r, propitious still to me, \nConduct my steps to find the fatal tree, \nIn this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath \nForetold, alas! too true, Misenus' death.\" \nScarce had he said, when, full before his sight, \nTwo doves, descending from their airy flight, \nSecure upon the grassy plain alight. \nHe knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd: \n\"Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid, \nAnd lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, \nWhose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground. \nAnd thou, great parent, with celestial care, \nIn this distress be present to my pray'r!\" \nThus having said, he stopp'd with watchful sight, \nObserving still the motions of their flight, \nWhat course they took, what happy signs they shew. \nThey fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees withdrew \nStill farther from the place, but still in view: \nHopping and flying, thus they led him on \nTo the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun \nThey wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low, \nPerch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough. \nThro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow; \nAs, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe, \nWhere the proud mother views her precious brood, \nAnd happier branches, which she never sow'd. \nSuch was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind, \nAnd dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind. \nHe seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold, \nAnd rent away, with ease, the ling'ring gold; \nThen to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize. \nMeantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes, \nTo dead Misenus pay his obsequies. \nFirst, from the ground a lofty pile they rear, \nOf pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir: \nThe fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew, \nAnd stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew. \nThe topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn; \nWarm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne, \nAre pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint, \nAnd fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint. \nWith groans and cries Misenus they deplore: \nThen on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er, \nThe breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay, \nAnd fire the pile, their faces turn'd away- \nSuch reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay. \nPure oil and incense on the fire they throw, \nAnd fat of victims, which his friends bestow. \nThese gifts the greedy flames to dust devour; \nThen on the living coals red wine they pour; \nAnd, last, the relics by themselves dispose, \nWhich in a brazen urn the priests inclose. \nOld Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew, \nAnd dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew; \nWhich thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud \nInvok'd the dead, and then dismissed the crowd. \nBut good Aeneas order'd on the shore \nA stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore, \nA soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar. \nThus was his friend interr'd; and deathless fame \nStill to the lofty cape consigns his name. \nThese rites perform'd, the prince, without delay, \nHastes to the nether world his destin'd way. \nDeep was the cave; and, downward as it went \nFrom the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent; \nAnd here th' access a gloomy grove defends, \nAnd there th' unnavigable lake extends, \nO'er whose unhappy waters, void of light, \nNo bird presumes to steer his airy flight; \nSuch deadly stenches from the depths arise, \nAnd steaming sulphur, that infects the skies. \nFrom hence the Grecian bards their legends make, \nAnd give the name Avernus to the lake. \nFour sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught, \nFor sacrifice the pious hero brought. \nThe priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns; \nThen cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns, \nInvoking Hecate hither to repair: \nA pow'rful name in hell and upper air. \nThe sacred priests with ready knives bereave \nThe beasts of life, and in full bowls receive \nThe streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night \n(The sable wool without a streak of white) \nAeneas offers; and, by fate's decree, \nA barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee, \nWith holocausts he Pluto's altar fills; \nSev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills; \nThen on the broiling entrails oil he pours; \nWhich, ointed thus, the raging flame devours. \nLate the nocturnal sacrifice begun, \nNor ended till the next returning sun. \nThen earth began to bellow, trees to dance, \nAnd howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance, \nEre Hecate came. \"Far hence be souls profane!\" \nThe Sibyl cried, \"and from the grove abstain! \nNow, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford; \nAssume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword.\" \nShe said, and pass'd along the gloomy space; \nThe prince pursued her steps with equal pace. \nYe realms, yet unreveal'd to human sight, \nYe gods who rule the regions of the night, \nYe gliding ghosts, permit me to relate \nThe mystic wonders of your silent state! \nObscure they went thro' dreary shades, that led \nAlong the waste dominions of the dead. \nThus wander travelers in woods by night, \nBy the moon's doubtful and malignant light, \nWhen Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies, \nAnd the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes.\n\nJust in the gate and in the jaws of hell, \nRevengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell, \nAnd pale Diseases, and repining Age, \nWant, Fear, and Famine's unresisted rage; \nHere Toils, and Death, and Death's half-brother, Sleep, \nForms terrible to view, their sentry keep; \nWith anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind, \nDeep Frauds before, and open Force behind; \nThe Furies' iron beds; and Strife, that shakes \nHer hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes. \nFull in the midst of this infernal road, \nAn elm displays her dusky arms abroad: \nThe God of Sleep there hides his heavy head, \nAnd empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread. \nOf various forms unnumber'd specters more, \nCentaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door. \nBefore the passage, horrid Hydra stands, \nAnd Briareus with all his hundred hands; \nGorgons, Geryon with his triple frame; \nAnd vain Chimaera vomits empty flame. \nThe chief unsheath'd his shining steel, prepar'd, \nTho' seiz'd with sudden fear, to force the guard, \nOff'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face; \nHad not the Sibyl stopp'd his eager pace, \nAnd told him what those empty phantoms were: \nForms without bodies, and impassive air. \nHence to deep Acheron they take their way, \nWhose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay, \nAre whirl'd aloft, and in Cocytus lost. \nThere Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast- \nA sordid god: down from his hoary chin \nA length of beard descends, uncomb'd, unclean; \nHis eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire; \nA girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire. \nHe spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers; \nThe freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears.\n\nHe look'd in years; yet in his years were seen \nA youthful vigor and autumnal green. \nAn airy crowd came rushing where he stood, \nWhich fill'd the margin of the fatal flood: \nHusbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids, \nAnd mighty heroes' more majestic shades, \nAnd youths, intomb'd before their fathers' eyes, \nWith hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries. \nThick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods, \nOr fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the floods, \nAnd wing their hasty flight to happier lands; \nSuch, and so thick, the shiv'ring army stands, \nAnd press for passage with extended hands. \nNow these, now those, the surly boatman bore: \nThe rest he drove to distance from the shore. \nThe hero, who beheld with wond'ring eyes \nThe tumult mix'd with shrieks, laments, and cries, \nAsk'd of his guide, what the rude concourse meant; \nWhy to the shore the thronging people bent; \nWhat forms of law among the ghosts were us'd; \nWhy some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd. \n\"Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods,\" \nThe Sibyl said, \"you see the Stygian floods, \nThe sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state \nAttests in oaths, and fears to violate. \nThe ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew \nDepriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due: \nThe boatman, Charon; those, the buried host, \nHe ferries over to the farther coast; \nNor dares his transport vessel cross the waves \nWith such whose bones are not compos'd in graves. \nA hundred years they wander on the shore; \nAt length, their penance done, are wafted o'er.\" \nThe Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd, \nRevolving anxious thoughts within his breast, \nHe saw his friends, who, whelm'd beneath the waves, \nTheir fun'ral honors claim'd, and ask'd their quiet graves.\n\nThe lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew, \nAnd the brave leader of the Lycian crew, \nWhom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met; \nThe sailors master'd, and the ship o'erset. \nAmidst the spirits, Palinurus press'd, \nYet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest, \nWho, while he steering view'd the stars, and bore \nHis course from Afric to the Latian shore, \nFell headlong down. The Trojan fix'd his view, \nAnd scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew. \nThen thus the prince: \"What envious pow'r, O friend, \nBrought your lov'd life to this disastrous end? \nFor Phoebus, ever true in all he said, \nHas in your fate alone my faith betray'd. \nThe god foretold you should not die, before \nYou reach'd, secure from seas, th' Italian shore. \nIs this th' unerring pow'r?\" The ghost replied; \n\"Nor Phoebus flatter'd, nor his answers lied; \nNor envious gods have sent me to the deep: \nBut, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep, \nMy wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep. \nI fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd \nWas drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd. \nNow by the winds and raging waves I swear, \nYour safety, more than mine, was then my care; \nLest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost, \nYour ship should run against the rocky coast. \nThree blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast, \nI floated, and discover'd land at last: \nHigh on a mounting wave my head I bore, \nForcing my strength, and gath'ring to the shore. \nPanting, but past the danger, now I seiz'd \nThe craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd. \nWhile, cumber'd with my dropping clothes, I lay, \nThe cruel nation, covetous of prey, \nStain'd with my blood th' unhospitable coast; \nAnd now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss'd:\n\nWhich O avert, by yon ethereal light, \nWhich I have lost for this eternal night! \nOr, if by dearer ties you may be won, \nBy your dead sire, and by your living son, \nRedeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost; \nOr with your navy seek the Velin coast, \nAnd in a peaceful grave my corpse compose; \nOr, if a nearer way your mother shows, \nWithout whose aid you durst not undertake \nThis frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake, \nLend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er \nTo the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore.\" \nScarce had he said, the prophetess began: \n\"What hopes delude thee, miserable man? \nThink'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods, \nTo view the Furies and infernal gods, \nAnd visit, without leave, the dark abodes? \nAttend the term of long revolving years; \nFate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears. \nThis comfort of thy dire misfortune take: \nThe wrath of Heav'n, inflicted for thy sake, \nWith vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast, \nTill they propitiate thy offended ghost, \nAnd raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r; \nAnd Palinurus' name the place shall bear.\" \nThis calm'd his cares; sooth'd with his future fame, \nAnd pleas'd to hear his propagated name. \nNow nearer to the Stygian lake they draw: \nWhom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw; \nObserv'd their passage thro' the shady wood, \nAnd mark'd their near approaches to the flood. \nThen thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath: \n\"Mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path \nIn arms presum'st to tread, I charge thee, stand, \nAnd tell thy name, and bus'ness in the land. \nKnow this, the realm of night- the Stygian shore: \nMy boat conveys no living bodies o'er; \nNor was I pleas'd great Theseus once to bear, \nWho forc'd a passage with his pointed spear, \nNor strong Alcides- men of mighty fame, \nAnd from th' immortal gods their lineage came. \nIn fetters one the barking porter tied, \nAnd took him trembling from his sov'reign's side: \nTwo sought by force to seize his beauteous bride.\" \nTo whom the Sibyl thus: \"Compose thy mind; \nNor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force design'd. \nStill may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain \nOf airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train, \nAnd with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain. \nThe Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove, \nMuch fam'd for arms, and more for filial love, \nIs sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove. \nIf neither piety, nor Heav'n's command, \nCan gain his passage to the Stygian strand, \nThis fatal present shall prevail at least.\" \nThen shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within her vest.\n\nNo more was needful: for the gloomy god \nStood mute with awe, to see the golden rod; \nAdmir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen- \nA venerable gift, so rarely seen. \nHis fury thus appeas'd, he puts to land; \nThe ghosts forsake their seats at his command: \nHe clears the deck, receives the mighty freight; \nThe leaky vessel groans beneath the weight. \nSlowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides; \nThe pressing water pours within her sides. \nHis passengers at length are wafted o'er, \nExpos'd, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore. \nNo sooner landed, in his den they found \nThe triple porter of the Stygian sound, \nGrim Cerberus, who soon began to rear \nHis crested snakes, and arm'd his bristling hair. \nThe prudent Sibyl had before prepar'd \nA sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard; \nWhich, mix'd with pow'rful drugs, she cast before \nHis greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar. \nWith three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight, \nWith hunger press'd, devours the pleasing bait. \nLong draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave; \nHe reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave. \nThe keeper charm'd, the chief without delay \nPass'd on, and took th' irremeable way. \nBefore the gates, the cries of babes new born, \nWhom fate had from their tender mothers torn, \nAssault his ears: then those, whom form of laws \nCondemn'd to die, when traitors judg'd their cause. \nNor want they lots, nor judges to review \nThe wrongful sentence, and award a new. \nMinos, the strict inquisitor, appears; \nAnd lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears. \nRound in his urn the blended balls he rolls, \nAbsolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls. \nThe next, in place and punishment, are they \nWho prodigally throw their souls away; \nFools, who, repining at their wretched state, \nAnd loathing anxious life, suborn'd their fate. \nWith late repentance now they would retrieve \nThe bodies they forsook, and wish to live; \nTheir pains and poverty desire to bear, \nTo view the light of heav'n, and breathe the vital air: \nBut fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose, \nAnd with circling streams the captive souls inclose. \nNot far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear \nSo call'd from lovers that inhabit there. \nThe souls whom that unhappy flame invades, \nIn secret solitude and myrtle shades \nMake endless moans, and, pining with desire, \nLament too late their unextinguish'd fire. \nHere Procris, Eriphyle here he found, \nBaring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound \nMade by her son. He saw Pasiphae there, \nWith Phaedra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair. \nThere Laodamia, with Evadne, moves, \nUnhappy both, but loyal in their loves: \nCaeneus, a woman once, and once a man, \nBut ending in the sex she first began. \nNot far from these Phoenician Dido stood, \nFresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood; \nWhom when the Trojan hero hardly knew, \nObscure in shades, and with a doubtful view, \n(Doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night, \nOr thinks he sees, the moon's uncertain light,) \nWith tears he first approach'd the sullen shade; \nAnd, as his love inspir'd him, thus he said: \n\"Unhappy queen! then is the common breath \nOf rumor true, in your reported death, \nAnd I, alas! the cause? By Heav'n, I vow, \nAnd all the pow'rs that rule the realms below, \nUnwilling I forsook your friendly state, \nCommanded by the gods, and forc'd by fate- \nThose gods, that fate, whose unresisted might \nHave sent me to these regions void of light, \nThro' the vast empire of eternal night. \nNor dar'd I to presume, that, press'd with grief, \nMy flight should urge you to this dire relief. \nStay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows: \n'T is the last interview that fate allows!\" \nIn vain he thus attempts her mind to move \nWith tears, and pray'rs, and late-repenting love. \nDisdainfully she look'd; then turning round, \nBut fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground, \nAnd what he says and swears, regards no more \nThan the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar; \nBut whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight, \nHid in the forest and the shades of night; \nThen sought Sichaeus thro' the shady grove, \nWho answer'd all her cares, and equal'd all her love. \nSome pious tears the pitying hero paid, \nAnd follow'd with his eyes the flitting shade, \nThen took the forward way, by fate ordain'd, \nAnd, with his guide, the farther fields attain'd, \nWhere, sever'd from the rest, the warrior souls remain'd.\n\nTydeus he met, with Meleager's race, \nThe pride of armies, and the soldiers' grace; \nAnd pale Adrastus with his ghastly face. \nOf Trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train, \nAll much lamented, all in battle slain; \nGlaucus and Medon, high above the rest, \nAntenor's sons, and Ceres' sacred priest. \nAnd proud Idaeus, Priam's charioteer, \nWho shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear. \nThe gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend \nAnd with unwearied eyes behold their friend; \nDelight to hover near, and long to know \nWhat bus'ness brought him to the realms below. \nBut Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train, \nWhen his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain, \nFled from his well-known face, with wonted fear, \nAs when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear \nDrove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear.\n\nThey rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes; \nBut the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats. \nHere Priam's son, Deiphobus, he found, \nWhose face and limbs were one continued wound: \nDishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears, \nSpoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears. \nHe scarcely knew him, striving to disown \nHis blotted form, and blushing to be known; \nAnd therefore first began: \"O Tsucer's race, \nWho durst thy faultless figure thus deface? \nWhat heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace?\n\n'Twas fam'd, that in our last and fatal night \nYour single prowess long sustain'd the fight, \nTill tir'd, not forc'd, a glorious fate you chose, \nAnd fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes. \nBut, in remembrance of so brave a deed, \nA tomb and fun'ral honors I decreed; \nThrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains: \nThe place your armor and your name retains. \nYour body too I sought, and, had I found, \nDesign'd for burial in your native ground.\" \nThe ghost replied: \"Your piety has paid \nAll needful rites, to rest my wand'ring shade; \nBut cruel fate, and my more cruel wife, \nTo Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life. \nThese are the monuments of Helen's love: \nThe shame I bear below, the marks I bore above. \nYou know in what deluding joys we pass'd \nThe night that was by Heav'n decreed our last: \nFor, when the fatal horse, descending down, \nPregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town \nShe feign'd nocturnal orgies; left my bed, \nAnd, mix'd with Trojan dames, the dances led \nThen, waving high her torch, the signal made, \nWhich rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade. \nWith watching overworn, with cares oppress'd, \nUnhappy I had laid me down to rest, \nAnd heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd. \nMeantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid, \nAnd from beneath my head my sword convey'd; \nThe door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls, \nInvites her former lord within my walls. \nThus in her crime her confidence she plac'd, \nAnd with new treasons would redeem the past. \nWhat need I more? Into the room they ran, \nAnd meanly murther'd a defenseless man. \nUlysses, basely born, first led the way. \nAvenging pow'rs! with justice if I pray, \nThat fortune be their own another day! \nBut answer you; and in your turn relate, \nWhat brought you, living, to the Stygian state: \nDriv'n by the winds and errors of the sea, \nOr did you Heav'n's superior doom obey? \nOr tell what other chance conducts your way, \nTo view with mortal eyes our dark retreats, \nTumults and torments of th' infernal seats.\" \nWhile thus in talk the flying hours they pass, \nThe sun had finish'd more than half his race: \nAnd they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent \nThe little time of stay which Heav'n had lent; \nBut thus the Sibyl chides their long delay: \n\"Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day: \n'T is here, in different paths, the way divides; \nThe right to Pluto's golden palace guides; \nThe left to that unhappy region tends, \nWhich to the depth of Tartarus descends; \nThe seat of night profound, and punish'd fiends.\" \nThen thus Deiphobus: \"O sacred maid, \nForbear to chide, and be your will obey'd! \nLo! to the secret shadows I retire, \nTo pay my penance till my years expire. \nProceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown'd, \nAnd born to better fates than I have found.\" \nHe said; and, while he said, his steps he turn'd \nTo secret shadows, and in silence mourn'd. \nThe hero, looking on the left, espied \nA lofty tow'r, and strong on ev'ry side \nWith treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds, \nWhose fiery flood the burning empire bounds; \nAnd, press'd betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds\n\nWide is the fronting gate, and, rais'd on high \nWith adamantine columns, threats the sky. \nVain is the force of man, and Heav'n's as vain, \nTo crush the pillars which the pile sustain. \nSublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd; \nAnd dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward, \nGirt in her sanguine gown, by night and day, \nObservant of the souls that pass the downward way. \nFrom hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains \nOf sounding lashes and of dragging chains. \nThe Trojan stood astonish'd at their cries, \nAnd ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise; \nAnd what the crimes, and what the tortures were, \nAnd loud laments that rent the liquid air. \nShe thus replied: \"The chaste and holy race \nAre all forbidden this polluted place. \nBut Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods, \nThen led me trembling thro' these dire abodes, \nAnd taught the tortures of th' avenging gods. \nThese are the realms of unrelenting fate; \nAnd awful Rhadamanthus rules the state. \nHe hears and judges each committed crime; \nEnquires into the manner, place, and time. \nThe conscious wretch must all his acts reveal, \n(Loth to confess, unable to conceal), \nFrom the first moment of his vital breath, \nTo his last hour of unrepenting death. \nStraight, o'er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes \nThe sounding whip and brandishes her snakes, \nAnd the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes. \nThen, of itself, unfolds th' eternal door; \nWith dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar. \nYou see, before the gate, what stalking ghost \nCommands the guard, what sentries keep the post. \nMore formidable Hydra stands within, \nWhose jaws with iron teeth severely grin. \nThe gaping gulf low to the center lies, \nAnd twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies. \nThe rivals of the gods, the Titan race, \nHere, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd space.\n\nHere lie th' Alaean twins, (I saw them both,) \nEnormous bodies, of gigantic growth, \nWho dar'd in fight the Thund'rer to defy, \nAffect his heav'n, and force him from the sky. \nSalmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains, I found, \nFor emulating Jove; the rattling sound \nOf mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze \nOf pointed lightnings, and their forky rays. \nThro' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew; \nTh' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew: \nHe wav'd a torch aloft, and, madly vain, \nSought godlike worship from a servile train. \nAmbitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass \nO'er hollow arches of resounding brass, \nTo rival thunder in its rapid course, \nAnd imitate inimitable force! \nBut he, the King of Heav'n, obscure on high, \nBar'd his red arm, and, launching from the sky \nHis writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke, \nDown to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook. \nThere Tityus was to see, who took his birth \nFrom heav'n, his nursing from the foodful earth. \nHere his gigantic limbs, with large embrace, \nInfold nine acres of infernal space. \nA rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side, \nHer crooked beak and cruel talons tried; \nStill for the growing liver digg'd his breast; \nThe growing liver still supplied the feast; \nStill are his entrails fruitful to their pains: \nTh' immortal hunger lasts, th' immortal food remains. \nIxion and Perithous I could name, \nAnd more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame. \nHigh o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd, \nThat promises a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast. \nThey lie below, on golden beds display'd; \nAnd genial feasts with regal pomp are made. \nThe Queen of Furies by their sides is set, \nAnd snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat, \nWhich if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears, \nTossing her torch, and thund'ring in their ears. \nThen they, who brothers' better claim disown, \nExpel their parents, and usurp the throne; \nDefraud their clients, and, to lucre sold, \nSit brooding on unprofitable gold; \nWho dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend \nTo their poor kindred, or a wanting friend. \nVast is the throng of these; nor less the train \nOf lustful youths, for foul adult'ry slain: \nHosts of deserters, who their honor sold, \nAnd basely broke their faith for bribes of gold. \nAll these within the dungeon's depth remain, \nDespairing pardon, and expecting pain. \nAsk not what pains; nor farther seek to know \nTheir process, or the forms of law below. \nSome roll a weighty stone; some, laid along, \nAnd bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung\n\nUnhappy Theseus, doom'd for ever there, \nIs fix'd by fate on his eternal chair; \nAnd wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries \n(Could warning make the world more just or wise): \n'Learn righteousness, and dread th' avenging deities.' \nTo tyrants others have their country sold, \nImposing foreign lords, for foreign gold; \nSome have old laws repeal'd, new statutes made, \nNot as the people pleas'd, but as they paid; \nWith incest some their daughters' bed profan'd: \nAll dar'd the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, attain'd.\n\nHad I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, \nAnd throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs, \nI could not half those horrid crimes repeat, \nNor half the punishments those crimes have met. \nBut let us haste our voyage to pursue: \nThe walls of Pluto's palace are in view; \nThe gate, and iron arch above it, stands \nOn anvils labor'd by the Cyclops' hands. \nBefore our farther way the Fates allow, \nHere must we fix on high the golden bough.\" \nShe said: and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd, \nAnd chose the middle path. Arriv'd at last, \nThe prince with living water sprinkled o'er \nHis limbs and body; then approach'd the door, \nPossess'd the porch, and on the front above \nHe fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto's love. \nThese holy rites perform'd, they took their way \nWhere long extended plains of pleasure lay: \nThe verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie, \nWith ether vested, and a purple sky; \nThe blissful seats of happy souls below. \nStars of their own, and their own suns, they know; \nTheir airy limbs in sports they exercise, \nAnd on the green contend the wrestler's prize. \nSome in heroic verse divinely sing; \nOthers in artful measures led the ring. \nThe Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest, \nThere stands conspicuous in his flowing vest; \nHis flying fingers, and harmonious quill, \nStrikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, and sev'n at once they fill.\n\nHere found they Tsucer's old heroic race, \nBorn better times and happier years to grace. \nAssaracus and Ilus here enjoy \nPerpetual fame, with him who founded Troy. \nThe chief beheld their chariots from afar, \nTheir shining arms, and coursers train'd to war: \nTheir lances fix'd in earth, their steeds around, \nFree from their harness, graze the flow'ry ground. \nThe love of horses which they had, alive, \nAnd care of chariots, after death survive. \nSome cheerful souls were feasting on the plain; \nSome did the song, and some the choir maintain, \nBeneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po \nMounts up to woods above, and hides his head below. \nHere patriots live, who, for their country's good, \nIn fighting fields, were prodigal of blood: \nPriests of unblemish'd lives here make abode, \nAnd poets worthy their inspiring god; \nAnd searching wits, of more mechanic parts, \nWho grac'd their age with new-invented arts: \nThose who to worth their bounty did extend, \nAnd those who knew that bounty to commend. \nThe heads of these with holy fillets bound, \nAnd all their temples were with garlands crown'd. \nTo these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd, \nAnd first to him surrounded by the rest \n(Tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast): \n\"Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say, \nWhere lives Anchises, and where lies our way \nTo find the hero, for whose only sake \nWe sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake?\"\n\nTo this the sacred poet thus replied: \n\"In no fix'd place the happy souls reside. \nIn groves we live, and lie on mossy beds, \nBy crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads: \nBut pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; \nThe path conducts you to your journey's end.\" \nThis said, he led them up the mountain's brow, \nAnd shews them all the shining fields below. \nThey wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go. \nBut old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale, \nReview'd his muster'd race, and took the tale: \nThose happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate, \nFor future beings and new bodies wait- \nWith studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng, \nIn nature's order as they pass'd along: \nTheir names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,\n\nIn peaceful senates and successful war. \nHe, when Aeneas on the plain appears, \nMeets him with open arms, and falling tears. \n\"Welcome,\" he said, \"the gods' undoubted race! \nO long expected to my dear embrace! \nOnce more 't is giv'n me to behold your face! \nThe love and pious duty which you pay \nHave pass'd the perils of so hard a way. \n'T is true, computing times, I now believ'd \nThe happy day approach'd; nor are my hopes deceiv'd. \nWhat length of lands, what oceans have you pass'd; \nWhat storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast? \nHow have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most, \nWhen love assail'd you, on the Libyan coast.\" \nTo this, the filial duty thus replies: \n\"Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes \nAppear'd, and often urg'd this painful enterprise. \nAfter long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea, \nMy navy rides at anchor in the bay. \nBut reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun \nThe dear embraces of your longing son!\" \nHe said; and falling tears his face bedew: \nThen thrice around his neck his arms he threw; \nAnd thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away, \nLike winds, or empty dreams that fly the day. \nNow, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees \nA sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze \nPlays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the trees;\n\nAnd, just before the confines of the wood, \nThe gliding Lethe leads her silent flood. \nAbout the boughs an airy nation flew, \nThick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew; \nIn summer's heat on tops of lilies feed, \nAnd creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed: \nThe winged army roams the fields around; \nThe rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound. \nAeneas wond'ring stood, then ask'd the cause \nWhich to the stream the crowding people draws. \nThen thus the sire: \"The souls that throng the flood \nAre those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd: \nIn Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste, \nOf future life secure, forgetful of the past. \nLong has my soul desir'd this time and place, \nTo set before your sight your glorious race, \nThat this presaging joy may fire your mind \nTo seek the shores by destiny design'd.\"- \n\"O father, can it be, that souls sublime \nReturn to visit our terrestrial clime, \nAnd that the gen'rous mind, releas'd by death, \nCan covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?\" \nAnchises then, in order, thus begun \nTo clear those wonders to his godlike son: \n\"Know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame, \nAnd flowing waters, and the starry flame, \nAnd both the radiant lights, one common soul \nInspires and feeds, and animates the whole. \nThis active mind, infus'd thro' all the space, \nUnites and mingles with the mighty mass. \nHence men and beasts the breath of life obtain, \nAnd birds of air, and monsters of the main. \nTh' ethereal vigor is in all the same, \nAnd every soul is fill'd with equal flame; \nAs much as earthy limbs, and gross allay \nOf mortal members, subject to decay, \nBlunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day. \nFrom this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts, \nDesire and fear by turns possess their hearts, \nAnd grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind, \nIn the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd, \nAssert the native skies, or own its heav'nly kind: \nNor death itself can wholly wash their stains; \nBut long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains. \nThe relics of inveterate vice they wear, \nAnd spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear. \nFor this are various penances enjoin'd; \nAnd some are hung to bleach upon the wind, \nSome plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires, \nTill all the dregs are drain'd, and all the rust expires.\n\nAll have their manes, and those manes bear: \nThe few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair, \nAnd breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air. \nThen are they happy, when by length of time \nThe scurf is worn away of each committed crime; \nNo speck is left of their habitual stains, \nBut the pure ether of the soul remains. \nBut, when a thousand rolling years are past, \n(So long their punishments and penance last,) \nWhole droves of minds are, by the driving god, \nCompell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood, \nIn large forgetful draughts to steep the cares \nOf their past labors, and their irksome years, \nThat, unrememb'ring of its former pain, \nThe soul may suffer mortal flesh again.\" \nThus having said, the father spirit leads \nThe priestess and his son thro' swarms of shades, \nAnd takes a rising ground, from thence to see \nThe long procession of his progeny. \n\"Survey,\" pursued the sire, \"this airy throng, \nAs, offer'd to thy view, they pass along. \nThese are th' Italian names, which fate will join \nWith ours, and graff upon the Trojan line. \nObserve the youth who first appears in sight, \nAnd holds the nearest station to the light, \nAlready seems to snuff the vital air, \nAnd leans just forward, on a shining spear: \nSilvius is he, thy last-begotten race, \nBut first in order sent, to fill thy place; \nAn Alban name, but mix'd with Dardan blood, \nBorn in the covert of a shady wood: \nHim fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife, \nShall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life. \nIn Alba he shall fix his royal seat, \nAnd, born a king, a race of kings beget. \nThen Procas, honor of the Trojan name, \nCapys, and Numitor, of endless fame. \nA second Silvius after these appears; \nSilvius Aeneas, for thy name he bears; \nFor arms and justice equally renown'd, \nWho, late restor'd, in Alba shall be crown'd. \nHow great they look! how vig'rously they wield \nTheir weighty lances, and sustain the shield! \nBut they, who crown'd with oaken wreaths appear, \nShall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear; \nNomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found; \nAnd raise Collatian tow'rs on rocky ground. \nAll these shall then be towns of mighty fame, \nTho' now they lie obscure, and lands without a name. \nSee Romulus the great, born to restore \nThe crown that once his injur'd grandsire wore. \nThis prince a priestess of your blood shall bear, \nAnd like his sire in arms he shall appear. \nTwo rising crests, his royal head adorn; \nBorn from a god, himself to godhead born: \nHis sire already signs him for the skies, \nAnd marks the seat amidst the deities. \nAuspicious chief! thy race, in times to come, \nShall spread the conquests of imperial Rome- \nRome, whose ascending tow'rs shall heav'n invade, \nInvolving earth and ocean in her shade; \nHigh as the Mother of the Gods in place, \nAnd proud, like her, of an immortal race. \nThen, when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round, \nWith golden turrets on her temples crown'd; \nA hundred gods her sweeping train supply; \nHer offspring all, and all command the sky. \n\"Now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see \nYour Roman race, and Julian progeny. \nThe mighty Caesar waits his vital hour, \nImpatient for the world, and grasps his promis'd pow'r. \nBut next behold the youth of form divine, \nCeasar himself, exalted in his line; \nAugustus, promis'd oft, and long foretold, \nSent to the realm that Saturn rul'd of old; \nBorn to restore a better age of gold. \nAfric and India shall his pow'r obey; \nHe shall extend his propagated sway \nBeyond the solar year, without the starry way, \nWhere Atlas turns the rolling heav'ns around, \nAnd his broad shoulders with their lights are crown'd. \nAt his foreseen approach, already quake \nThe Caspian kingdoms and Maeotian lake: \nTheir seers behold the tempest from afar, \nAnd threat'ning oracles denounce the war. \nNile hears him knocking at his sev'nfold gates, \nAnd seeks his hidden spring, and fears his nephew's fates.\n\nNor Hercules more lands or labors knew, \nNot tho' the brazen-footed hind he slew, \nFreed Erymanthus from the foaming boar, \nAnd dipp'd his arrows in Lernaean gore; \nNor Bacchus, turning from his Indian war, \nBy tigers drawn triumphant in his car, \nFrom Nisus' top descending on the plains, \nWith curling vines around his purple reins. \nAnd doubt we yet thro' dangers to pursue \nThe paths of honor, and a crown in view? \nBut what's the man, who from afar appears? \nHis head with olive crown'd, his hand a censer bears, \nHis hoary beard and holy vestments bring \nHis lost idea back: I know the Roman king. \nHe shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain, \nCall'd from his mean abode a scepter to sustain. \nHim Tullus next in dignity succeeds, \nAn active prince, and prone to martial deeds. \nHe shall his troops for fighting fields prepare, \nDisus'd to toils, and triumphs of the war. \nBy dint of sword his crown he shall increase, \nAnd scour his armor from the rust of peace. \nWhom Ancus follows, with a fawning air, \nBut vain within, and proudly popular. \nNext view the Tarquin kings, th' avenging sword \nOf Brutus, justly drawn, and Rome restor'd. \nHe first renews the rods and ax severe, \nAnd gives the consuls royal robes to wear. \nHis sons, who seek the tyrant to sustain, \nAnd long for arbitrary lords again, \nWith ignominy scourg'd, in open sight, \nHe dooms to death deserv'd, asserting public right. \nUnhappy man, to break the pious laws \nOf nature, pleading in his children's cause! \nHoweer the doubtful fact is understood, \n'T is love of honor, and his country's good: \nThe consul, not the father, sheds the blood. \nBehold Torquatus the same track pursue; \nAnd, next, the two devoted Decii view: \nThe Drusian line, Camillus loaded home \nWith standards well redeem'd, and foreign foes o'ercome \nThe pair you see in equal armor shine, \nNow, friends below, in close embraces join; \nBut, when they leave the shady realms of night, \nAnd, cloth'd in bodies, breathe your upper light, \nWith mortal hate each other shall pursue: \nWhat wars, what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue! \nFrom Alpine heights the father first descends; \nHis daughter's husband in the plain attends: \nHis daughter's husband arms his eastern friends. \nEmbrace again, my sons, be foes no more; \nNor stain your country with her children's gore! \nAnd thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim, \nThou, of my blood, who bearist the Julian name! \nAnother comes, who shall in triumph ride, \nAnd to the Capitol his chariot guide, \nFrom conquer'd Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils. \nAnd yet another, fam'd for warlike toils, \nOn Argos shall impose the Roman laws, \nAnd on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause; \nShall drag in chains their Achillean race; \nShall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace, \nAnd Pallas, for her violated place. \nGreat Cato there, for gravity renown'd, \nAnd conqu'ring Cossus goes with laurels crown'd. \nWho can omit the Gracchi? who declare \nThe Scipios' worth, those thunderbolts of war, \nThe double bane of Carthage? Who can see \nWithout esteem for virtuous poverty, \nSevere Fabricius, or can cease t' admire \nThe plowman consul in his coarse attire? \nTir'd as I am, my praise the Fabii claim; \nAnd thou, great hero, greatest of thy name, \nOrdain'd in war to save the sinking state, \nAnd, by delays, to put a stop to fate! \nLet others better mold the running mass \nOf metals, and inform the breathing brass, \nAnd soften into flesh a marble face; \nPlead better at the bar; describe the skies, \nAnd when the stars descend, and when they rise. \nBut, Rome, 't is thine alone, with awful sway, \nTo rule mankind, and make the world obey, \nDisposing peace and war by thy own majestic way; \nTo tame the proud, the fetter'd slave to free: \nThese are imperial arts, and worthy thee.\" \nHe paus'd; and, while with wond'ring eyes they view'd \nThe passing spirits, thus his speech renew'd: \n\"See great Marcellus! how, untir'd in toils, \nHe moves with manly grace, how rich with regal spoils! \nHe, when his country, threaten'd with alarms, \nRequires his courage and his conqu'ring arms, \nShall more than once the Punic bands affright; \nShall kill the Gaulish king in single fight; \nThen to the Capitol in triumph move, \nAnd the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove.\" \nAeneas here beheld, of form divine, \nA godlike youth in glitt'ring armor shine, \nWith great Marcellus keeping equal pace; \nBut gloomy were his eyes, dejected was his face. \nHe saw, and, wond'ring, ask'd his airy guide, \nWhat and of whence was he, who press'd the hero's side: \n\"His son, or one of his illustrious name? \nHow like the former, and almost the same! \nObserve the crowds that compass him around; \nAll gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting sound: \nBut hov'ring mists around his brows are spread, \nAnd night, with sable shades, involves his head.\" \n\"Seek not to know,\" the ghost replied with tears, \n\"The sorrows of thy sons in future years. \nThis youth (the blissful vision of a day) \nShall just be shown on earth, and snatch'd away. \nThe gods too high had rais'd the Roman state, \nWere but their gifts as permanent as great. \nWhat groans of men shall fill the Martian field! \nHow fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield! \nWhat fun'ral pomp shall floating Tiber see, \nWhen, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity! \nNo youth shall equal hopes of glory give, \nNo youth afford so great a cause to grieve; \nThe Trojan honor, and the Roman boast, \nAdmir'd when living, and ador'd when lost! \nMirror of ancient faith in early youth! \nUndaunted worth, inviolable truth! \nNo foe, unpunish'd, in the fighting field \nShall dare thee, foot to foot, with sword and shield; \nMuch less in arms oppose thy matchless force, \nWhen thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse. \nAh! couldst thou break thro' fate's severe decree, \nA new Marcellus shall arise in thee! \nFull canisters of fragrant lilies bring, \nMix'd with the purple roses of the spring; \nLet me with fun'ral flow'rs his body strow; \nThis gift which parents to their children owe, \nThis unavailing gift, at least, I may bestow!\" \nThus having said, he led the hero round \nThe confines of the blest Elysian ground; \nWhich when Anchises to his son had shown, \nAnd fir'd his mind to mount the promis'd throne, \nHe tells the future wars, ordain'd by fate; \nThe strength and customs of the Latian state; \nThe prince, and people; and forearms his care \nWith rules, to push his fortune, or to bear. \nTwo gates the silent house of Sleep adorn; \nOf polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn: \nTrue visions thro' transparent horn arise; \nThro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies. \nOf various things discoursing as he pass'd, \nAnchises hither bends his steps at last. \nThen, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd \nHis valiant offspring and divining guest. \nStraight to the ships Aeneas his way, \nEmbark'd his men, and skimm'd along the sea, \nStill coasting, till he gain'd Cajeta's bay. \nAt length on oozy ground his galleys moor; \nTheir heads are turn'd to sea, their sterns to shore. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VII\n\nAnd thou, O matron of immortal fame, \nHere dying, to the shore hast left thy name; \nCajeta still the place is call'd from thee, \nThe nurse of great Aeneas' infancy. \nHere rest thy bones in rich Hesperia's plains; \nThy name ('t is all a ghost can have) remains. \nNow, when the prince her fun'ral rites had paid, \nHe plow'd the Tyrrhene seas with sails display'd. \nFrom land a gentle breeze arose by night, \nSerenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, \nAnd the sea trembled with her silver light. \nNow near the shelves of Circe's shores they run, \n(Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) \nA dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days \nIn joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays: \nIn spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, \nAnd cedar brands supply her father's light. \nFrom hence were heard, rebellowing to the main, \nThe roars of lions that refuse the chain, \nThe grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, \nAnd herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.\n\nThese from their caverns, at the close of night, \nFill the sad isle with horror and affright. \nDarkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r, \n(That watch'd the moon and planetary hour,) \nWith words and wicked herbs from humankind \nHad alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd. \nWhich monsters lest the Trojans' pious host \nShould bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast, \nPropitious Neptune steer'd their course by night \nWith rising gales that sped their happy flight. \nSupplied with these, they skim the sounding shore, \nAnd hear the swelling surges vainly roar. \nNow, when the rosy morn began to rise, \nAnd wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies; \nWhen Thetis blush'd in purple not her own, \nAnd from her face the breathing winds were blown, \nA sudden silence sate upon the sea, \nAnd sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way. \nThe Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood, \nWhich thick with shades and a brown horror stood: \nBetwixt the trees the Tiber took his course, \nWith whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force, \nThat drove the sand along, he took his way, \nAnd roll'd his yellow billows to the sea. \nAbout him, and above, and round the wood, \nThe birds that haunt the borders of his flood, \nThat bath'd within, or basked upon his side, \nTo tuneful songs their narrow throats applied. \nThe captain gives command; the joyful train \nGlide thro' the gloomy shade, and leave the main. \nNow, Erato, thy poet's mind inspire, \nAnd fill his soul with thy celestial fire! \nRelate what Latium was; her ancient kings; \nDeclare the past and state of things, \nWhen first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought, \nAnd how the rivals lov'd, and how they fought. \nThese are my theme, and how the war began, \nAnd how concluded by the godlike man: \nFor I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage, \nWhich princes and their people did engage; \nAnd haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate, \nIn fighting fields pursued and found their fate; \nThat rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms, \nAnd peaceful Italy involv'd in arms. \nA larger scene of action is display'd; \nAnd, rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd. \nLatinus, old and mild, had long possess'd \nThe Latin scepter, and his people blest: \nHis father Faunus; a Laurentian dame \nHis mother; fair Marica was her name. \nBut Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew \nHis birth from Saturn, if records be true. \nThus King Latinus, in the third degree, \nHad Saturn author of his family. \nBut this old peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed, \nWas blest with no male issue to succeed: \nHis sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate; \nOne only daughter heir'd the royal state. \nFir'd with her love, and with ambition led, \nThe neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed. \nAmong the crowd, but far above the rest, \nYoung Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd. \nTurnus, for high descent and graceful mien, \nWas first, and favor'd by the Latian queen; \nWith him she strove to join Lavinia's hand, \nBut dire portents the purpos'd match withstand. \nDeep in the palace, of long growth, there stood \nA laurel's trunk, a venerable wood; \nWhere rites divine were paid; whose holy hair \nWas kept and cut with superstitious care. \nThis plant Latinus, when his town he wall'd, \nThen found, and from the tree Laurentum call'd; \nAnd last, in honor of his new abode, \nHe vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god. \nIt happen'd once (a boding prodigy!) \nA swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky, \n(Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,) \nUpon the topmost branch in clouds alight; \nThere with their clasping feet together clung, \nAnd a long cluster from the laurel hung. \nAn ancient augur prophesied from hence: \n\"Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince! \nFrom the same parts of heav'n his navy stands, \nTo the same parts on earth; his army lands; \nThe town he conquers, and the tow'r commands.\" \nYet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire \nBefore the gods, and stood beside her sire, \n(Strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke \nOf incense, from the sacred altar broke, \nCaught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire; \nHer crown and jewels crackled in the fire: \nFrom thence the fuming trail began to spread \nAnd lambent glories danc'd about her head. \nThis new portent the seer with wonder views, \nThen pausing, thus his prophecy renews: \n\"The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around, \nShall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd; \nBut, caus'd by her irrevocable fate, \nWar shall the country waste, and change the state.\" \nLatinus, frighted with this dire ostent, \nFor counsel to his father Faunus went, \nAnd sought the shades renown'd for prophecy \nWhich near Albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie. \nTo these the Latian and the Sabine land \nFly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand. \nThe priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease, \nAnd nightly visions in his slumber sees; \nA swarm of thin aerial shapes appears, \nAnd, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears: \nThese he consults, the future fates to know, \nFrom pow'rs above, and from the fiends below. \nHere, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies, \nOff'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice: \nTheir woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd, \nHe laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd. \nNo sooner were his eyes in slumber bound, \nWhen, from above, a more than mortal sound \nInvades his ears; and thus the vision spoke: \n\"Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke \nOur fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke. \nA foreign son upon thy shore descends, \nWhose martial fame from pole to pole extends. \nHis race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd, \nNot Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound: \n'T is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around.\" \nThese answers, in the silent night receiv'd, \nThe king himself divulg'd, the land believ'd: \nThe fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew, \nWhen now the Trojan navy was in view. \nBeneath a shady tree, the hero spread \nHis table on the turf, with cakes of bread; \nAnd, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed. \nThey sate; and, (not without the god's command,) \nTheir homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band \nInvade their trenchers next, and soon devour, \nTo mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour. \nAscanius this observ'd, and smiling said: \n\"See, we devour the plates on which we fed.\" \nThe speech had omen, that the Trojan race \nShould find repose, and this the time and place. \nAeneas took the word, and thus replies, \nConfessing fate with wonder in his eyes: \n\"All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods! \nBehold the destin'd place of your abodes! \nFor thus Anchises prophesied of old, \nAnd this our fatal place of rest foretold: \n'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat, \nBy famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat, \nThen ease your weary Trojans will attend, \nAnd the long labors of your voyage end. \nRemember on that happy coast to build, \nAnd with a trench inclose the fruitful field.' \nThis was that famine, this the fatal place \nWhich ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race. \nThen, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ, \nTo search the land, and where the cities lie, \nAnd what the men; but give this day to joy. \nNow pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest, \nCall great Anchises to the genial feast: \nCrown high the goblets with a cheerful draught; \nEnjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought.\" \nThus having said, the hero bound his brows \nWith leafy branches, then perform'd his vows; \nAdoring first the genius of the place, \nThen Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race, \nThe nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown, \nAnd Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne,\n\nAnd ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove, \nAnd last his sire below, and mother queen above. \nThen heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud, \nAnd thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud. \nSoon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew, \nThe time was come their city to renew. \nThen ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd, \nThe feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round. \nWhen next the rosy morn disclos'd the day, \nThe scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way, \nTo learn the natives' names, their towns explore, \nThe coasts and trendings of the crooked shore: \nHere Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands; \nHere warlike Latins hold the happy lands. \nThe pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways \nTo found his empire, and his town to raise, \nA hundred youths from all his train selects, \nAnd to the Latian court their course directs, \n(The spacious palace where their prince resides,) \nAnd all their heads with wreaths of olive hides. \nThey go commission'd to require a peace, \nAnd carry presents to procure access. \nThus while they speed their pace, the prince designs \nHis new-elected seat, and draws the lines. \nThe Trojans round the place a rampire cast, \nAnd palisades about the trenches plac'd. \nMeantime the train, proceeding on their way, \nFrom far the town and lofty tow'rs survey; \nAt length approach the walls. Without the gate, \nThey see the boys and Latian youth debate \nThe martial prizes on the dusty plain: \nSome drive the cars, and some the coursers rein; \nSome bend the stubborn bow for victory, \nAnd some with darts their active sinews try. \nA posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence, \nOf this fair troop advis'd their aged prince, \nThat foreign men of mighty stature came; \nUncouth their habit, and unknown their name. \nThe king ordains their entrance, and ascends \nHis regal seat, surrounded by his friends. \nThe palace built by Picus, vast and proud, \nSupported by a hundred pillars stood, \nAnd round incompass'd with a rising wood. \nThe pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew the sight; \nSurpris'd at once with reverence and delight. \nThere kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r; \nIn state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore \nTheir awful axes and the rods before. \nHere the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r, \nAnd here the sacred senators repair; \nAll at large tables, in long order set, \nA ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat. \nAbove the portal, carv'd in cedar wood, \nPlac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood; \nOld Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high; \nAnd Italus, that led the colony; \nAnd ancient Janus, with his double face, \nAnd bunch of keys, the porter of the place. \nThere good Sabinus, planter of the vines, \nOn a short pruning hook his head reclines, \nAnd studiously surveys his gen'rous wines; \nThen warlike kings, who for their country fought, \nAnd honorable wounds from battle brought. \nAround the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears, \nAnd captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars, \nAnd broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars. \nAbove the rest, as chief of all the band, \nWas Picus plac'd, a buckler in his hand; \nHis other wav'd a long divining wand. \nGirt in his Gabin gown the hero sate, \nYet could not with his art avoid his fate: \nFor Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain, \nTill love, refus'd, converted to disdain: \nThen, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art, \nShe chang'd his form, who could not change his heart; \nConstrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly, \nWith party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie. \nIn this high temple, on a chair of state, \nThe seat of audience, old Latinus sate; \nThen gave admission to the Trojan train; \nAnd thus with pleasing accents he began: \n\"Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own, \nNor is your course upon our coasts unknown- \nSay what you seek, and whither were you bound: \nWere you by stress of weather cast aground? \n(Such dangers as on seas are often seen, \nAnd oft befall to miserable men,) \nOr come, your shipping in our ports to lay, \nSpent and disabled in so long a way? \nSay what you want: the Latians you shall find \nNot forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd; \nFor, since the time of Saturn's holy reign, \nHis hospitable customs we retain. \nI call to mind (but time the tale has worn) \nTh' Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho' born \nOn Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore, \nAnd Samothracia, Samos call'd before. \nFrom Tuscan Coritum he claim'd his birth; \nBut after, when exempt from mortal earth, \nFrom thence ascended to his kindred skies, \nA god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice,\" \nHe said. Ilioneus made this reply: \n\"O king, of Faunus' royal family! \nNor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way, \nNor did the stars our wand'ring course betray. \nWilling we sought your shores; and, hither bound, \nThe port, so long desir'd, at length we found; \nFrom our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd; \nGreat as the greatest that the sun beheld. \nThe god began our line, who rules above; \nAnd, as our race, our king descends from Jove: \nAnd hither are we come, by his command, \nTo crave admission in your happy land. \nHow dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour'd, \nOur plains, our temples, and our town devour'd; \nWhat was the waste of war, what fierce alarms \nShook Asia's crown with European arms; \nEv'n such have heard, if any such there be, \nWhose earth is bounded by the frozen sea; \nAnd such as, born beneath the burning sky \nAnd sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie. \nFrom that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste, \nSuch length of years, such various perils past, \nAt last escap'd, to Latium we repair, \nTo beg what you without your want may spare: \nThe common water, and the common air; \nSheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes, \nFit to receive and serve our banish'd gods. \nNor our admission shall your realm disgrace, \nNor length of time our gratitude efface. \nBesides, what endless honor you shall gain, \nTo save and shelter Troy's unhappy train! \nNow, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear, \nRenown'd for faith in peace, for force in war; \nOft our alliance other lands desir'd, \nAnd, what we seek of you, of us requir'd. \nDespite not then, that in our hands we bear \nThese holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r. \nFate and the gods, by their supreme command, \nHave doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land. \nTo these abodes our fleet Apollo sends; \nHere Dardanus was born, and hither tends; \nWhere Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force, \nAnd where Numicus opes his holy source. \nBesides, our prince presents, with his request, \nSome small remains of what his sire possess'd. \nThis golden charger, snatch'd from burning Troy, \nAnchises did in sacrifice employ; \nThis royal robe and this tiara wore \nOld Priam, and this golden scepter bore \nIn full assemblies, and in solemn games; \nThese purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames.\" \nThus while he spoke, Latinus roll'd around \nHis eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground. \nIntent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast; \nNot by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest, \nBut pond'ring future things of wondrous weight; \nSuccession, empire, and his daughter's fate. \nOn these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind, \nAnd then revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd. \nThis was the foreign prince, by fate decreed \nTo share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed; \nThis was the race that sure portents foreshew \nTo sway the world, and land and sea subdue. \nAt length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke: \n\"The pow'rs,\" said he, \"the pow'rs we both invoke, \nTo you, and yours, and mine, propitious be, \nAnd firm our purpose with their augury! \nHave what you ask; your presents I receive; \nLand, where and when you please, with ample leave; \nPartake and use my kingdom as your own; \nAll shall be yours, while I command the crown: \nAnd, if my wish'd alliance please your king, \nTell him he should not send the peace, but bring. \nThen let him not a friend's embraces fear; \nThe peace is made when I behold him here. \nBesides this answer, tell my royal guest, \nI add to his commands my own request: \nOne only daughter heirs my crown and state, \nWhom not our oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate, \nNor frequent prodigies, permit to join \nWith any native of th' Ausonian line. \nA foreign son-in-law shall come from far \n(Such is our doom), a chief renown'd in war, \nWhose race shall bear aloft the Latian name, \nAnd thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame. \nHimself to be the man the fates require, \nI firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire.\" \nHe said, and then on each bestow'd a steed. \nThree hundred horses, in high stables fed, \nStood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd: \nOf these he chose the fairest and the best, \nTo mount the Trojan troop. At his command \nThe steeds caparison'd with purple stand, \nWith golden trappings, glorious to behold, \nAnd champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold. \nThen to his absent guest the king decreed \nA pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed, \nWho from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire; \nWhom Circe stole from her celestial sire, \nBy substituting mares produc'd on earth, \nWhose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth. \nThese draw the chariot which Latinus sends, \nAnd the rich present to the prince commends. \nSublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, \nTo their expecting lord with peace return. \nBut jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height, \nAs she from Argos took her airy flight, \nBeheld with envious eyes this hateful sight. \nShe saw the Trojan and his joyful train \nDescend upon the shore, desert the main, \nDesign a town, and, with unhop'd success, \nTh' embassadors return with promis'd peace. \nThen, pierc'd with pain, she shook her haughty head, \nSigh'd from her inward soul, and thus she said: \n\"O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes! \nO fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose! \nCould they not fall unpitied on the plain, \nBut slain revive, and, taken, scape again? \nWhen execrable Troy in ashes lay, \nThro' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their way. \nThen vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend, \nHer rage disarm'd, her empire at an end. \nBreathless and tir'd, is all my fury spent? \nOr does my glutted spleen at length relent? \nAs if 't were little from their town to chase, \nI thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race; \nIngag'd the heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main; \nBut billows roar'd, and tempests rag'd in vain. \nWhat have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, \nWhen these they overpass, and those they shun? \nOn Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate, \nTriumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate. \nMars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, \nAnd Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath, \nWho sent the tusky boar to Calydon; \n(What great offense had either people done?) \nBut I, the consort of the Thunderer, \nHave wag'd a long and unsuccessful war, \nWith various arts and arms in vain have toil'd, \nAnd by a mortal man at length am foil'd. \nIf native pow'r prevail not, shall I doubt \nTo seek for needful succor from without? \nIf Jove and Heav'n my just desires deny, \nHell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove supply. \nGrant that the Fates have firm'd, by their decree, \nThe Trojan race to reign in Italy; \nAt least I can defer the nuptial day, \nAnd with protracted wars the peace delay: \nWith blood the dear alliance shall be bought, \nAnd both the people near destruction brought; \nSo shall the son-in-law and father join, \nWith ruin, war, and waste of either line. \nO fatal maid, thy marriage is endow'd \nWith Phrygian, Latian, andRutulian blood! \nBellona leads thee to thy lover's hand; \nAnother queen brings forth another brand, \nTo burn with foreign fires another land! \nA second Paris, diff'ring but in name, \nShall fire his country with a second flame.\" \nThus having said, she sinks beneath the ground, \nWith furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound, \nTo rouse Alecto from th' infernal seat \nOf her dire sisters, and their dark retreat. \nThis Fury, fit for her intent, she chose; \nOne who delights in wars and human woes. \nEv'n Pluto hates his own misshapen race; \nHer sister Furies fly her hideous face; \nSo frightful are the forms the monster takes, \nSo fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes. \nHer Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite: \n\"O virgin daughter of eternal Night, \nGive me this once thy labor, to sustain \nMy right, and execute my just disdain. \nLet not the Trojans, with a feign'd pretense \nOf proffer'd peace, delude the Latian prince. \nExpel from Italy that odious name, \nAnd let not Juno suffer in her fame. \n'T is thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a state, \nBetwixt the dearest friends to raise debate, \nAnd kindle kindred blood to mutual hate. \nThy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays, \nAnd forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways. \nNow shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds \nOf envy, discord, and of cruel deeds: \nConfound the peace establish'd, and prepare \nTheir souls to hatred, and their hands to war.\" \nSmear'd as she was with black Gorgonian blood, \nThe Fury sprang above the Stygian flood; \nAnd on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night, \nShe to the Latian palace took her flight: \nThere sought the queen's apartment, stood before \nThe peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door. \nRestless Amata lay, her swelling breast \nFir'd with disdain for Turnus dispossess'd, \nAnd the new nuptials of the Trojan guest. \nFrom her black bloody locks the Fury shakes \nHer darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes; \nWith her full force she threw the poisonous dart, \nAnd fix'd it deep within Amata's heart, \nThat, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage, \nAnd sacrifice to strife her house husband's age. \nUnseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims \nBetwixt her linen and her naked limbs; \nHis baleful breath inspiring, as he glides, \nNow like a chain around her neck he rides, \nNow like a fillet to her head repairs, \nAnd with his circling volumes folds her hairs. \nAt first the silent venom slid with ease, \nAnd seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees; \nThen, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far, \nIn plaintive accents she began the war, \nAnd thus bespoke her husband: \"Shall,\" she said, \n\"A wand'ring prince enjoy Lavinia's bed? \nIf nature plead not in a parent's heart, \nPity my tears, and pity her desert. \nI know, my dearest lord, the time will come, \nYou in vain, reverse your cruel doom; \nThe faithless pirate soon will set to sea, \nAnd bear the royal virgin far away! \nA guest like him, a Trojan guest before, \nIn shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore, \nAnd ravish'd Helen from her husband bore. \nThink on a king's inviolable word; \nAnd think on Turnus, her once plighted lord: \nTo this false foreigner you give your throne, \nAnd wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son. \nResume your ancient care; and, if the god \nYour sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood, \nKnow all are foreign, in a larger sense, \nNot born your subjects, or deriv'd from hence. \nThen, if the line of Turnus you retrace, \nHe springs from Inachus of Argive race.\" \nBut when she saw her reasons idly spent, \nAnd could not move him from his fix'd intent, \nShe flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd \nHer vital parts, and poison'd all her breast; \nShe raves, she runs with a distracted pace, \nAnd fills with horrid howls the public place. \nAnd, as young striplings whip the top for sport, \nOn the smooth pavement of an empty court; \nThe wooden engine flies and whirls about, \nAdmir'd, with clamors, of the beardless rout; \nThey lash aloud; each other they provoke, \nAnd lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke: \nThus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows \nAmidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes. \nNor yet content, she strains her malice more, \nAnd adds new ills to those contriv'd before: \nShe flies the town, and, mixing with a throng \nOf madding matrons, bears the bride along, \nWand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways, \nAnd with these arts the Trojan match delays. \nShe feign'd the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud, \nAnd to the buxom god the virgin vow'd. \n\"Evoe! O Bacchus!\" thus began the song; \nAnd \"Evoe!\" answer'd all the female throng. \n\"O virgin! worthy thee alone!\" she cried; \n\"O worthy thee alone!\" the crew replied. \n\"For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance, \nAnd with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance.\" \nLike fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known, \nAll seek the mountains, and forsake the town: \nAll, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear, \nGive to the wanton winds their flowing hair, \nAnd shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air. \nThe queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine, \nShook high above her head a flaming pine; \nThen roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng, \nAnd sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song: \n\"Io, ye Latian dames! if any here \nHold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear; \nIf there be here,\" she said, who dare maintain \nMy right, nor think the name of mother vain; \nUnbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair, \nAnd orgies and nocturnal rites prepare.\" \nAmata's breast the Fury thus invades, \nAnd fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades; \nThen, when she found her venom spread so far, \nThe royal house embroil'd in civil war, \nRais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies, \nAnd seeks the palace where young Turnus lies. \nHis town, as fame reports, was built of old \nBy Danae, pregnant with almighty gold, \nWho fled her father's rage, and, with a train \nOf following Argives, thro' the stormy main, \nDriv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign. \n'T was Ardua once; now Ardea's name it bears; \nOnce a fair city, now consum'd with years. \nHere, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay, \nBetwixt the confines of the night and day, \nSecure in sleep. The Fury laid aside \nHer looks and limbs, and with new methods tried \nThe foulness of th' infernal form to hide. \nPropp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien: \nHer face is furrow'd, and her front obscene; \nDeep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws; \nSunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws; \nHer hoary hair with holy fillets bound, \nHer temples with an olive wreath are crown'd. \nOld Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane \nOf Juno, now she seem'd, and thus began, \nAppearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man: \n\"Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain \nIn fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain? \nWin, for a Trojan head to wear the prize, \nUsurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories? \nThe bride and scepter which thy blood has bought, \nThe king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought. \nGo now, deluded man, and seek again \nNew toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain. \nRepel the Tuscan foes; their city seize; \nProtect the Latians in luxurious ease. \nThis dream all-pow'rful Juno sends; I bear \nHer mighty mandates, and her words you hear. \nHaste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain; \nWith fate to friend, assault the Trojan train: \nTheir thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie \nIn Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy. \nThe Latian king, unless he shall submit, \nOwn his old promise, and his new forget- \nLet him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove, \nAnd learn to fear whom he disdains to love. \nFor such is Heav'n's command.\" The youthful prince \nWith scorn replied, and made this bold defense: \n\"You tell me, mother, what I knew before: \nThe Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore. \nI neither fear nor will provoke the war; \nMy fate is Juno's most peculiar care. \nBut time has made you dote, and vainly tell \nOf arms imagin'd in your lonely cell. \nGo; be the temple and the gods your care; \nPermit to men the thought of peace and war.\" \nThese haughty words Alecto's rage provoke, \nAnd frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke. \nHer eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn; \nHer hideous looks and hellish form return; \nHer curling snakes with hissings fill the place, \nAnd open all the furies of her face: \nThen, darting fire from her malignant eyes, \nShe cast him backward as he strove to rise, \nAnd, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies. \nHigh on her head she rears two twisted snakes, \nHer chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes; \nAnd, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks: \n\"Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell \nOf arms imagin'd in her lonely cell! \nBehold the Fates' infernal minister! \nWar, death, destruction, in my hand I bear.\" \nThus having said, her smold'ring torch, impress'd \nWith her full force, she plung'd into his breast. \nAghast he wak'd; and, starting from his bed, \nCold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread. \n\"Arms! arms!\" he cries: \"my sword and shield prepare!\" \nHe breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war. \nSo, when with crackling flames a caldron fries, \nThe bubbling waters from the bottom rise: \nAbove the brims they force their fiery way; \nBlack vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day. \nThe peace polluted thus, a chosen band \nHe first commissions to the Latian land, \nIn threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest, \nTo meet in arms th' intruding Trojan guest, \nTo force the foes from the Lavinian shore, \nAnd Italy's indanger'd peace restore. \nHimself alone an equal match he boasts, \nTo fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts. \nThe gods invok'd, the Rutuli prepare \nTheir arms, and warn each other to the war. \nHis beauty these, and those his blooming age, \nThe rest his house and his own fame ingage. \nWhile Turnus urges thus his enterprise, \nThe Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies; \nNew frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand, \nWhich overlooks the vale with wide command; \nWhere fair Ascanius and his youthful train, \nWith horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain, \nAnd pitch their toils around the shady plain. \nThe Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent, \nAnd feed their hungry nostrils with the scent. \n'Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise \nHigh o'er his front; his beams invade the skies. \nFrom this light cause th' infernal maid prepares \nThe country churls to mischief, hate, and wars. \nThe stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred, \nSnatch'd from his dams, and the tame youngling fed. \nTheir father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring, \nTyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king: \nTheir sister Silvia cherish'd with her care \nThe little wanton, and did wreaths prepare \nTo hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied \nHis tender neck, and comb'd his silken hide, \nAnd bathed his body. Patient of command \nIn time he grew, and, growing us'd to hand, \nHe waited at his master's board for food; \nThen sought his salvage kindred in the wood, \nWhere grazing all the day, at night he came \nTo his known lodgings, and his country dame. \nThis household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds, \nWas view'd at first by the young hero's hounds, \nAs down the stream he swam, to seek retreat \nIn the cool waters, and to quench his heat. \nAscanius young, and eager of his game, \nSoon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim; \nBut the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides, \nWhich pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides. \nThe bleeding creature issues from the floods, \nPossess'd with fear, and seeks his known abodes, \nHis old familiar hearth and household gods. \nHe falls; he fills the house with heavy groans, \nImplores their pity, and his pain bemoans. \nYoung Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud \nFor succor from the clownish neighborhood: \nThe churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay \nIn the close woody covert, urg'd their way. \nOne with a brand yet burning from the flame, \nArm'd with a knotty club another came: \nWhate'er they catch or find, without their care, \nTheir fury makes an instrument of war. \nTyrrheus, the foster father of the beast, \nThen clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist, \nBut held his hand from the descending stroke, \nAnd left his wedge within the cloven oak, \nTo whet their courage and their rage provoke. \nAnd now the goddess, exercis'd in ill, \nWho watch'd an hour to work her impious will, \nAscends the roof, and to her crooked horn, \nSuch as was then by Latian shepherds borne, \nAdds all her breath: the rocks and woods around, \nAnd mountains, tremble at th' infernal sound. \nThe sacred lake of Trivia from afar, \nThe Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar, \nShake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war. \nYoung mothers wildly stare, with fear possess'd, \nAnd strain their helpless infants to their breast. \nThe clowns, a boist'rous, rude, ungovern'd crew, \nWith furious haste to the loud summons flew. \nThe pow'rs of Troy, then issuing on the plain, \nWith fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain: \nNot theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train, \nBut a firm body of embattled men. \nAt first, while fortune favor'd neither side, \nThe fight with clubs and burning brands was tried; \nBut now, both parties reinforc'd, the fields \nAre bright with flaming swords and brazen shields. \nA shining harvest either host displays, \nAnd shoots against the sun with equal rays. \nThus, when a black-brow'd gust begins to rise, \nWhite foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries; \nThen roars the main, the billows mount the skies; \nTill, by the fury of the storm full blown, \nThe muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown. \nFirst Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care, \nPierc'd with an arrow from the distant war: \nFix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood, \nAnd stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital blood \nHuge heaps of slain around the body rise: \nAmong the rest, the rich Galesus lies; \nA good old man, while peace he preach'd in vain, \nAmidst the madness of th' unruly train: \nFive herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill'd; \nHis lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd. \nThus, while in equal scales their fortune stood \nThe Fury bath'd them in each other's blood; \nThen, having fix'd the fight, exulting flies, \nAnd bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies. \nTo Juno thus she speaks: \"Behold! It is done, \nThe blood already drawn, the war begun; \nThe discord is complete; nor can they cease \nThe dire debate, nor you command the peace. \nNow, since the Latian and the Trojan brood \nHave tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood; \nSpeak, and my pow'r shall add this office more: \nThe neighb'ing nations of th' Ausonian shore \nShall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar, \nOf arm'd invasion, and embrace the war.\" \nThen Juno thus: \"The grateful work is done, \nThe seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun; \nFrauds, fears, and fury have possess'd the state, \nAnd fix'd the causes of a lasting hate. \nA bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join \nBetwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line: \nBut thou with speed to night and hell repair; \nFor not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear \nThy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air. \nLeave what remains to me.\" Saturnia said: \nThe sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd, \nUnwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade. \nIn midst of Italy, well known to fame, \nThere lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name) \nBelow the lofty mounts: on either side \nThick forests the forbidden entrance hide. \nFull in the center of the sacred wood \nAn arm arises of the Stygian flood, \nWhich, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound, \nWhirls the black waves and rattling stones around. \nHere Pluto pants for breath from out his cell, \nAnd opens wide the grinning jaws of hell. \nTo this infernal lake the Fury flies; \nHere hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring skies.\n\nSaturnian Juno now, with double care, \nAttends the fatal process of the war. \nThe clowns, return'd, from battle bear the slain, \nImplore the gods, and to their king complain. \nThe corps of Almon and the rest are shown; \nShrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town. \nAmbitious Turnus in the press appears, \nAnd, aggravating crimes, augments their fears; \nProclaims his private injuries aloud, \nA solemn promise made, and disavow'd; \nA foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood. \nThen they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear, \nIn woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear, \nAnd lead his dances with dishevel'd hair, \nIncrease the clamor, and the war demand, \n(Such was Amata's interest in the land,) \nAgainst the public sanctions of the peace, \nAgainst all omens of their ill success. \nWith fates averse, the rout in arms resort, \nTo force their monarch, and insult the court. \nBut, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves \nThe raging tempest and the rising waves- \nPropp'd on himself he stands; his solid sides \nWash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides- \nSo stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long \nSustain'd the madness of the noisy throng. \nBut, when he found that Juno's pow'r prevail'd, \nAnd all the methods of cool counsel fail'd, \nHe calls the gods to witness their offense, \nDisclaims the war, asserts his innocence. \n\"Hurried by fate,\" he cries, \"and borne before \nA furious wind, we have the faithful shore. \nO more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear \nThe guilt of blood and sacrilegious war: \nThou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate, \nAnd pray to Heav'n for peace, but pray too late. \nFor me, my stormy voyage at an end, \nI to the port of death securely tend. \nThe fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay, \nIs all I want, and all you take away.\" \nHe said no more, but, in his walls confin'd, \nShut out the woes which he too well divin'd \nNor with the rising storm would vainly strive, \nBut left the helm, and let the vessel drive. \nA solemn custom was observ'd of old, \nWhich Latium held, and now the Romans hold, \nTheir standard when in fighting fields they rear \nAgainst the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare \nThe Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war; \nOr from the boasting Parthians would regain \nTheir eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain. \nTwo gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear, \nAnd still are worship'd with religious fear) \nBefore his temple stand: the dire abode, \nAnd the fear'd issues of the furious god, \nAre fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates, \nThe wary guardian Janus doubly waits. \nThen, when the sacred senate votes the wars, \nThe Roman consul their decree declares, \nAnd in his robes the sounding gates unbars. \nThe youth in military shouts arise, \nAnd the loud trumpets break the yielding skies. \nThese rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd, \nWere the king's office; but the king refus'd, \nDeaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar \nOf sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war; \nBut hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms, \nAbhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms. \nThen heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high: \nAt her approach the brazen hinges fly; \nThe gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar; \nAnd, like a tempest, issues out the war. \nThe peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore, \nLull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before, \nAre all on fire; and some, with studious care, \nTheir restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare; \nSome their soft limbs in painful marches try, \nAnd war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry. \nPart scour the rusty shields with seam; and part \nNew grind the blunted ax, and point the dart: \nWith joy they view the waving ensigns fly, \nAnd hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky. \nFive cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs, \nAntemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs, \nArdea the proud, the Crustumerian town: \nAll these of old were places of renown. \nSome hammer helmets for the fighting field; \nSome twine young sallows to support the shield; \nThe croslet some, and some the cuishes mold, \nWith silver plated, and with ductile gold. \nThe rustic honors of the scythe and share \nGive place to swords and plumes, the pride of war. \nOld fauchions are new temper'd in the fires; \nThe sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires. \nThe word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace \nThe shining headpiece, and the shield embrace. \nThe neighing steeds are to the chariot tied; \nThe trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side. \nAnd now the mighty labor is begun \nYe Muses, open all your Helicon. \nSing you the chiefs that sway'd th' Ausonian land, \nTheir arms, and armies under their command; \nWhat warriors in our ancient clime were bred; \nWhat soldiers follow'd, and what heroes led. \nFor well you know, and can record alone, \nWhat fame to future times conveys but darkly down. \nMezentius first appear'd upon the plain: \nScorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain, \nDefying earth and heav'n. Etruria lost, \nHe brings to Turnus' aid his baffled host. \nThe charming Lausus, full of youthful fire, \nRode in the rank, and next his sullen sire; \nTo Turnus only second in the grace \nOf manly mien, and features of the face. \nA skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred, \nWith fates averse a thousand men he led: \nHis sire unworthy of so brave a son; \nHimself well worthy of a happier throne. \nNext Aventinus drives his chariot round \nThe Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown'd. \nProud of his steeds, he smokes along the field; \nHis father's hydra fills his ample shield: \nA hundred serpents hiss about the brims; \nThe son of Hercules he justly seems \nBy his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs; \nOf heav'nly part, and part of earthly blood, \nA mortal woman mixing with a god. \nFor strong Alcides, after he had slain \nThe triple Geryon, drove from conquer'd Spain \nHis captive herds; and, thence in triumph led, \nOn Tuscan Tiber's flow'ry banks they fed. \nThen on Mount Aventine the son of Jove \nThe priestess Rhea found, and forc'd to love. \nFor arms, his men long piles and jav'lins bore; \nAnd poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore. \nLike Hercules himself his son appears, \nIn salvage pomp; a lion's hide he wears; \nAbout his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin; \nThe teeth and gaping jaws severely grin. \nThus, like the god his father, homely dress'd, \nHe strides into the hall, a horrid guest. \nThen two twin brothers from fair Tibur came, \n(Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,) \nFierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear: \nArm'd Argive horse they led, and in the front appear. \nLike cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's height \nWith rapid course descending to the fight; \nThey rush along; the rattling woods give way; \nThe branches bend before their sweepy sway. \nNor was Praeneste's founder wanting there, \nWhom fame reports the son of Mulciber: \nFound in the fire, and foster'd in the plains, \nA shepherd and a king at once he reigns, \nAnd leads to Turnus' aid his country swains. \nHis own Praeneste sends a chosen band, \nWith those who plow Saturnia's Gabine land; \nBesides the succor which cold Anien yields, \nThe rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields, \nAnagnia fat, and Father Amasene- \nA num'rous rout, but all of naked men: \nNor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield, \nNor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field, \nBut whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead, \nAnd spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head; \nThe left foot naked, when they march to fight, \nBut in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right. \nMessapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,) \nSecure of steel, and fated from the fire, \nIn pomp appears, and with his ardor warms \nA heartless train, unexercis'd in arms: \nThe just Faliscans he to battle brings, \nAnd those who live where Lake Ciminia springs; \nAnd where Feronia's grove and temple stands, \nWho till Fescennian or Flavinian lands. \nAll these in order march, and marching sing \nThe warlike actions of their sea-born king; \nLike a long team of snowy swans on high, \nWhich clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky, \nWhen, homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne, \nThey sing, and Asia's lakes their notes return. \nNot one who heard their music from afar, \nWould think these troops an army train'd to war, \nBut flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar, \nWith their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore. \nThen Clausus came, who led a num'rous band \nOf troops embodied from the Sabine land, \nAnd, in himself alone, an army brought. \n'T was he, the noble Claudian race begot, \nThe Claudian race, ordain'd, in times to come, \nTo share the greatness of imperial Rome. \nHe led the Cures forth, of old renown, \nMutuscans from their olive-bearing town, \nAnd all th' Eretian pow'rs; besides a band \nThat follow'd from Velinum's dewy land, \nAnd Amiternian troops, of mighty fame, \nAnd mountaineers, that from Severus came, \nAnd from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica, \nAnd those where yellow Tiber takes his way, \nAnd where Himella's wanton waters play. \nCasperia sends her arms, with those that lie \nBy Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli: \nThe warlike aids of Horta next appear, \nAnd the cold Nursians come to close the rear, \nMix'd with the natives born of Latine blood, \nWhom Allia washes with her fatal flood. \nNot thicker billows beat the Libyan main, \nWhen pale Orion sets in wintry rain; \nNor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise, \nOr Lycian fields, when Phoebus burns the skies, \nThan stand these troops: their bucklers ring around; \nTheir trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground.\n\nHigh in his chariot then Halesus came, \nA foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name: \nFrom Agamemnon born- to Turnus' aid \nA thousand men the youthful hero led, \nWho till the Massic soil, for wine renown'd, \nAnd fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground, \nAnd those who live by Sidicinian shores, \nAnd where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars, \nCales' and Osca's old inhabitants, \nAnd rough Saticulans, inur'd to wants: \nLight demi-lances from afar they throw, \nFasten'd with leathern thongs, to gall the foe. \nShort crooked swords in closer fight they wear; \nAnd on their warding arm light bucklers bear. \nNor Oebalus, shalt thou be left unsung, \nFrom nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung, \nWho then in Teleboan Capri reign'd; \nBut that short isle th' ambitious youth disdain'd, \nAnd o'er Campania stretch'd his ample sway, \nWhere swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea; \nO'er Batulum, and where Abella sees, \nFrom her high tow'rs, the harvest of her trees. \nAnd these (as was the Teuton use of old) \nWield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold; \nSling weighty stones, when from afar they fight; \nTheir casques are cork, a covering thick and light. \nNext these in rank, the warlike Ufens went, \nAnd led the mountain troops that Nursia sent. \nThe rude Equicolae his rule obey'd; \nHunting their sport, and plund'ring was their trade. \nIn arms they plow'd, to battle still prepar'd: \nTheir soil was barren, and their hearts were hard. \nUmbro the priest the proud Marrubians led, \nBy King Archippus sent to Turnus' aid, \nAnd peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head. \nHis wand and holy words, the viper's rage, \nAnd venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage. \nHe, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep \nTheir temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep. \nBut vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art, \nTo cure the wound giv'n by the Dardan dart: \nYet his untimely fate th' Angitian woods \nIn sighs remurmur'd to the Fucine floods. \nThe son of fam'd Hippolytus was there, \nFam'd as his sire, and, as his mother, fair; \nWhom in Egerian groves Aricia bore, \nAnd nurs'd his youth along the marshy shore, \nWhere great Diana's peaceful altars flame, \nIn fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name. \nHippolytus, as old records have said, \nWas by his stepdam sought to share her bed; \nBut, when no female arts his mind could move, \nShe turn'd to furious hate her impious love. \nTorn by wild horses on the sandy shore, \nAnother's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore, \nGlutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore. \nBut chaste Diana, who his death deplor'd, \nWith Aesculapian herbs his life restor'd. \nThen Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain, \nThe dead inspir'd with vital breath again, \nStruck to the center, with his flaming dart, \nTh' unhappy founder of the godlike art. \nBut Trivia kept in secret shades alone \nHer care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown; \nAnd call'd him Virbius in th' Egerian grove, \nWhere then he liv'd obscure, but safe from Jove. \nFor this, from Trivia's temple and her wood \nAre coursers driv'n, who shed their master's blood, \nAffrighted by the monsters of the flood. \nHis son, the second Virbius, yet retain'd \nHis father's art, and warrior steeds he rein'd. \nAmid the troops, and like the leading god, \nHigh o'er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode: \nA triple of plumes his crest adorn'd, \nOn which with belching flames Chimaera burn'd: \nThe more the kindled combat rises high'r, \nThe more with fury burns the blazing fire. \nFair Io grac'd his shield; but Io now \nWith horns exalted stands, and seems to low- \nA noble charge! Her keeper by her side, \nTo watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied; \nAnd on the brims her sire, the wat'ry god, \nRoll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood. \nA cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields \nWith swords, and pointed spears, and clatt'ring shields;\n\nOf Argives, and of old Sicanian bands, \nAnd those who plow the rich Rutulian lands; \nAuruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields, \nAnd the proud Labicans, with painted shields, \nAnd those who near Numician streams reside, \nAnd those whom Tiber's holy forests hide, \nOr Circe's hills from the main land divide; \nWhere Ufens glides along the lowly lands, \nOr the black water of Pomptina stands. \nLast, from the Volscians fair Camilla came, \nAnd led her warlike troops, a warrior dame; \nUnbred to spinning, in the loom unskill'd, \nShe chose the nobler Pallas of the field. \nMix'd with the first, the fierce virago fought, \nSustain'd the toils of arms, the danger sought, \nOutstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain, \nFlew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain: \nShe swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along, \nHer flying feet unbath'd on billows hung. \nMen, boys, and women, stupid with surprise, \nWhere'er she passes, fix their wond'ring eyes: \nLonging they look, and, gaping at the sight, \nDevour her o'er and o'er with vast delight; \nHer purple habit sits with such a grace \nOn her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face; \nHer head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd, \nAnd in a golden caul the curls are bound. \nShe shakes her myrtle jav'lin; and, behind, \nHer Lycian quiver dances in the wind. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VIII\n\nWhen Turnus had assembled all his pow'rs, \nHis standard planted on Laurentum's tow'rs; \nWhen now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, \nHad giv'n the signal of approaching war, \nHad rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields, \nWhile the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields; \nTrembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare \nTo join th' allies, and headlong rush to war. \nFierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, \nWith bold Mezentius, who blasphem'd aloud. \nThese thro' the country took their wasteful course, \nThe fields to forage, and to gather force. \nThen Venulus to Diomede they send, \nTo beg his aid Ausonia to defend, \nDeclare the common danger, and inform \nThe Grecian leader of the growing storm: \nAeneas, landed on the Latian coast, \nWith banish'd gods, and with a baffled host, \nYet now aspir'd to conquest of the state, \nAnd claim'd a title from the gods and fate; \nWhat num'rous nations in his quarrel came, \nAnd how they spread his formidable name. \nWhat he design'd, what mischief might arise, \nIf fortune favor'd his first enterprise, \nWas left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, \nAnd common interest, was involv'd in theirs. \nWhile Turnus and th' allies thus urge the war, \nThe Trojan, floating in a flood of care, \nBeholds the tempest which his foes prepare. \nThis way and that he turns his anxious mind; \nThinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd; \nExplores himself in vain, in ev'ry part, \nAnd gives no rest to his distracted heart. \nSo, when the sun by day, or moon by night, \nStrike on the polish'd brass their trembling light, \nThe glitt'ring species here and there divide, \nAnd cast their dubious beams from side to side; \nNow on the walls, now on the pavement play, \nAnd to the ceiling flash the glaring day. \n'T was night; and weary nature lull'd asleep \nThe birds of air, and fishes of the deep, \nAnd beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief \nWas laid on Tiber's banks, oppress'd with grief, \nAnd found in silent slumber late relief. \nThen, thro' the shadows of the poplar wood, \nArose the father of the Roman flood; \nAn azure robe was o'er his body spread, \nA wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head: \nThus, manifest to sight, the god appear'd, \nAnd with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer'd: \n\"Undoubted offspring of ethereal race, \nO long expected in this promis'd place! \nWho thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods, \nRestor'd them to their hearths, and old abodes; \nThis is thy happy home, the clime where fate \nOrdains thee to restore the Trojan state. \nFear not! The war shall end in lasting peace, \nAnd all the rage of haughty Juno cease. \nAnd that this nightly vision may not seem \nTh' effect of fancy, or an idle dream, \nA sow beneath an oak shall lie along, \nAll white herself, and white her thirty young. \nWhen thirty rolling years have run their race, \nThy son Ascanius, on this empty space, \nShall build a royal town, of lasting fame, \nWhich from this omen shall receive the name. \nTime shall approve the truth. For what remains, \nAnd how with sure success to crown thy pains, \nWith patience next attend. A banish'd band, \nDriv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land, \nHave planted here, and plac'd on high their walls; \nTheir town the founder Pallanteum calls, \nDeriv'd from Pallas, his great-grandsire's name: \nBut the fierce Latians old possession claim, \nWith war infesting the new colony. \nThese make thy friends, and on their aid rely. \nTo thy free passage I submit my streams. \nWake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams; \nAnd, when the setting stars are lost in day, \nTo Juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay; \nWith sacrifice the wrathful queen appease: \nHer pride at length shall fall, her fury cease. \nWhen thou return'st victorious from the war, \nPerform thy vows to me with grateful care. \nThe god am I, whose yellow water flows \nAround these fields, and fattens as it goes: \nTiber my name; among the rolling floods \nRenown'd on earth, esteem'd among the gods. \nThis is my certain seat. In times to come, \nMy waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome.\" \nHe said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke, \nHis dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook. \nHe rose, and looking up, beheld the skies \nWith purple blushing, and the day arise. \nThen water in his hollow palm he took \nFrom Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke: \n\"Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed, \nAnd Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed \nReceive Aeneas, and from danger keep. \nWhatever fount, whatever holy deep, \nConceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they rise, \nAnd, bubbling from below, salute the skies; \nThou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn \nSuffices fatness to the fruitful corn, \nFor this thy kind compassion of our woes, \nShalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows. \nBut, O be present to thy people's aid, \nAnd firm the gracious promise thou hast made!\" \nThus having said, two galleys from his stores, \nWith care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars. \nNow on the shore the fatal swine is found. \nWondrous to tell!- She lay along the ground: \nHer well-fed offspring at her udders hung; \nShe white herself, and white her thirty young. \nAeneas takes the mother and her brood, \nAnd all on Juno's altar are bestow'd. \nThe foll'wing night, and the succeeding day, \nPropitious Tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way: \nHe roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood, \nA gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood. \nThe Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore, \nBorne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. \nShouts from the land give omen to their course, \nAnd the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force. \nThe woods and waters wonder at the gleam \nOf shields, and painted ships that stem the stream. \nOne summer's night and one whole day they pass \nBetwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass. \nThe fiery sun had finish'd half his race, \nLook'd back, and doubted in the middle space, \nWhen they from far beheld the rising tow'rs, \nThe tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs, \nThin as they stood, which, then of homely clay, \nNow rise in marble, from the Roman sway. \nThese cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor) \nThe Trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore. \n'T was on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states, \nThe king and prince, without the city gates, \nThen paid their off'rings in a sacred grove \nTo Hercules, the warrior son of Jove. \nThick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies, \nAnd fat of entrails on his altar fries. \nBut, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood, \nAnd glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood, \nThey rose with fear, and left th' unfinish'd feast, \nTill dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest \nTo pay the rites. Himself without delay \nA jav'lin seiz'd, and singly took his way; \nThen gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far: \n\"Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are; \nYour bus'ness here; and bring you peace or war?\" \nHigh on the stern Aeneas his stand, \nAnd held a branch of olive in his hand, \nWhile thus he spoke: \"The Phrygians' arms you see, \nExpell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy \nBy Latian foes, with war unjustly made; \nAt first affianc'd, and at last betray'd. \nThis message bear: 'The Trojans and their chief \nBring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.' \nStruck with so great a name, and all on fire, \nThe youth replies: \"Whatever you require, \nYour fame exacts. Upon our shores descend. \nA welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend.\" \nHe said, and, downward hasting to the strand, \nEmbrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand. \nConducted to the grove, Aeneas broke \nThe silence first, and thus the king bespoke: \n\"Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate's command, \nI bear these peaceful branches in my hand, \nUndaunted I approach you, tho' I know \nYour birth is Grecian, and your land my foe; \nFrom Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came, \nAnd both the brother kings your kindred claim; \nYet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown, \nYour virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown, \nOur fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice, \nHave led me hither, less by need than choice. \nOur founder Dardanus, as fame has sung, \nAnd Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung: \nElectra from the loins of Atlas came; \nAtlas, whose head sustains the starry frame. \nYour sire is Mercury, whom long before \nOn cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore. \nMaia the fair, on fame if we rely, \nWas Atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky. \nThus from one common source our streams divide; \nOurs is the Trojan, yours th' Areadian side. \nRais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before, \nNor ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore; \nBut come, without a pledge, my own ambassador. \nThe same Rutulians, who with arms pursue \nThe Trojan race, are equal foes to you. \nOur host expell'd, what farther force can stay \nThe victor troops from universal sway? \nThen will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land, \nAnd either sea from side to side command. \nReceive our offer'd faith, and give us thine; \nOurs is a gen'rous and experienc'd line: \nWe want not hearts nor bodies for the war; \nIn council cautious, and in fields we dare.\" \nHe said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes \nEvander view'd the man with vast surprise, \nPleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face: \nThen answer'd briefly, with a royal grace: \n\"O valiant leader of the Trojan line, \nIn whom the features of thy father shine, \nHow I recall Anchises! how I see \nHis motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee! \nLong tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind, \nWhen Priam to his sister's court design'd \nA welcome visit, with a friendly stay, \nAnd thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way. \nThen, past a boy, the callow down began \nTo shade my chin, and call me first a man. \nI saw the shining train with vast delight, \nAnd Priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight: \nBut great Anchises, far above the rest, \nWith awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast. \nI long'd to join in friendship's holy bands \nOur mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands. \nI first accosted him: I sued, I sought, \nAnd, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought. \nHe gave me, when at length constrain'd to go, \nA Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow, \nA vest embroider'd, glorious to behold, \nAnd two rich bridles, with their bits of gold, \nWhich my son's coursers in obedience hold. \nThe league you ask, I offer, as your right; \nAnd, when to-morrow's sun reveals the light, \nWith swift supplies you shall be sent away. \nNow celebrate with us this solemn day, \nWhose holy rites admit no long delay. \nHonor our annual feast; and take your seat, \nWith friendly welcome, at a homely treat.\" \nThus having said, the bowls (remov'd for fear) \nThe youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer. \nOn sods of turf he set the soldiers round: \nA maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground, \nReceiv'd the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed, \nA lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread. \nThe loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine \nIn bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine: \nBroil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.\n\nBut when the rage of hunger was repress'd, \nThus spoke Evander to his royal guest: \n\"These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king, \nFrom no vain fears or superstition spring, \nOr blind devotion, or from blinder chance, \nOr heady zeal, or brutal ignorance; \nBut, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense, \nThe labors of a god we recompense. \nSee, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky, \nAbout whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie; \nSuch indigested ruin; bleak and bare, \nHow desart now it stands, expos'd in air! \n'T was once a robber's den, inclos'd around \nWith living stone, and deep beneath the ground. \nThe monster Cacus, more than half a beast, \nThis hold, impervious to the sun, possess'd. \nThe pavement ever foul with human gore; \nHeads, and their mangled members, hung the door. \nVulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire, \nBlack clouds he belch'd, and flakes of livid fire. \nTime, long expected, eas'd us of our load, \nAnd brought the needful presence of a god. \nTh' avenging force of Hercules, from Spain, \nArriv'd in triumph, from Geryon slain: \nThrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain. \nHis prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove \nNear Tiber's bank, to graze the shady grove. \nAllur'd with hope of plunder, and intent \nBy force to rob, by fraud to circumvent, \nThe brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray'd, \nFour oxen thence, and four fair kine convey'd; \nAnd, lest the printed footsteps might be seen, \nHe dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den. \nThe tracks averse a lying notice gave, \nAnd led the searcher backward from the cave. \n\"Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place, \nTo find fresh pasture and untrodden grass. \nThe beasts, who miss'd their mates, fill'd all around \nWith bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the sound. \nOne heifer, who had heard her love complain, \nRoar'd from the cave, and made the project vain. \nAlcides found the fraud; with rage he shook, \nAnd toss'd about his head his knotted oak. \nSwift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight, \nHe clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial height. \nThen first we saw the monster mend his pace; \nFear his eyes, and paleness in his face, \nConfess'd the god's approach. Trembling he springs, \nAs terror had increas'd his feet with wings; \nNor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw \nHis body, on his back the door he drew \n(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains \nHis father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains): \nHe broke the heavy links, the mountain clos'd, \nAnd bars and levers to his foe oppos'd. \nThe wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast; \nThe fierce avenger came with bounding haste; \nSurvey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold, \nAnd here and there his raging eyes he roll'd. \nHe gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round \nWith winged speed the circuit of the ground. \nThrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in vain, \nAnd, panting, thrice desisted from his pain. \nA pointed flinty rock, all bare and black, \nGrew gibbous from behind the mountain's back; \nOwls, ravens, all ill omens of the night, \nHere built their nests, and hither wing'd their flight. \nThe leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood, \nAnd nodded to the left. The hero stood \nAdverse, with planted feet, and, from the right, \nTugg'd at the solid stone with all his might. \nThus heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock \nGave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock. \nTumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side \nThe banks leap backward, and the streams divide; \nThe sky shrunk upward with unusual dread, \nAnd trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed. \nThe court of Cacus stands reveal'd to sight; \nThe cavern glares with new-admitted light. \nSo the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound, \nHeave from below, and rend the hollow ground; \nA sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high, \nThe gods with hate beheld the nether sky: \nThe ghosts repine at violated night, \nAnd curse th' invading sun, and sicken at the sight. \nThe graceless monster, caught in open day, \nInclos'd, and in despair to fly away, \nHowls horrible from underneath, and fills \nHis hollow palace with unmanly yells. \nThe hero stands above, and from afar \nPlies him with darts, and stones, and distant war. \nHe, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires \nBlack clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires, \nGath'ring, with each repeated blast, the night, \nTo make uncertain aim, and erring sight. \nThe wrathful god then plunges from above, \nAnd, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove, \nThere lights; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his way,\n\nHalf sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey. \nThe monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found; \nHe squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around, \nAnd in a knot his crippled members bound; \nThen from their sockets tore his burning eyes: \nRoll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies. \nThe doors, unbarr'd, receive the rushing day, \nAnd thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey. \nThe bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again. \nNext, by the feet, they drag him from his den. \nThe wond'ring neighborhood, with glad surprise, \nBehold his shagged breast, his giant size, \nHis mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd eyes.\n\nFrom that auspicious day, with rites divine, \nWe worship at the hero's holy shrine. \nPotitius first ordain'd these annual vows: \nAs priests, were added the Pinarian house, \nWho rais'd this altar in the sacred shade, \nWhere honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid. \nFor these deserts, and this high virtue shown, \nYe warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown: \nFill high the goblets with a sparkling flood, \nAnd with deep draughts invoke our common god.\" \nThis said, a double wreath Evander twin'd, \nAnd poplars black and white his temples bind. \nThen brims his ample bowl. With like design \nThe rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine. \nMeantime the sun descended from the skies, \nAnd the bright evening star began to rise. \nAnd now the priests, Potitius at their head, \nIn skins of beasts involv'd, the long procession led; \nHeld high the flaming tapers in their hands, \nAs custom had prescrib'd their holy bands; \nThen with a second course the tables load, \nAnd with full chargers offer to the god. \nThe Salii sing, and cense his altars round \nWith Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound- \nOne choir of old, another of the young, \nTo dance, and bear the burthen of the song. \nThe lay records the labors, and the praise, \nAnd all th' immortal acts of Hercules: \nFirst, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands, \nThe serpents strangled with his infant hands; \nThen, as in years and matchless force he grew, \nTh' Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew. \nBesides, a thousand hazards they relate, \nProcur'd by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate: \n\"Thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue \nThe cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew: \nNor thy resistless arm the bull withstood, \nNor he, the roaring terror of the wood. \nThe triple porter of the Stygian seat, \nWith lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet, \nAnd, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat. \nTh' infernal waters trembled at thy sight; \nThee, god, no face of danger could affright; \nNot huge Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake, \nIncreas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake. \nHail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace \nTo heav'n and the great author of thy race! \nReceive the grateful off'rings which we pay, \nAnd smile propitious on thy solemn day!\" \nIn numbers thus they sung; above the rest, \nThe den and death of Cacus crown the feast. \nThe woods to hollow vales convey the sound, \nThe vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound. \nThe rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire. \nBetwixt young Pallas and his aged sire, \nThe Trojan pass'd, the city to survey, \nAnd pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way. \nThe stranger cast around his curious eyes, \nNew objects viewing still, with new surprise; \nWith greedy joy enquires of various things, \nAnd acts and monuments of ancient kings. \nThen thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs: \n\"These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs, \nOf Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took \nTheir birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak. \nNor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care \nOf lab'ring oxen, or the shining share, \nNor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare. \nTheir exercise the chase; the running flood \nSupplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food. \nThen Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove, \nRobb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above. \nThe men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought, \nAnd laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught, \nAnd Latium call'd the land where safe he lay \nFrom his unduteous son, and his usurping sway. \nWith his mild empire, peace and plenty came; \nAnd hence the golden times deriv'd their name. \nA more degenerate and discolor'd age \nSucceeded this, with avarice and rage. \nTh' Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came; \nAnd Saturn's empire often chang'd the name. \nThen kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest, \nWith arbitrary sway the land oppress'd: \nFor Tiber's flood was Albula before, \nTill, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore. \nI last arriv'd, driv'n from my native home \nBy fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom. \nLong toss'd on seas, I sought this happy land, \nWarn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's command.\"\n\nThus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate, \nSince call'd Carmental by the Roman state; \nWhere stood an altar, sacred to the name \nOf old Carmenta, the prophetic dame, \nWho to her son foretold th' Aenean race, \nSublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place: \nThen shews the forest, which, in after times, \nFierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes \nA sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine \nWhere Pan below the rock had rites divine: \nThen tells of Argus' death, his murder'd guest, \nWhose grave and tomb his innocence attest. \nThence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads; \nNow roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely reeds. \nA reverent fear (such superstition reigns \nAmong the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains. \nSome god, they knew- what god, they could not tell- \nDid there amidst the sacred horror dwell. \nTh' Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw \nThe mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe, \nWho took his shield, and dealt his bolts around, \nAnd scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground. \nThen saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood \nTwo stately towns, on either side the flood,) \nSaturnia's and Janicula's remains; \nAnd either place the founder's name retains. \nDiscoursing thus together, they resort \nWhere poor Evander kept his country court. \nThey view'd the ground of Rome's litigious hall; \n(Once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;) \nThen, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd, \nWhen thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest: \n\"Mean as it is, this palace, and this door, \nReceiv'd Alcides, then a conqueror. \nDare to be poor; accept our homely food, \nWhich feasted him, and emulate a god.\" \nThen underneath a lowly roof he led \nThe weary prince, and laid him on a bed; \nThe stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread. \nNow Night had shed her silver dews around, \nAnd with her sable wings embrac'd the ground, \nWhen love's fair goddess, anxious for her son, \n(New tumults rising, and new wars begun,) \nCouch'd with her husband in his golden bed, \nWith these alluring words invokes his aid; \nAnd, that her pleasing speech his mind may move, \nInspires each accent with the charms of love: \n\"While cruel fate conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs, \nTo level with the ground the Trojan tow'rs, \nI ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore, \nNor did the succor of thy skill implore; \nNor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain, \nA sinking empire longer to sustain, \nTho'much I ow'd to Priam's house, and more \nThe dangers of Aeneas did deplore. \nBut now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree, \nHis race is doom'd to reign in Italy: \nWith humble suit I beg thy needful art, \nO still propitious pow'r, that rules my heart! \nA mother kneels a suppliant for her son. \nBy Thetis and Aurora thou wert won \nTo forge impenetrable shields, and grace \nWith fated arms a less illustrious race. \nBehold, what haughty nations are combin'd \nAgainst the relics of the Phrygian kind, \nWith fire and sword my people to destroy, \nAnd conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy.\" \nShe said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue, \nAbout her unresolving husband threw. \nHer soft embraces soon infuse desire; \nHis bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire; \nAnd all the godhead feels the wonted fire. \nNot half so swift the rattling thunder flies, \nOr forky lightnings flash along the skies. \nThe goddess, proud of her successful wiles, \nAnd conscious of her form, in secret smiles. \nThen thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms, \nPanting, and half dissolving in her arms: \n\"Why seek you reasons for a cause so just, \nOr your own beauties or my love distrust? \nLong since, had you requir'd my helpful hand, \nTh' artificer and art you might command, \nTo labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate, \nConfin'd their empire to so short a date. \nAnd, if you now desire new wars to wage, \nMy skill I promise, and my pains engage. \nWhatever melting metals can conspire, \nOr breathing bellows, or the forming fire, \nIs freely yours: your anxious fears remove, \nAnd think no task is difficult to love.\" \nTrembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms, \nHe snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms; \nTill in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd \nOf full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest. \nNow when the Night her middle race had rode, \nAnd his first slumber had refresh'd the god- \nThe time when early housewives leave the bed; \nWhen living embers on the hearth they spread, \nSupply the lamp, and call the maids to rise- \nWith yawning mouths, and with half-open'd eyes, \nThey ply the distaff by the winking light, \nAnd to their daily labor add the night: \nThus frugally they earn their children's bread, \nAnd uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed- \nNot less concern'd, nor at a later hour, \nRose from his downy couch the forging pow'r. \nSacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay, \nBetwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare, \nRais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below, \nIn hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow. \nThe Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal; \nLoud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel, \nAre heard around; the boiling waters roar, \nAnd smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar. \nHether the Father of the Fire, by night, \nThro' the brown air precipitates his flight. \nOn their eternal anvils here he found \nThe brethren beating, and the blows go round. \nA load of pointless thunder now there lies \nBefore their hands, to ripen for the skies: \nThese darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast; \nConsum'd on mortals with prodigious waste. \nThree rays of writhen rain, of fire three more, \nOf winged southern winds and cloudy store \nAs many parts, the dreadful mixture frame; \nAnd fears are added, and avenging flame. \nInferior ministers, for Mars, repair \nHis broken axletrees and blunted war, \nAnd send him forth again with furbish'd arms, \nTo wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms. \nThe rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold \nThe shield of Pallas, and renew their gold. \nFull on the crest the Gorgon's head they place, \nWith eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face. \n\"My sons,\" said Vulcan, \"set your tasks aside; \nYour strength and master-skill must now be tried. \nArms for a hero forge; arms that require \nYour force, your speed, and all your forming fire.\" \nHe said. They set their former work aside, \nAnd their new toils with eager haste divide. \nA flood of molten silver, brass, and gold, \nAnd deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd; \nOf this, their artful hands a shield prepare, \nAlone sufficient to sustain the war. \nSev'n orbs within a spacious round they close: \nOne stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows. \nThe hissing steel is in the smithy drown'd; \nThe grot with beaten anvils groans around. \nBy turns their arms advance, in equal time; \nBy turns their hands descend, and hammers chime. \nThey turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs; \nThe fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs. \nWhile, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge \nTheir labors thus, and ply th' Aeolian forge, \nThe cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes, \nAnd songs of chirping birds invite to rise. \nHe leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet \nAbove his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet: \nHe sets his trusty sword upon his side, \nAnd o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide. \nTwo menial dogs before their master press'd. \nThus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest. \nMindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace, \nBut meets Aeneas in the middle space. \nYoung Pallas did his father's steps attend, \nAnd true Achates waited on his friend. \nThey join their hands; a secret seat they choose; \nTh' Arcadian first their former talk renews: \n\"Undaunted prince, I never can believe \nThe Trojan empire lost, while you survive. \nCommand th' assistance of a faithful friend; \nBut feeble are the succors I can send. \nOur narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds; \nThat other side the Latian state surrounds, \nInsults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds. \nBut mighty nations I prepare, to join \nTheir arms with yours, and aid your just design. \nYou come, as by your better genius sent, \nAnd fortune seems to favor your intent. \nNot far from hence there stands a hilly town, \nOf ancient building, and of high renown, \nTorn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race, \nWho gave the name of Caere to the place, \nOnce Agyllina call'd. It flourish'd long, \nIn pride of wealth and warlike people strong, \nTill curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal hour, \nAssum'd the crown, with arbitrary pow'r. \nWhat words can paint those execrable times, \nThe subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes! \nThat blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace \nOn his own head, and on his impious race! \nThe living and the dead at his command \nWere coupled, face to face, and hand to hand, \nTill, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied, \nThe ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died. \nThus plung'd in ills, and meditating more- \nThe people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore \nThe raging monster; but with arms beset \nHis house, and vengeance and destruction threat. \nThey fire his palace: while the flame ascends, \nThey force his guards, and execute his friends. \nHe cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night, \nTo Turnus' friendly court directs his flight. \nBy just revenge the Tuscans set on fire, \nWith arms, their king to punishment require: \nTheir num'rous troops, now muster'd on the strand, \nMy counsel shall submit to your command. \nTheir navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry \nTo hoist their anchors, but the gods deny. \nAn ancient augur, skill'd in future fate, \nWith these foreboding words restrains their hate: \n'Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r \nOf Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow'r, \nWhom just revenge against Mezentius arms, \nTo seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms; \nKnow this: no native of our land may lead \nThis pow'rful people; seek a foreign head.' \nAw'd with these words, in camps they still abide, \nAnd wait with longing looks their promis'd guide. \nTarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent \nTheir crown, and ev'ry regal ornament: \nThe people join their own with his desire; \nAnd all my conduct, as their king, require. \nBut the chill blood that creeps within my veins, \nAnd age, and listless limbs unfit for pains, \nAnd a soul conscious of its own decay, \nHave forc'd me to refuse imperial sway. \nMy Pallas were more fit to mount the throne, \nAnd should, but he's a Sabine mother's son, \nAnd half a native; but, in you, combine \nA manly vigor, and a foreign line. \nWhere Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way, \nPursue the ready path to sov'reign sway. \nThe staff of my declining days, my son, \nShall make your good or ill success his own; \nIn fighting fields from you shall learn to dare, \nAnd serve the hard apprenticeship of war; \nYour matchless courage and your conduct view, \nAnd early shall begin t' admire and copy you. \nBesides, two hundred horse he shall command; \nTho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band. \nThese in my name are listed; and my son \nAs many more has added in his own.\" \nScarce had he said; Achates and his guest, \nWith downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd; \nWho, short of succors, and in deep despair, \nShook at the dismal prospect of the war. \nBut his bright mother, from a breaking cloud, \nTo cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud; \nThrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky, \nAnd Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high. \nThen, gazing up, repeated peals they hear; \nAnd, in a heav'n serene, refulgent arms appear: \nRedd'ning the skies, and glitt'ring all around, \nThe temper'd metals clash, and yield a silver sound. \nThe rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine; \nAeneas only, conscious to the sign, \nPresag'd th' event, and joyful view'd, above, \nTh' accomplish'd promise of the Queen of Love. \nThen, to th' Arcadian king: \"This prodigy \n(Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me. \nHeav'n calls me to the war: th' expected sign \nIs giv'n of promis'd aid, and arms divine. \nMy goddess mother, whose indulgent care \nForesaw the dangers of the growing war, \nThis omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms, \nFated from force of steel by Stygian charms, \nSuspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd \nApproaching fights, and fields to float in blood. \nTurnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn; \nAnd corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne, \nShall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms; \nAnd, Latian troops, prepare your perjur'd arms.\" \nHe said, and, rising from his homely throne, \nThe solemn rites of Hercules begun, \nAnd on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires; \nThen cheerful to his household gods retires; \nThere offers chosen sheep. Th' Arcadian king \nAnd Trojan youth the same oblations bring. \nNext, of his men and ships he makes review; \nDraws out the best and ablest of the crew. \nDown with the falling stream the refuse run, \nTo raise with joyful news his drooping son. \nSteeds are prepar'd to mount the Trojan band, \nWho wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land. \nA sprightly courser, fairer than the rest, \nThe king himself presents his royal guest: \nA lion's hide his back and limbs infold, \nPrecious with studded work, and paws of gold. \nFame thro' the little city spreads aloud \nTh' intended march, amid the fearful crowd: \nThe matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears, \nAnd double their devotion in their fears. \nThe war at hand appears with more affright, \nAnd rises ev'ry moment to the sight. \nThen old Evander, with a close embrace, \nStrain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face.\n\n\"Would Heav'n,\" said he, \"my strength and youth recall, \nSuch as I was beneath Praeneste's wall; \nThen when I made the foremost foes retire, \nAnd set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire; \nWhen Herilus in single fight I slew, \nWhom with three lives Feronia did endue; \nAnd thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore, \nTill the last ebbing soul return'd no more- \nSuch if I stood renew'd, not these alarms, \nNor death, should rend me from my Pallas' arms; \nNor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish'd, boast \nHis rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast. \nYe gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring \nRelief, and hear a father and a king! \nIf fate and you reserve these eyes, to see \nMy son return with peace and victory; \nIf the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight; \nIf we shall meet again with more delight; \nThen draw my life in length; let me sustain, \nIn hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain. \nBut if your hard decrees- which, O! I dread- \nHave doom'd to death his undeserving head; \nThis, O this very moment, let me die! \nWhile hopes and fears in equal balance lie; \nWhile, yet possess'd of all his youthful charms, \nI strain him close within these aged arms; \nBefore that fatal news my soul shall wound!\" \nHe said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground. \nHis servants bore him off, and softly laid \nHis languish'd limbs upon his homely bed. \nThe horsemen march; the gates are open'd wide; \nAeneas at their head, Achates by his side. \nNext these, the Trojan leaders rode along; \nLast follows in the rear th' Arcadian throng. \nYoung Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest; \nGilded his arms, embroider'd was his vest. \nSo, from the seas, exerts his radiant head \nThe star by whom the lights of heav'n are led; \nShakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews, \nDispels the darkness, and the day renews. \nThe trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd, \nAnd follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud, \nWhich winds disperse by fits, and shew from far \nThe blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war. \nThe troops, drawn up in beautiful array, \nO'er heathy plains pursue the ready way. \nRepeated peals of shouts are heard around; \nThe neighing coursers answer to the sound, \nAnd shake with horny hoofs the solid ground. \nA greenwood shade, for long religion known, \nStands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town, \nIncompass'd round with gloomy hills above, \nWhich add a holy horror to the grove. \nThe first inhabitants of Grecian blood, \nThat sacred forest to Silvanus vow'd, \nThe guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay \nTheir due devotions on his annual day. \nNot far from hence, along the river's side, \nIn tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide, \nBy Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground, \nAeneas cast his wond'ring eyes around, \nAnd all the Tyrrhene army had in sight, \nStretch'd on the spacious plain from left to right. \nThether his warlike train the Trojan led, \nRefresh'd his men, and wearied horses fed. \nMeantime the mother goddess, crown'd with charms, \nBreaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated arms. \nWithin a winding vale she finds her son, \nOn the cool river's banks, retir'd alone. \nShe shews her heav'nly form without disguise, \nAnd gives herself to his desiring eyes. \n\"Behold,\" she said, \"perform'd in ev'ry part, \nMy promise made, and Vulcan's labor'd art. \nNow seek, secure, the Latian enemy, \nAnd haughty Turnus to the field defy.\" \nShe said; and, having first her son embrac'd, \nThe radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd, \nProud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight \nAround the work, and gaz'd with vast delight. \nHe lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires \nThe crested helm, that vomits radiant fires: \nHis hands the fatal sword and corslet hold, \nOne keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold: \nBoth ample, flaming both, and beamy bright; \nSo shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse light. \nHe shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try \nThe plated cuishes on his manly thigh; \nBut most admires the shield's mysterious mold, \nAnd Roman triumphs rising on the gold: \nFor these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought \n(Not in the rolls of future fate untaught) \nThe wars in order, and the race divine \nOf warriors issuing from the Julian line. \nThe cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens: \nThere, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins. \nIntrepid on her swelling dugs they hung; \nThe foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue: \nThey suck'd secure, while, bending back her head, \nShe lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them as they fed.\n\nNot far from thence new Rome appears, with games \nProjected for the rape of Sabine dames. \nThe pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds, \nFor breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds. \nHere for revenge the Sabine troops contend; \nThe Romans there with arms the prey defend. \nWearied with tedious war, at length they cease; \nAnd both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace. \nThe friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand, \nBoth arm'd, with each a charger in his hand: \nA fatted sow for sacrifice is led, \nWith imprecations on the perjur'd head. \nNear this, the traitor Metius, stretch'd between \nFour fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green, \nBy Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood, \nAnd his torn limbs are left the vulture's food. \nThere, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings, \nAnd would by force restore the banish'd kings. \nOne tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights; \nThe Roman youth assert their native rights. \nBefore the town the Tuscan army lies, \nTo win by famine, or by fraud surprise. \nTheir king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood, \nWhile Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood. \nThe captive maids there tempt the raging tide, \nScap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide. \nHigh on a rock heroic Manlius stood, \nTo guard the temple, and the temple's god. \nThen Rome was poor; and there you might behold \nThe palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with gold. \nThe silver goose before the shining gate \nThere flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state. \nShe told the Gauls' approach; th' approaching Gauls, \nObscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls. \nThe gold dissembled well their yellow hair, \nAnd golden chains on their white necks they wear. \nGold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield, \nAnd their left arm sustains a length of shield. \nHard by, the leaping Salian priests advance; \nAnd naked thro' the streets the mad Luperci dance, \nIn caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n. \nHere modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n, \nTo pay their vows in solemn pomp appear, \nAnd odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear. \nFar hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen; \nPains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline \nHung on a rock- the traitor; and, around, \nThe Furies hissing from the nether ground. \nApart from these, the happy souls he draws, \nAnd Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws. \nBetwixt the quarters flows a golden sea; \nBut foaming surges there in silver play. \nThe dancing dolphins with their tails divide \nThe glitt'ring waves, and cut the precious tide. \nAmid the main, two mighty fleets engage \nTheir brazen beaks, oppos'd with equal rage. \nActium surveys the well-disputed prize; \nLeucate's wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries. \nYoung Caesar, on the stern, in armor bright, \nHere leads the Romans and their gods to fight: \nHis beamy temples shoot their flames afar, \nAnd o'er his head is hung the Julian star. \nAgrippa seconds him, with prosp'rous gales, \nAnd, with propitious gods, his foes assails: \nA naval crown, that binds his manly brows, \nThe happy fortune of the fight foreshows. \nRang'd on the line oppos'd, Antonius brings \nBarbarian aids, and troops of Eastern kings; \nTh' Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar, \nOf tongues discordant, and a mingled war: \nAnd, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife, \nHis ill fate follows him- th' Egyptian wife. \nMoving they fight; with oars and forky prows \nThe froth is gather'd, and the water glows. \nIt seems, as if the Cyclades again \nWere rooted up, and justled in the main; \nOr floating mountains floating mountains meet; \nSuch is the fierce encounter of the fleet. \nFireballs are thrown, and pointed jav'lins fly; \nThe fields of Neptune take a purple dye. \nThe queen herself, amidst the loud alarms, \nWith cymbals toss'd her fainting soldiers warms- \nFool as she was! who had not yet divin'd \nHer cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind. \nHer country gods, the monsters of the sky, \nGreat Neptune, Pallas, and Love's Queen defy: \nThe dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain, \nNor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train. \nMars in the middle of the shining shield \nIs grav'd, and strides along the liquid field. \nThe Dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent; \nAnd Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent, \nDivides the prease: her steps Bellona treads, \nAnd shakes her iron rod above their heads. \nThis seen, Apollo, from his Actian height, \nPours down his arrows; at whose winged flight \nThe trembling Indians and Egyptians yield, \nAnd soft Sabaeans quit the wat'ry field. \nThe fatal mistress hoists her silken sails, \nAnd, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales. \nAghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath, \nPanting, and pale with fear of future death. \nThe god had figur'd her as driv'n along \nBy winds and waves, and scudding thro' the throng. \nJust opposite, sad Nilus opens wide \nHis arms and ample bosom to the tide, \nAnd spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast, \nIn which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host. \nThe victor to the gods his thanks express'd, \nAnd Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless'd. \nThree hundred temples in the town he plac'd; \nWith spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd. \nThree shining nights, and three succeeding days, \nThe fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise,\n\nThe domes with songs, the theaters with plays. \nAll altars flame: before each altar lies, \nDrench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice. \nGreat Caesar sits sublime upon his throne, \nBefore Apollo's porch of Parian stone; \nAccepts the presents vow'd for victory, \nAnd hangs the monumental crowns on high. \nVast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along, \nVarious in arms, in habit, and in tongue. \nHere, Mulciber assigns the proper place \nFor Carians, and th' ungirt Numidian race; \nThen ranks the Thracians in the second row, \nWith Scythians, expert in the dart and bow. \nAnd here the tam'd Euphrates humbly glides, \nAnd there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, \nAnd proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; \nThe Danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind, \nAnd Morini, the last of humankind. \nThese figures, on the shield divinely wrought, \nBy Vulcan labor'd, and by Venus brought, \nWith joy and wonder fill the hero's thought. \nUnknown the names, he yet admires the grace, \nAnd bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK IX\n\nWhile these affairs in distant places pass'd, \nThe various Iris Juno sends with haste, \nTo find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, \nThe secret shade of his great grandsire sought. \nRetir'd alone she found the daring man, \nAnd op'd her rosy lips, and thus began: \n\"What none of all the gods could grant thy vows, \nThat, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. \nAeneas, gone to seek th' Arcadian prince, \nHas left the Trojan camp without defense; \nAnd, short of succors there, employs his pains \nIn parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. \nNow snatch an hour that favors thy designs; \nUnite thy forces, and attack their lines.\" \nThis said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight, \nAnd form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight. \nThe Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes, \nAnd thus invokes the goddess as she flies: \n\"Iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r divine \nHas sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine? \nSee, they divide; immortal day appears, \nAnd glitt'ring planets dancing in their spheres! \nWith joy, these happy omens I obey, \nAnd follow to the war the god that leads the way.\" \nThus having said, as by the brook he stood, \nHe scoop'd the water from the crystal flood; \nThen with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws, \nAnd loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows. \nNow march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain, \nWell hors'd, well clad; a rich and shining train. \nMessapus leads the van; and, in the rear, \nThe sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear. \nIn the main battle, with his flaming crest, \nThe mighty Turnus tow'rs above the rest. \nSilent they move, majestically slow, \nLike ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow. \nThe Trojans view the dusty cloud from far, \nAnd the dark menace of the distant war. \nCaicus from the rampire saw it rise, \nBlack'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies. \nThen to his fellows thus aloud he calls: \n\"What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls? \nArm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears \nAnd pointed darts! the Latian host appears.\" \nThus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend \nThe bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend: \nFor their wise gen'ral, with foreseeing care, \nHad charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war, \nNor, tho' provok'd, in open fields advance, \nBut close within their lines attend their chance. \nUnwilling, yet they keep the strict command, \nAnd sourly wait in arms the hostile band. \nThe fiery Turnus flew before the rest: \nA piebald steed of Thracian strain he press'd; \nHis helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest. \nWith twenty horse to second his designs, \nAn unexpected foe, he fac'd the lines. \n\"Is there,\" he said, \"in arms, who bravely dare \nHis leader's honor and his danger share?\" \nThen spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw, \nIn sign of war: applauding shouts ensue. \nAmaz'd to find a dastard race, that run \nBehind the rampires and the battle shun, \nHe rides around the camp, with rolling eyes, \nAnd stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries. \nSo roams the nightly wolf about the fold: \nWet with descending show'rs, and stiff with cold, \nHe howls for hunger, and he grins for pain, \n(His gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain,) \nAnd, impotent of anger, finds no way \nIn his distended paws to grasp the prey. \nThe mothers listen; but the bleating lambs \nSecurely swig the dug, beneath the dams. \nThus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain. \nSharp with desire, and furious with disdain; \nSurveys each passage with a piercing sight, \nTo force his foes in equal field to fight. \nThus while he gazes round, at length he spies, \nWhere, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies, \nClose underneath the walls; the washing tide \nSecures from all approach this weaker side. \nHe takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand \nWith ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand. \nUrg'd by his presence, ev'ry soul is warm'd, \nAnd ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd. \nFrom the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly; \nFat vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the sky. \nWhat pow'r, O Muses, could avert the flame \nWhich threaten'd, in the fleet, the Trojan name? \nTell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure, \nIs hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure. \n'T is said that, when the chief prepar'd his flight, \nAnd fell'd his timber from Mount Ida's height, \nThe grandam goddess then approach'd her son, \nAnd with a mother's majesty begun: \n\"Grant me,\" she said, \"the sole request I bring, \nSince conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king. \nOn Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood, \nWith firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood; \nAnd on the summit rose a sacred grove, \nWhere I was worship'd with religious love. \nThose woods, that holy grove, my long delight, \nI gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight. \nNow, fill'd with fear, on their behalf I come; \nLet neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb \nThe floating forests of the sacred pine; \nBut let it be their safety to be mine.\" \nThen thus replied her awful son, who rolls \nThe radiant stars, and heav'n and earth controls: \n\"How dare you, mother, endless date demand \nFor vessels molded by a mortal hand? \nWhat then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride, \nOf safety certain, on th' uncertain tide? \nYet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o'er, \nThe chief is landed on the Latian shore, \nWhatever ships escape the raging storms, \nAt my command shall change their fading forms \nTo nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way, \nLike Dotis and the daughters of the sea.\" \nTo seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore, \nThe lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore, \nAnd Phlegethon's innavigable flood, \nAnd the black regions of his brother god. \nHe said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod. \nAnd now at length the number'd hours were come, \nPrefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom, \nWhen the great Mother of the Gods was free \nTo save her ships, and finish Jove's decree. \nFirst, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung \nA light that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot along; \nThen from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires, \nWere timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs; \nAnd, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds, \nBoth hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal horror wounds: \n\"O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear, \nAnd know, my ships are my peculiar care. \nWith greater ease the bold Rutulian may, \nWith hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea, \nThan singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge, \nLoos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large, \nExalted each a nymph: forsake the sand, \nAnd swim the seas, at Cybele's command.\" \nNo sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak, \nWhen, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break; \nAnd, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main \nThey plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again: \nAs many beauteous maids the billows sweep, \nAs rode before tall vessels on the deep. \nThe foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast; \nMessapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste; \nOld Tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head, \nCall'd back his waters to their oozy bed. \nTurnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock, \nAnd with these words his trembling troops bespoke: \n\"These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant, \nAnd are by Jove for black presages sent. \nHe takes the cowards' last relief away; \nFor fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay, \nMust yield unfought, a base inglorious prey. \nThe liquid half of all the globe is lost; \nHeav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast. \nTheirs is no more than that small spot of ground \nWhich myriads of our martial men surround. \nTheir fates I fear not, or vain oracles. \n'T was giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas, \nAnd land secure upon the Latian plains: \nTheir promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains. \n'T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy, \nWith sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy. \nShall such affronts as these alone inflame \nThe Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name? \nMy cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife, \nAnd final ruin, for a ravish'd wife. \nWas 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime, \nThey fell; but will they fall a second time? \nOne would have thought they paid enough before, \nTo curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more. \nCan they securely trust their feeble wall, \nA slight partition, a thin interval, \nBetwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho' built \nBy hands divine, yet perish'd by their guilt? \nLend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands, \nTo force from out their lines these dastard bands. \nLess than a thousand ships will end this war, \nNor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare. \nLet all the Tuscans, all th' Arcadians, join! \nNor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design. \nLet them not fear the treasons of the night, \nThe robb'd Palladium, the pretended flight: \nOur onset shall be made in open light. \nNo wooden engine shall their town betray; \nFires they shall have around, but fires by day. \nNo Grecian babes before their camp appear, \nWhom Hector's arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year. \nNow, since the sun is rolling to the west, \nGive we the silent night to needful rest: \nRefresh your bodies, and your arms prepare; \nThe morn shall end the small remains of war.\" \nThe post of honor to Messapus falls, \nTo keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls, \nTo pitch the fires at distances around, \nAnd close the Trojans in their scanty ground. \nTwice seven Rutulian captains ready stand, \nAnd twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command; \nAll clad in shining arms the works invest, \nEach with a radiant helm and waving crest. \nStretch'd at their length, they press the grassy ground;\n\nThey laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,) \nWith lights and cheerful fires renew the day, \nAnd pass the wakeful night in feasts and play. \nThe Trojans, from above, their foes beheld, \nAnd with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd. \nSeiz'd with affright, their gates they first explore; \nJoin works to works with bridges, tow'r to tow'r: \nThus all things needful for defense abound. \nMnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round, \nCommission'd by their absent prince to share \nThe common danger, and divide the care. \nThe soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall, \nBy turns relieve each other on the wall. \nNigh where the foes their utmost guards advance, \nTo watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance. \nHis father Hyrtacus of noble blood; \nHis mother was a huntress of the wood, \nAnd sent him to the wars. Well could he bear \nHis lance in fight, and dart the flying spear, \nBut better skill'd unerring shafts to send. \nBeside him stood Euryalus, his friend: \nEuryalus, than whom the Trojan host \nNo fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast- \nScarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. \nOne was their care, and their delight was one: \nOne common hazard in the war they shar'd, \nAnd now were both by choice upon the guard. \nThen Nisus thus: \"Or do the gods inspire \nThis warmth, or make we gods of our desire? \nA gen'rous ardor boils within my breast, \nEager of action, enemy to rest: \nThis urges me to fight, and fires my mind \nTo leave a memorable name behind. \nThou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine \nTheir scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine \nAlong the ground, an easy conquest lie: \nThe wakeful few the fuming flagon ply; \nAll hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve- \nA thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve. \nOur absent prince both camp and council mourn; \nBy message both would hasten his return: \nIf they confer what I demand on thee, \n(For fame is recompense enough for me,) \nMethinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied \nA way that safely will my passage guide.\" \nEuryalus stood list'ning while he spoke, \nWith love of praise and noble envy struck; \nThen to his ardent friend expos'd his mind: \n\"All this, alone, and leaving me behind! \nAm I unworthy, Nisus, to be join'd? \nThinkist thou I can my share of glory yield, \nOr send thee unassisted to the field? \nNot so my father taught my childhood arms; \nBorn in a siege, and bred among alarms! \nNor is my youth unworthy of my friend, \nNor of the heav'n-born hero I attend. \nThe thing call'd life, with ease I can disclaim, \nAnd think it over-sold to purchase fame.\" \nThen Nisus thus: \"Alas! thy tender years \nWould minister new matter to my fears. \nSo may the gods, who view this friendly strife, \nRestore me to thy lov'd embrace with life, \nCondemn'd to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,) \nThis thy request is cruel and unjust. \nBut if some chance- as many chances are, \nAnd doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war- \nIf one should reach my head, there let it fall, \nAnd spare thy life; I would not perish all. \nThy bloomy youth deserves a longer date: \nLive thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate; \nTo bear my mangled body from the foe, \nOr buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow. \nOr, if hard fortune shall those dues deny, \nThou canst at least an empty tomb supply. \nO let not me the widow's tears renew! \nNor let a mother's curse my name pursue: \nThy pious parent, who, for love of thee, \nForsook the coasts of friendly Sicily, \nHer age committing to the seas and wind, \nWhen ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind.\" \nTo this, Euryalus: \"You plead in vain, \nAnd but protract the cause you cannot gain. \nNo more delays, but haste!\" With that, he wakes \nThe nodding watch; each to his office takes. \nThe guard reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went \nTo find the council at the royal tent. \nAll creatures else forgot their daily care, \nAnd sleep, the common gift of nature, share; \nExcept the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate \nIn nightly council for th' indanger'd state. \nThey vote a message to their absent chief, \nShew their distress, and beg a swift relief. \nAmid the camp a silent seat they chose, \nRemote from clamor, and secure from foes. \nOn their left arms their ample shields they bear, \nThe right reclin'd upon the bending spear. \nNow Nisus and his friend approach the guard, \nAnd beg admission, eager to be heard: \nTh' affair important, not to be deferr'd. \nAscanius bids 'em be conducted in, \nOrd'ring the more experienc'd to begin. \nThen Nisus thus: \"Ye fathers, lend your ears; \nNor judge our bold attempt beyond our years. \nThe foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine, \nNeglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine; \nAnd where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies, \nCov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies, \nBetwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, \nClose by the sea, a passage we have spied, \nWhich will our way to great Aeneas guide. \nExpect each hour to see him safe again, \nLoaded with spoils of foes in battle slain. \nSnatch we the lucky minute while we may; \nNor can we be mistaken in the way; \nFor, hunting in the vale, we both have seen \nThe rising turrets, and the stream between, \nAnd know the winding course, with ev'ry ford.\" \nHe ceas'd; and old Alethes took the word: \n\"Our country gods, in whom our trust we place, \nWill yet from ruin save the Trojan race, \nWhile we behold such dauntless worth appear \nIn dawning youth, and souls so void of fear.\" \nThen into tears of joy the father broke; \nEach in his longing arms by turns he took; \nPanted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke: \n\"Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we, \nIn recompense of such desert, decree? \nThe greatest, sure, and best you can receive, \nThe gods and your own conscious worth will give. \nThe rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow, \nAnd young Ascanius till his manhood owe.\" \n\"And I, whose welfare in my father lies,\" \nAscanius adds, \"by the great deities, \nBy my dear country, by my household gods, \nBy hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes, \nAdjure you both, (on you my fortune stands; \nThat and my faith I plight into your hands,) \nMake me but happy in his safe return, \nWhose wanted presence I can only mourn; \nYour common gift shall two large goblets be \nOf silver, wrought with curious imagery, \nAnd high emboss'd, which, when old Priam reign'd, \nMy conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd; \nAnd more, two tripods cast in antic mold, \nWith two great talents of the finest gold; \nBeside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art, \nWhich Dido gave, when first she gave her heart. \nBut, if in conquer'd Italy we reign, \nWhen spoils by lot the victor shall obtain- \nThou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd: \nThat, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest, \nAnd shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share: \nTwelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair \nAll clad in rich attire, and train'd with care; \nAnd, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains, \nAnd a large portion of the king's domains. \nBut thou, whose years are more to mine allied- \nNo fate my vow'd affection shall divide \nFrom thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine; \nTake full possession; all my soul is thine. \nOne faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend; \nMy life's companion, and my bosom friend: \nMy peace shall be committed to thy care, \nAnd to thy conduct my concerns in war.\" \nThen thus the young Euryalus replied: \n\"Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide, \nThe same shall be my age, as now my youth; \nNo time shall find me wanting to my truth. \nThis only from your goodness let me gain \n(And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain) \nOf Priam's royal race my mother came- \nAnd sure the best that ever bore the name- \nWhom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold \nFrom me departing, but, o'erspent and old, \nMy fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this \n(Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss, \nNor pious blessing taken, her I leave, \nAnd in this only act of all my life deceive. \nBy this right hand and conscious Night I swear, \nMy soul so sad a farewell could not bear. \nBe you her comfort; fill my vacant place \n(Permit me to presume so great a grace) \nSupport her age, forsaken and distress'd. \nThat hope alone will fortify my breast \nAgainst the worst of fortunes, and of fears.\" \nHe said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears. \nThen thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see \nThat image of his filial piety: \n\"So great beginnings, in so green an age, \nExact the faith which I again ingage. \nThy mother all the dues shall justly claim, \nCreusa had, and only want the name. \nWhate'er event thy bold attempt shall have, \n'T is merit to have borne a son so brave. \nNow by my head, a sacred oath, I swear, \n(My father us'd it,) what, returning here \nCrown'd with success, I for thyself prepare, \nThat, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd mother share.\" \nHe said, and weeping, while he spoke the word, \nFrom his broad belt he drew a shining sword, \nMagnificent with gold. Lycaon made, \nAnd in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade. \nThis was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend \nA lion's hide, his body to defend; \nAnd good Alethes furnish'd him, beside, \nWith his own trusty helm, of temper tried. \nThus arm'd they went. The noble Trojans wait \nTheir issuing forth, and follow to the gate \nWith prayers and vows. Above the rest appears \nAscanius, manly far beyond his years, \nAnd messages committed to their care, \nWhich all in winds were lost, and flitting air. \nThe trenches first they pass'd; then took their way \nWhere their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay; \nTo many fatal, ere themselves were slain. \nThey found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain, \nWho, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore. \nUnharness'd chariots stand along the shore: \nAmidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by, \nA medley of debauch and war, they lie. \nObserving Nisus shew'd his friend the sight: \n\"Behold a conquest gain'd without a fight. \nOccasion offers, and I stand prepar'd; \nThere lies our way; be thou upon the guard, \nAnd look around, while I securely go, \nAnd hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe.\" \nSoftly he spoke; then striding took his way, \nWith his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay; \nHis head rais'd high on tapestry beneath, \nAnd heaving from his breast, he drew his breath; \nA king and prophet, by King Turnus lov'd: \nBut fate by prescience cannot be remov'd. \nHim and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies \nWhere Remus, with his rich retinue, lies. \nHis armor-bearer first, and next he kills \nHis charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels \nAnd his lov'd horses; last invades their lord; \nFull on his neck he drives the fatal sword: \nThe gasping head flies off; a purple flood \nFlows from the trunk, that welters in the blood, \nWhich, by the spurning heels dispers'd around, \nThe bed besprinkles and bedews the ground. \nLamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong, \nHe slew, and then Serranus fair and young. \nFrom dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest, \nAnd puff'd the fumy god from out his breast: \nEv'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play- \nMore lucky, had it lasted till the day. \nThe famish'd lion thus, with hunger bold, \nO'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold, \nAnd tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe \nTrembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw. \nNor with less rage Euryalus employs \nThe wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys; \nBut on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew; \nHe Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew. \nOppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell, \nBut Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all: \nBehind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear; \nThe fatal iron found and reach'd him there; \nFor, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked side, \nAnd, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed. \nThe wound pours out a stream of wine and blood; \nThe purple soul comes floating in the flood. \nNow, where Messapus quarter'd, they arrive. \nThe fires were fainting there, and just alive; \nThe warrior-horses, tied in order, fed. \nNisus observ'd the discipline, and said: \n\"Our eager thirst of blood may both betray; \nAnd see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day, \nFoe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend; \nHere let our glutted execution end. \nA lane thro' slaughter'd bodies we have made.\" \nThe bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd. \nOf arms, and arras, and of plate, they find \nA precious load; but these they leave behind. \nYet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay \nTo make the rich caparison his prey, \nWhich on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay. \nNor did his eyes less longingly behold \nThe girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold. \nThis present Caedicus the rich bestow'd \nOn Remulus, when friendship first they vow'd, \nAnd, absent, join'd in hospitable ties: \nHe, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize; \nTill, by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd, \nHe fell; and they the glorious gift possess'd. \nThese glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain) \nHe to his body suits, but suits in vain: \nMessapus' helm he finds among the rest, \nAnd laces on, and wears the waving crest. \nProud of their conquest, prouder of their prey, \nThey leave the camp, and take the ready way. \nBut far they had not pass'd, before they spied \nThree hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide. \nThe queen a legion to King Turnus sent; \nBut the swift horse the slower foot prevent, \nAnd now, advancing, sought the leader's tent. \nThey saw the pair; for, thro' the doubtful shade, \nHis shining helm Euryalus betray'd, \nOn which the moon with full reflection play'd. \n\"'T is not for naught,\" cried Volscens from the crowd, \n\"These men go there;\" then rais'd his voice aloud: \n\"Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent? \nFrom whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?\" \nSilent they scud away, and haste their flight \nTo neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night. \nThe speedy horse all passages belay, \nAnd spur their smoking steeds to cross their way, \nAnd watch each entrance of the winding wood. \nBlack was the forest: thick with beech it stood, \nHorrid with fern, and intricate with thorn; \nFew paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn.\n\nThe darkness of the shades, his heavy prey, \nAnd fear, misled the younger from his way. \nBut Nisus hit the turns with happier haste, \nAnd, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd, \nAnd Alban plains, from Alba's name so call'd, \nWhere King Latinus then his oxen stall'd; \nTill, turning at the length, he stood his ground, \nAnd miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes around: \n\"Ah wretch!\" he cried, \"where have I left behind \nTh' unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find? \nOr what way take?\" Again he ventures back, \nAnd treads the mazes of his former track. \nHe winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise \nOf tramping coursers, and the riders' voice. \nThe sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd \nThe foes inclosing, and his friend pursued, \nForelaid and taken, while he strove in vain \nThe shelter of the friendly shades to gain. \nWhat should he next attempt? what arms employ, \nWhat fruitless force, to free the captive boy? \nOr desperate should he rush and lose his life, \nWith odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife? \nResolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook; \nAnd, casting on the moon a mournful look: \n\"Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night, \nFair queen,\" he said, \"direct my dart aright. \nIf e'er my pious father, for my sake, \nDid grateful off'rings on thy altars make, \nOr I increas'd them with my sylvan toils, \nAnd hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils, \nGive me to scatter these.\" Then from his ear \nHe pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear. \nThe deadly weapon, hissing from the grove, \nImpetuous on the back of Sulmo drove; \nPierc'd his thin armor, drank his vital blood, \nAnd in his body left the broken \nHe staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death, \nAnd with short sobs he gasps away his breath. \nAll stand amaz'd- a second jav'lin flies \nWith equal strength, and quivers thro' the skies. \nThis thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way, \nAnd in the brainpan warmly buried lay. \nFierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round, \nDescried not him who gave the fatal wound, \nNor knew to fix revenge: \"But thou,\" he cries, \n\"Shalt pay for both,\" and at the pris'ner flies \nWith his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair, \nThat cruel sight the lover could not bear; \nBut from his covert rush'd in open view, \nAnd sent his voice before him as he flew: \n\"Me! me!\" he cried- \"turn all your swords alone \nOn me- the fact confess'd, the fault my own. \nHe neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth: \nYe moon and stars, bear witness to the truth! \nHis only crime (if friendship can offend) \nIs too much love to his unhappy friend.\" \nToo late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides, \nDriv'n with full force, had pierc'd his tender sides. \nDown fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound \nGush'd out a purple stream, and stain'd the ground. \nHis snowy neck reclines upon his breast, \nLike a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd; \nLike a white poppy sinking on the plain, \nWhose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain. \nDespair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd, \nDrove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd. \nVolscens he seeks; on him alone he bends: \nBorne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends, \nOnward he press'd, and kept him still in sight; \nThen whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might: \nTh' unerring steel descended while he spoke, \nPiered his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke. \nDying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain, \nWith swimming eyes he sought his lover slain; \nThen quiet on his bleeding bosom fell, \nContent, in death, to be reveng'd so well. \nO happy friends! for, if my verse can give \nImmortal life, your fame shall ever live, \nFix'd as the Capitol's foundation lies, \nAnd spread, where'er the Roman eagle flies! \nThe conqu'ring party first divide the prey, \nThen their slain leader to the camp convey. \nWith wonder, as they went, the troops were fill'd, \nTo see such numbers whom so few had kill'd. \nSerranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found: \nVast crowds the dying and the dead surround; \nAnd the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground. \nAll knew the helmet which Messapus lost, \nBut mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost. \nNow rose the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed, \nAnd with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread; \nNor long the sun his daily course withheld, \nBut added colors to the world reveal'd: \nWhen early Turnus, wak'ning with the light, \nAll clad in armor, calls his troops to fight. \nHis martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd, \nAnd his own ardor in their souls inspir'd. \nThis done- to give new terror to his foes, \nThe heads of Nisus and his friend he shows, \nRais'd high on pointed spears- a ghastly sight: \nLoud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight. \nMeantime the Trojans run, where danger calls; \nThey line their trenches, and they man their walls. \nIn front extended to the left they stood; \nSafe was the right, surrounded by the flood. \nBut, casting from their tow'rs a frightful view, \nThey saw the faces, which too well they knew, \nTho' then disguis'd in death, and smear'd all o'er \nWith filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore. \nSoon hasty fame thro' the sad city bears \nThe mournful message to the mother's ears. \nAn icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes; \nHer cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes. \nShe runs the rampires round amidst the war, \nNor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair, \nAnd fills with loud laments the liquid air. \n\"Thus, then, my lov'd Euryalus appears! \nThus looks the prop my declining years! \nWas't on this face my famish'd eyes I fed? \nAh! how unlike the living is the dead! \nAnd could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone? \nNot one kind kiss from a departing son! \nNo look, no last adieu before he went, \nIn an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent! \nCold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay, \nTo Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey! \nNor was I near to close his dying eyes, \nTo wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies, \nTo call about his corpse his crying friends, \nOr spread the mantle (made for other ends) \nOn his dear body, which I wove with care, \nNor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare. \nWhere shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains \nHis trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains? \nFor this, alas! I left my needful ease, \nExpos'd my life to winds and winter seas! \nIf any pity touch Rutulian hearts, \nHere empty all your quivers, all your darts; \nOr, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe, \nAnd send me thunderstruck to shades below!\" \nHer shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans' ears, \nUnman their courage, and augment their fears; \nNor young Ascanius could the sight sustain, \nNor old Ilioneus his tears restrain, \nBut Actor and Idaeus jointly sent, \nTo bear the madding mother to her tent. \nAnd now the trumpets terribly, from far, \nWith rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy war. \nThe soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds; \nAnd heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds. \nThe Volscians bear their shields upon their head, \nAnd, rushing forward, form a moving shed. \nThese fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down: \nSome raise the ladders; others scale the town. \nBut, where void spaces on the walls appear, \nOr thin defense, they pour their forces there. \nWith poles and missive weapons, from afar, \nThe Trojans keep aloof the rising war. \nTaught, by their ten years' siege, defensive fight, \nThey roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight, \nTo break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow, \nWhich yet the patient Volscians undergo: \nBut could not bear th' unequal combat long; \nFor, where the Trojans find the thickest throng, \nThe ruin falls: their shatter'd shields give way, \nAnd their crush'd heads become an easy prey. \nThey shrink for fear, abated of their rage, \nNor longer dare in a blind fight engage; \nContented now to gall them from below \nWith darts and slings, and with the distant bow. \nElsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view, \nA blazing pine within the trenches threw. \nBut brave Messapus, Neptune's warlike son, \nBroke down the palisades, the trenches won, \nAnd loud for ladders calls, to scale the town. \nCalliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine, \nInspire your poet in his high design, \nTo sing what slaughter manly Turnus made, \nWhat souls he sent below the Stygian shade, \nWhat fame the soldiers with their captain share, \nAnd the vast circuit of the fatal war; \nFor you in singing martial facts excel; \nYou best remember, and alone can tell. \nThere stood a tow'r, amazing to the sight, \nBuilt up of beams, and of stupendous height: \nArt, and the nature of the place, conspir'd \nTo furnish all the strength that war requir'd. \nTo level this, the bold Italians join; \nThe wary Trojans obviate their design; \nWith weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below, \nShoot thro' the loopholes, and sharp jav'lins throw. \nTurnus, the chief, toss'd from his thund'ring hand \nAgainst the wooden walls, a flaming brand: \nIt stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high; \nThe planks were season'd, and the timber dry. \nContagion caught the posts; it spread along, \nScorch'd, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng. \nThe Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain, \nStill gath'ring fast upon the trembling train; \nTill, crowding to the corners of the wall, \nDown the defense and the defenders fall. \nThe mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound: \nThe dead and dying Trojans strew the ground. \nThe tow'r, that follow'd on the fallen crew, \nWhelm'd o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew: \nSome stuck upon the darts themselves had sent; \nAll the same equal ruin underwent. \nYoung Lycus and Helenor only scape; \nSav'd- how, they know not- from the steepy leap. \nHelenor, elder of the two: by birth, \nOn one side royal, one a son of earth, \nWhom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare, \nAnd sent her boasted bastard to the war \n(A privilege which none but freemen share). \nSlight were his arms, a sword and silver shield: \nNo marks of honor charg'd its empty field. \nLight as he fell, so light the youth arose, \nAnd rising, found himself amidst his foes; \nNor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way. \nEmbolden'd by despair, he stood at bay; \nAnd- like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds \nOf eager huntsmen and invading hounds- \nResolv'd on death, he dissipates his fears, \nAnd bounds aloft against the pointed spears: \nSo dares the youth, secure of death; and throws \nHis dying body on his thickest foes. \nBut Lycus, swifter of his feet by far, \nRuns, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war; \nSprings to the walls, and leaves his foes behind, \nAnd snatches at the beam he first can find; \nLooks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch, \nIn hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach. \nBut Turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey \n(His spear had almost reach'd him in the way, \nShort of his reins, and scarce a span behind) \n\"Fool!\" said the chief, \"tho' fleeter than the wind, \nCouldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue?\" \nHe said, and downward by the feet he drew \nThe trembling dastard; at the tug he falls; \nVast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls. \nThus on some silver swan, or tim'rous hare, \nJove's bird comes sousing down from upper air; \nHer crooked talons truss the fearful prey: \nThen out of sight she soars, and wings her way. \nSo seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb, \nIn vain lamented by the bleating dam. \nThen rushing onward with a barb'rous cry, \nThe troops of Turnus to the combat fly. \nThe ditch with fagots fill'd, the daring foe \nToss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw. \nIlioneus, as bold Lucetius came \nTo force the gate, and feed the kindling flame, \nRoll'd down the fragment of a rock so right, \nIt crush'd him double underneath the weight. \nTwo more young Liger and Asylas slew: \nTo bend the bow young Liger better knew; \nAsylas best the pointed jav'lin threw. \nBrave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain; \nThe victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain. \nBy the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall, \nSagar, and Ida, standing on the wall. \nFrom Capys' arms his fate Privernus found: \nHurt by Themilla first-but slight the wound- \nHis shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart, \nHe clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part: \nThe second shaft came swift and unespied, \nAnd pierc'd his hand, and nail'd it to his side, \nTransfix'd his breathing lungs and beating heart: \nThe soul came issuing out, and hiss'd against the dart. \nThe son of Arcens shone amid the rest, \nIn glitt'ring armor and a purple vest, \n(Fair was his face, his eyes inspiring love,) \nBred by his father in the Martian grove, \nWhere the fat altars of Palicus flame, \nAnd send in arms to purchase early fame. \nHim when he spied from far, the Tuscan king \nLaid by the lance, and took him to the sling, \nThrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw: \nThe heated lead half melted as it flew; \nIt pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain; \nThe youth came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain. \nThen young Ascanius, who, before this day, \nWas wont in woods to shoot the savage prey, \nFirst bent in martial strife the twanging bow, \nAnd exercis'd against a human foe- \nWith this bereft Numanus of his life, \nWho Turnus' younger sister took to wife. \nProud of his realm, and of his royal bride, \nVaunting before his troops, and lengthen'd with a stride,\n\nIn these insulting terms the Trojans he defied: \n\"Twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown- \nCoop'd up a second time within your town! \nWho dare not issue forth in open field, \nBut hold your walls before you for a shield. \nThus threat you war? thus our alliance force? \nWhat gods, what madness, hether steer'd your course? \nYou shall not find the sons of Atreus here, \nNor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear. \nStrong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood, \nWe bear our newborn infants to the flood; \nThere bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold, \nWith winter harden'd, and inur'd to cold. \nThey wake before the day to range the wood, \nKill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer'd food. \nNo sports, but what belong to war, they know: \nTo break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow. \nOur youth, of labor patient, earn their bread; \nHardly they work, with frugal diet fed. \nFrom plows and harrows sent to seek renown, \nThey fight in fields, and storm the shaken town. \nNo part of life from toils of war is free, \nNo change in age, or diff'rence in degree. \nWe plow and till in arms; our oxen feel, \nInstead of goads, the spur and pointed steel; \nTh' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain. \nEv'n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain: \nThe body, not the mind; nor can control \nTh' immortal vigor, or abate the soul. \nOur helms defend the young, disguise the gray: \nWe live by plunder, and delight in prey. \nYour vests embroider'd with rich purple shine; \nIn sloth you glory, and in dances join. \nYour vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride \nYour turbants underneath your chins are tied. \nGo, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again! \nGo, less than women, in the shapes of men! \nGo, mix'd with eunuchs, in the Mother's rites, \nWhere with unequal sound the flute invites; \nSing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida's shade: \nResign the war to men, who know the martial trade!\" \nThis foul reproach Ascanius could not hear \nWith patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear. \nAt the full stretch of both his hands he drew, \nAnd almost join'd the horns of the tough yew. \nBut, first, before the throne of Jove he stood, \nAnd thus with lifted hands invok'd the god: \n\"My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed! \nAn annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed; \nA snow-white steer, before thy altar led, \nWho, like his mother, bears aloft his head, \nButts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands, \nAnd dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands.\" \nJove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear, \nAnd thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear. \nSounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies \nThe feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies. \nThe steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way: \nExtended on the ground, Numanus lay. \n\"Go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn! \nThe Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.\"\n\nAscanius said no more. The Trojans shake \nThe heav'ns with shouting, and new vigor take. \nApollo then bestrode a golden cloud, \nTo view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; \nAnd thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud: \n\"Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame, \nAnd wide from east to west extend thy name; \nOffspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe \nTo thee a race of demigods below. \nThis is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs divine \nFrom this beginning date the Julian line. \nTo thee, to them, and their victorious heirs, \nThe conquer'd war is due, and the vast world is theirs. \nTroy is too narrow for thy name.\" He said, \nAnd plunging downward shot his radiant head; \nDispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight: \nShorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight. \nOld Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire, \nNow left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: \nHis wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, \nHis mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, \nAnd thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: \n\"Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son, \nThe warlike prize thou hast already won. \nThe god of archers gives thy youth a part \nOf his own praise, nor envies equal art. \nNow tempt the war no more.\" He said, and flew \nObscure in air, and vanish'd from their view. \nThe Trojans, by his arms, their patron know, \nAnd hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow. \nThen duteous force they use, and Phoebus' name, \nTo keep from fight the youth too fond of fame. \nUndaunted, they themselves no danger shun; \nFrom wall to wall the shouts and clamors run. \nThey bend their bows; they whirl their slings around; \nHeaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground; \nAnd helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound. \nThe combat thickens, like the storm that flies \nFrom westward, when the show'ry Kids arise; \nOr patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main, \nWhen Jupiter descends in harden'd rain, \nOr bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound, \nAnd with an armed winter strew the ground. \nPand'rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war, \nWhom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare \nOn Ida's top, two youths of height and size \nLike firs that on their mother mountain rise, \nPresuming on their force, the gates unbar, \nAnd of their own accord invite the war. \nWith fates averse, against their king's command, \nArm'd, on the right and on the left they stand, \nAnd flank the passage: shining steel they wear, \nAnd waving crests above their heads appear. \nThus two tall oaks, that Padus' banks adorn, \nLift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn, \nAnd, overpress'd with nature's heavy load, \nDance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod. \nIn flows a tide of Latians, when they see \nThe gate set open, and the passage free; \nBold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on, \nEquicolus, that in bright armor shone, \nAnd Haemon first; but soon repuls'd they fly, \nOr in the well-defended pass they die. \nThese with success are fir'd, and those with rage, \nAnd each on equal terms at length ingage. \nDrawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain, \nThe Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain. \nFierce Turnus in another quarter fought, \nWhen suddenly th' unhop'd-for news was brought, \nThe foes had left the fastness of their place, \nPrevail'd in fight, and had his men in chase. \nHe quits th' attack, and, to prevent their fate, \nRuns where the giant brothers guard the gate. \nThe first he met, Antiphates the brave, \nBut base-begotten on a Theban slave, \nSarpedon's son, he slew: the deadly dart \nFound passage thro' his breast, and pierc'd his heart. \nFix'd in the wound th' Italian cornel stood, \nWarm'd in his lungs, and in his vital blood. \nAphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies, \nAnd Meropes, and the gigantic size \nOf Bitias, threat'ning with his ardent eyes. \nNot by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd \n(A dart were lost within that roomy breast), \nBut from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong, \nWhich roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along: \nNot two bull hides th' impetuous force withhold, \nNor coat of double mail, with scales of gold. \nDown sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground; \nHis arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast body sound, \nNot with less ruin than the Bajan mole, \nRais'd on the seas, the surges to control- \nAt once comes tumbling down the rocky wall; \nProne to the deep, the stones disjointed fall \nOf the vast pile; the scatter'd ocean flies; \nBlack sands, discolor'd froth, and mingled mud arise: \nThe frighted billows roll, and seek the shores; \nThen trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars: \nTyphoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove's command, \nAstonish'd at the flaw that shakes the land, \nSoon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake, \nWith wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back. \nThe warrior god the Latian troops inspir'd, \nNew strung their sinews, and their courage fir'd, \nBut chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright: \nThen black despair precipitates their flight. \nWhen Pandarus beheld his brother kill'd, \nThe town with fear and wild confusion fill'd, \nHe turns the hinges of the heavy gate \nWith both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight\n\nSome happier friends within the walls inclos'd; \nThe rest shut out, to certain death expos'd: \nFool as he was, and frantic in his care, \nT' admit young Turnus, and include the war! \nHe thrust amid the crowd, securely bold, \nLike a fierce tiger pent amid the fold. \nToo late his blazing buckler they descry, \nAnd sparkling fires that shot from either eye, \nHis mighty members, and his ample breast, \nHis rattling armor, and his crimson crest. \nFar from that hated face the Trojans fly, \nAll but the fool who sought his destiny. \nMad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd \nFor Bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud: \n\"These are not Ardea's walls, nor this the town \nAmata proffers with Lavinia's crown: \n'T is hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft, \nNo means of safe return by flight are left.\" \nTo whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate, \nThus Turnus: \"Then begin, and try thy fate: \nMy message to the ghost of Priam bear; \nTell him a new Achilles sent thee there.\" \nA lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw, \nRough in the rind, and knotted as it grew: \nWith his full force he whirl'd it first around; \nBut the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound: \nImperial Juno turn'd the course before, \nAnd fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door. \n\"But hope not thou,\" said Turnus, \"when I strike, \nTo shun thy fate: our force is not alike, \nNor thy steel temper'd by the Lemnian god.\" \nThen rising, on his utmost stretch he stood, \nAnd aim'd from high: the full descending blow \nCleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two. \nDown sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound: \nHis pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground; \nBlood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound: \nScalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides, \nAnd the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides. \nThe Trojans fly from their approaching fate; \nAnd, had the victor then secur'd the gate, \nAnd to his troops without unclos'd the bars, \nOne lucky day had ended all his wars. \nBut boiling youth, and blind desire of blood, \nPush'd on his fury, to pursue the crowd. \nHamstring'd behind, unhappy Gyges died; \nThen Phalaris is added to his side. \nThe pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew, \nAnd their friends' arms against their fellows threw. \nStrong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies; \nSaturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies. \nThen Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall- \nIngag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall: \nBut, whom they fear'd without, they found within. \nAt last, tho' late, by Lynceus he was seen. \nHe calls new succors, and assaults the prince: \nBut weak his force, and vain is their defense. \nTurn'd to the right, his sword the hero drew, \nAnd at one blow the bold aggressor slew. \nHe joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong, \nThe helm flies off, and bears the head along. \nNext him, the huntsman Amycus he kill'd, \nIn darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd. \nThen Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear, \nAnd Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear: \nHe fought with courage, and he sung the fight; \nArms were his bus'ness, verses his delight. \nThe Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief, \nTheir slaughter'd friends, and hasten their relief. \nBold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train, \nWhom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain. \nTo save the living, and revenge the dead, \nAgainst one warrior's arms all Troy they led. \n\"O, void of sense and courage!\" Mnestheus cried, \n\"Where can you hope your coward heads to hide? \nAh! where beyond these rampires can you run? \nOne man, and in your camp inclos'd, you shun! \nShall then a single sword such slaughter boast, \nAnd pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host? \nForsaking honor, and renouncing fame, \nYour gods, your country, and your king you shame!\" \nThis just reproach their virtue does excite: \nThey stand, they join, they thicken to the fight. \nNow Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield, \nBut with slow paces measures back the field, \nAnd inches to the walls, where Tiber's tide, \nWashing the camp, defends the weaker side. \nThe more he loses, they advance the more, \nAnd tread in ev'ry step he trod before. \nThey shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might \nThey cannot conquer, they oppress with weight. \nAs, compass'd with a wood of spears around, \nThe lordly lion still maintains his ground; \nGrins horrible, retires, and turns again; \nThreats his distended paws, and shakes his mane; \nHe loses while in vain he presses on, \nNor will his courage let him dare to run: \nSo Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight, \nMoves tardy back, and just recedes from fight. \nYet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews, \nTwice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues. \nBut now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied, \nCome rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side: \nNor Juno, who sustain'd his arms before, \nDares with new strength suffice th' exhausted store; \nFor Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down, \nTo force th' invader from the frighted town. \nWith labor spent, no longer can he wield \nThe heavy fanchion, or sustain the shield, \nO'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they fling: \nThe weapons round his hollow temples ring; \nHis golden helm gives way, with stony blows \nBatter'd, and flat, and beaten to his brows. \nHis crest is rash'd away; his ample shield \nIs falsified, and round with jav'lins fill'd. \nThe foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm; \nAnd Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm. \nSick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev'ry pore; \nWith driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er; \nShorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes; \nAnd vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes. \nPlung'd in the flood, and made the waters fly. \nThe yellow god the welcome burthen bore, \nAnd wip'd the sweat, and wash'd away the gore; \nThen gently wafts him to the farther coast, \nAnd sends him safe to cheer his anxious host. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK X\n\nThe gates of heav'n unfold: Jove summons all \nThe gods to council in the common hall. \nSublimely seated, he surveys from far \nThe fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, \nAnd all th' inferior world. From first to last, \nThe sov'reign senate in degrees are plac'd. \nThen thus th' almighty sire began: \"Ye gods, \nNatives or denizens of blest abodes, \nFrom whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, \nThis backward fate from what was first design'd? \nWhy this protracted war, when my commands \nPronounc'd a peace, and gave the Latian lands? \nWhat fear or hope on either part divides \nOur heav'ns, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides? \nA lawful time of war at length will come, \n(Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), \nWhen Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, \nShall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, \nAnd, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. \nThen is your time for faction and debate, \nFor partial favor, and permitted hate. \nLet now your immature dissension cease; \nSit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.\" \nThus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; \nBut lovely Venus thus replies at large: \n\"O pow'r immense, eternal energy, \n(For to what else protection can we fly?) \nSeest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare \nIn fields, unpunish'd, and insult my care? \nHow lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train, \nIn shining arms, triumphant on the plain? \nEv'n in their lines and trenches they contend, \nAnd scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend: \nThe town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats, \nWith a red deluge, their increasing moats. \nAeneas, ignorant, and far from thence, \nHas left a camp expos'd, without defense. \nThis endless outrage shall they still sustain? \nShall Troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again? \nA second siege my banish'd issue fears, \nAnd a new Diomede in arms appears. \nOne more audacious mortal will be found; \nAnd I, thy daughter, wait another wound. \nYet, if with fates averse, without thy leave, \nThe Latian lands my progeny receive, \nBear they the pains of violated law, \nAnd thy protection from their aid withdraw. \nBut, if the gods their sure success foretell; \nIf those of heav'n consent with those of hell, \nTo promise Italy; who dare debate \nThe pow'r of Jove, or fix another fate? \nWhat should I tell of tempests on the main, \nOf Aeolus usurping Neptune's reign? \nOf Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat \nT' inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet? \nNow Juno to the Stygian sky descends, \nSolicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends. \nThat new example wanted yet above: \nAn act that well became the wife of Jove! \nAlecto, rais'd by her, with rage inflames \nThe peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames. \nImperial sway no more exalts my mind; \n(Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav'n was kind;) \nNow let my happier foes possess my place, \nWhom Jove prefers before the Trojan race; \nAnd conquer they, whom you with conquest grace. \nSince you can spare, from all your wide command, \nNo spot of earth, no hospitable land, \nWhich may my wand'ring fugitives receive; \n(Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;) \nThen, father, (if I still may use that name,) \nBy ruin'd Troy, yet smoking from the flame, \nI beg you, let Ascanius, by my care, \nBe freed from danger, and dismiss'd the war: \nInglorious let him live, without a crown. \nThe father may be cast on coasts unknown, \nStruggling with fate; but let me save the son. \nMine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow'rs: \nIn those recesses, and those sacred bow'rs, \nObscurely let him rest; his right resign \nTo promis'd empire, and his Julian line. \nThen Carthage may th' Ausonian towns destroy, \nNor fear the race of a rejected boy. \nWhat profits it my son to scape the fire, \nArm'd with his gods, and loaded with his sire; \nTo pass the perils of the seas and wind; \nEvade the Greeks, and leave the war behind; \nTo reach th' Italian shores; if, after all, \nOur second Pergamus is doom'd to fall? \nMuch better had he curb'd his high desires, \nAnd hover'd o'er his ill-extinguish'd fires. \nTo Simois' banks the fugitives restore, \nAnd give them back to war, and all the woes before.\" \nDeep indignation swell'd Saturnia's heart: \n\"And must I own,\" she said, \"my secret smart- \nWhat with more decence were in silence kept, \nAnd, but for this unjust reproach, had slept? \nDid god or man your fav'rite son advise, \nWith war unhop'd the Latians to surprise? \nBy fate, you boast, and by the gods' decree, \nHe left his native land for Italy! \nConfess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more \nThan Heav'n inspir'd, he sought a foreign shore! \nDid I persuade to trust his second Troy \nTo the raw conduct of a beardless boy, \nWith walls unfinish'd, which himself forsakes, \nAnd thro' the waves a wand'ring voyage takes? \nWhen have I urg'd him meanly to demand \nThe Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land? \nDid I or Iris give this mad advice, \nOr made the fool himself the fatal choice? \nYou think it hard, the Latians should destroy \nWith swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy! \nHard and unjust indeed, for men to draw \nTheir native air, nor take a foreign law! \nThat Turnus is permitted still to live, \nTo whom his birth a god and goddess give! \nBut yet is just and lawful for your line \nTo drive their fields, and force with fraud to join; \nRealms, not your own, among your clans divide, \nAnd from the bridegroom tear the promis'd bride; \nPetition, while you public arms prepare; \nPretend a peace, and yet provoke a war! \n'T was giv'n to you, your darling son to shroud, \nTo draw the dastard from the fighting crowd, \nAnd, for a man, obtend an empty cloud. \nFrom flaming fleets you turn'd the fire away, \nAnd chang'd the ships to daughters of the sea. \nBut is my crime- the Queen of Heav'n offends, \nIf she presume to save her suff'ring friends! \nYour son, not knowing what his foes decree, \nYou say, is absent: absent let him be. \nYours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow'rs, \nThe soft recesses, and the sacred bow'rs. \nWhy do you then these needless arms prepare, \nAnd thus provoke a people prone to war? \nDid I with fire the Trojan town deface, \nOr hinder from return your exil'd race? \nWas I the cause of mischief, or the man \nWhose lawless lust the fatal war began? \nThink on whose faith th' adult'rous youth relied; \nWho promis'd, who procur'd, the Spartan bride? \nWhen all th' united states of Greece combin'd, \nTo purge the world of the perfidious kind, \nThen was your time to fear the Trojan fate: \nYour quarrels and complaints are now too late.\" \nThus Juno. Murmurs rise, with mix'd applause, \nJust as they favor or dislike the cause. \nSo winds, when yet unfledg'd in woods they lie, \nIn whispers first their tender voices try, \nThen issue on the main with bellowing rage, \nAnd storms to trembling mariners presage. \nThen thus to both replied th' imperial god, \nWho shakes heav'n's axles with his awful nod. \n(When he begins, the silent senate stand \nWith rev'rence, list'ning to the dread command: \nThe clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain; \nAnd the hush'd waves lie flatted on the main.) \n\"Celestials, your attentive ears incline! \nSince,\" said the god, \"the Trojans must not join \nIn wish'd alliance with the Latian line; \nSince endless jarrings and immortal hate \nTend but to discompose our happy state; \nThe war henceforward be resign'd to fate: \nEach to his proper fortune stand or fall; \nEqual and unconcern'd I look on all. \nRutulians, Trojans, are the same to me; \nAnd both shall draw the lots their fates decree. \nLet these assault, if Fortune be their friend; \nAnd, if she favors those, let those defend: \nThe Fates will find their way.\" The Thund'rer said, \nAnd shook the sacred honors of his head, \nAttesting Styx, th' inviolable flood, \nAnd the black regions of his brother god. \nTrembled the poles of heav'n, and earth confess'd the nod.\n\nThis end the sessions had: the senate rise, \nAnd to his palace wait their sov'reign thro' the skies. \nMeantime, intent upon their siege, the foes \nWithin their walls the Trojan host inclose: \nThey wound, they kill, they watch at ev'ry gate; \nRenew the fires, and urge their happy fate. \nTh' Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief, \nHopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief. \nThin on the tow'rs they stand; and ev'n those few \nA feeble, fainting, and dejected crew. \nYet in the face of danger some there stood: \nThe two bold brothers of Sarpedon's blood, \nAsius and Acmon; both th' Assaraci; \nYoung Haemon, and tho' young, resolv'd to die. \nWith these were Clarus and Thymoetes join'd; \nTibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind. \nFrom Acmon's hands a rolling stone there came, \nSo large, it half deserv'd a mountain's name: \nStrong-sinew'd was the youth, and big of bone; \nHis brother Mnestheus could not more have done, \nOr the great father of th' intrepid son. \nSome firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send; \nAnd some with darts, and some with stones defend. \nAmid the press appears the beauteous boy, \nThe care of Venus, and the hope of Troy. \nHis lovely face unarm'd, his head was bare; \nIn ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair. \nHis forehead circled with a diadem; \nDistinguish'd from the crowd, he shines a gem, \nEnchas'd in gold, or polish'd iv'ry set, \nAmidst the meaner foil of sable jet. \nNor Ismarus was wanting to the war, \nDirecting pointed arrows from afar, \nAnd death with poison arm'd- in Lydia born, \nWhere plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn; \nWhere proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands, \nAnd leaves a rich manure of golden sands. \nThere Capys, author of the Capuan name, \nAnd there was Mnestheus too, increas'd in fame, \nSince Turnus from the camp he cast with shame. \nThus mortal war was wag'd on either side. \nMeantime the hero cuts the nightly tide: \nFor, anxious, from Evander when he went, \nHe sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon's tent; \nExpos'd the cause of coming to the chief; \nHis name and country told, and ask'd relief; \nPropos'd the terms; his own small strength declar'd; \nWhat vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar'd: \nWhat Turnus, bold and violent, design'd; \nThen shew'd the slipp'ry state of humankind, \nAnd fickle fortune; warn'd him to beware, \nAnd to his wholesome counsel added pray'r. \nTarchon, without delay, the treaty signs, \nAnd to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins. \nThey soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand; \nTheir forces trusted with a foreign hand. \nAeneas leads; upon his stern appear \nTwo lions carv'd, which rising Ida bear- \nIda, to wand'ring Trojans ever dear. \nUnder their grateful shade Aeneas sate, \nRevolving war's events, and various fate. \nHis left young Pallas kept, fix'd to his side, \nAnd oft of winds enquir'd, and of the tide; \nOft of the stars, and of their wat'ry way; \nAnd what he suffer'd both by land and sea. \nNow, sacred sisters, open all your spring! \nThe Tuscan leaders, and their army sing, \nWhich follow'd great Aeneas to the war: \nTheir arms, their numbers, and their names declare. \nA thousand youths brave Massicus obey, \nBorne in the Tiger thro' the foaming sea; \nFrom Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care: \nFor arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear. \nFierce Abas next: his men bright armor wore; \nHis stern Apollo's golden statue bore. \nSix hundred Populonia sent along, \nAll skill'd in martial exercise, and strong. \nThree hundred more for battle Ilva joins, \nAn isle renown'd for steel, and unexhausted mines. \nAsylas on his prow the third appears, \nWho heav'n interprets, and the wand'ring stars; \nFrom offer'd entrails prodigies expounds, \nAnd peals of thunder, with presaging sounds. \nA thousand spears in warlike order stand, \nSent by the Pisans under his command. \nFair Astur follows in the wat'ry field, \nProud of his manag'd horse and painted shield. \nGravisca, noisome from the neighb'ring fen, \nAnd his own Caere, sent three hundred men; \nWith those which Minio's fields and Pyrgi gave, \nAll bred in arms, unanimous, and brave. \nThou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew, \nAnd brave Cupavo follow'd but by few; \nWhose helm confess'd the lineage of the man, \nAnd bore, with wings display'd, a silver swan. \nLove was the fault of his fam'd ancestry, \nWhose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly. \nFor Cycnus lov'd unhappy Phaeton, \nAnd sung his loss in poplar groves, alone, \nBeneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief. \nHeav'n heard his song, and hasten'd his relief, \nAnd chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair, \nAnd wing'd his flight, to chant aloft in air. \nHis son Cupavo brush'd the briny flood: \nUpon his stern a brawny Centaur stood, \nWho heav'd a rock, and, threat'ning still to throw, \nWith lifted hands alarm'd the seas below: \nThey seem'd to fear the formidable sight, \nAnd roll'd their billows on, to speed his flight. \nOcnus was next, who led his native train \nOf hardy warriors thro' the wat'ry plain: \nThe son of Manto by the Tuscan stream, \nFrom whence the Mantuan town derives the name- \nAn ancient city, but of mix'd descent: \nThree sev'ral tribes compose the government; \nFour towns are under each; but all obey \nThe Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway. \nHate to Mezentius arm'd five hundred more, \nWhom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore: \nMincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover'd o'er.\n\nThese grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep \nWith stretching oars at once the glassy deep. \nHim and his martial train the Triton bears; \nHigh on his poop the sea-green god appears: \nFrowning he seems his crooked shell to sound, \nAnd at the blast the billows dance around. \nA hairy man above the waist he shows; \nA porpoise tail beneath his belly grows; \nAnd ends a fish: his breast the waves divides, \nAnd froth and foam augment the murm'ring tides. \nFull thirty ships transport the chosen train \nFor Troy's relief, and scour the briny main. \nNow was the world forsaken by the sun, \nAnd Phoebe half her nightly race had run. \nThe careful chief, who never clos'd his eyes, \nHimself the rudder holds, the sails supplies. \nA choir of Nereids meet him on the flood, \nOnce his own galleys, hewn from Ida's wood; \nBut now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep, \nAs rode, before, tall vessels on the deep. \nThey know him from afar; and in a ring \nInclose the ship that bore the Trojan king. \nCymodoce, whose voice excell'd the rest, \nAbove the waves advanc'd her snowy breast; \nHer right hand stops the stern; her left divides \nThe curling ocean, and corrects the tides. \nShe spoke for all the choir, and thus began \nWith pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man: \n\"Sleeps our lov'd lord? O goddess-born, awake! \nSpread ev'ry sail, pursue your wat'ry track, \nAnd haste your course. Your navy once were we, \nFrom Ida's height descending to the sea; \nTill Turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood, \nPresum'd to violate our holy wood. \nThen, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires profane \n(Unwillingly we broke our master's chain), \nAnd since have sought you thro' the Tuscan main. \nThe mighty Mother chang'd our forms to these, \nAnd gave us life immortal in the seas. \nBut young Ascanius, in his camp distress'd, \nBy your insulting foes is hardly press'd. \nTh' Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host, \nAdvance in order on the Latian coast: \nTo cut their way the Daunian chief designs, \nBefore their troops can reach the Trojan lines. \nThou, when the rosy morn restores the light, \nFirst arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight: \nThyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield, \nAnd bear aloft th' impenetrable shield. \nTo-morrow's sun, unless my skill be vain, \nShall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain.\" \nParting, she spoke; and with immortal force \nPush'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course; \nFor well she knew the way. Impell'd behind, \nThe ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind. \nThe rest make up. Unknowing of the cause, \nThe chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws. \nThen thus he pray'd, and fix'd on heav'n his eyes: \n\"Hear thou, great Mother of the deities. \nWith turrets crown'd! (on Ida's holy hill \nFierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy will.) \nFirm thy own omens; lead us on to fight; \nAnd let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right.\" \nHe said no more. And now renewing day \nHad chas'd the shadows of the night away. \nHe charg'd the soldiers, with preventing care, \nTheir flags to follow, and their arms prepare; \nWarn'd of th' ensuing fight, and bade 'em hope the war. \nNow, his lofty poop, he view'd below \nHis camp incompass'd, and th' inclosing foe. \nHis blazing shield, imbrac'd, he held on high; \nThe camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply. \nHope arms their courage: from their tow'rs they throw \nTheir darts with double force, and drive the foe. \nThus, at the signal giv'n, the cranes arise \nBefore the stormy south, and blacken all the skies. \nKing Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd, \nTill, looking back, the Trojan fleet he view'd, \nThe seas with swelling canvas cover'd o'er, \nAnd the swift ships descending on the shore. \nThe Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes, \nThe radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise, \nAnd dart diffusive fires around the field, \nAnd the keen glitt'ring the golden shield. \nThus threat'ning comets, when by night they rise, \nShoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies: \nSo Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights, \nPale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright: \nYet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent \nTo man the shores, and hinder their descent, \nAnd thus awakes the courage of his friends: \n\"What you so long have wish'd, kind Fortune sends; \nIn ardent arms to meet th' invading foe: \nYou find, and find him at advantage now. \nYours is the day: you need but only dare; \nYour swords will make you masters of the war. \nYour sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands, \nAnd dearest wifes, are all within your hands. \nBe mindful of the race from whence you came, \nAnd emulate in arms your fathers' fame. \nNow take the time, while stagg'ring yet they stand \nWith feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand: \nFortune befriends the bold.\" Nor more he said, \nBut balanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead; \nThen these elects, the landing to prevent; \nAnd those he leaves, to keep the city pent. \nMeantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore: \nSome are by boats expos'd, by bridges more. \nWith lab'ring oars they bear along the strand, \nWhere the tide languishes, and leap aland. \nTarchon observes the coast with careful eyes, \nAnd, where no ford he finds, no water fries, \nNor billows with unequal murmurs roar, \nBut smoothly slide along, and swell the shore, \nThat course he steer'd, and thus he gave command: \n\"Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land: \nForce on the vessel, that her keel may wound \nThis hated soil, and furrow hostile ground. \nLet me securely land- I ask no more; \nThen sink my ships, or shatter on the shore.\" \nThis fiery speech inflames his fearful friends: \nThey tug at ev'ry oar, and ev'ry stretcher bends; \nThey run their ships aground; the vessels knock, \n(Thus forc'd ashore,) and tremble with the shock. \nTarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood, \nStuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood: \nShe breaks her back; the loosen'd sides give way, \nAnd plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea. \nTheir broken oars and floating planks withstand \nTheir passage, while they labor to the land, \nAnd ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand. \nNow Turnus leads his troops without delay, \nAdvancing to the margin of the sea. \nThe trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail'd \nThe clowns new-rais'd and raw, and soon prevail'd. \nGreat Theron fell, an omen of the fight; \nGreat Theron, large of limbs, of giant height. \nHe first in open field defied the prince: \nBut armor scal'd with gold was no defense \nAgainst the fated sword, which open'd wide \nHis plated shield, and pierc'd his naked side. \nNext, Lichas fell, who, not like others born, \nWas from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn; \nSacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee; \nFor his beginning life from biting steel was free. \nNot far from him was Gyas laid along, \nOf monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong: \nVain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail'd, \nNor valor nor Herculean arms avail'd, \nNor their fam'd father, wont in war to go \nWith great Alcides, while he toil'd below. \nThe noisy Pharos next receiv'd his death: \nAeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling breath.\n\nThen wretched Cydon had receiv'd his doom, \nWho courted Clytius in his beardless bloom, \nAnd sought with lust obscene polluted joys: \nThe Trojan sword had curd his love of boys, \nHad not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course \nOf the fierce champions, with united force. \nSev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound \nFrom his bright shield, some on his helmet sound: \nThe rest had reach'd him; but his mother's care \nPrevented those, and turn'd aside in air. \nThe prince then call'd Achates, to supply \nThe spears that knew the way to victory- \n\"Those fatal weapons, which, inur'd to blood, \nIn Grecian bodies under Ilium stood: \nNot one of those my hand shall toss in vain \nAgainst our foes, on this contended plain.\" \nHe said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw; \nWhich, wing'd with fate, thro' Maeon's buckler flew, \nPierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his heart: \nHe stagger'd with intolerable smart. \nAlcanor saw; and reach'd, but reach'd in vain, \nHis helping hand, his brother to sustain. \nA second spear, which kept the former course, \nFrom the same hand, and sent with equal force, \nHis right arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft \nHis use of both, and pinion'd down his left. \nThen Numitor from his dead brother drew \nTh' ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw: \nPreventing fate directs the lance awry, \nWhich, glancing, only mark'd Achates' thigh. \nIn pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came, \nAnd, from afar, at Dryops took his aim. \nThe spear flew hissing thro' the middle space, \nAnd pierc'd his throat, directed at his face; \nIt stopp'd at once the passage of his wind, \nAnd the free soul to flitting air resign'd: \nHis forehead was the first that struck the ground; \nLifeblood and life rush'd mingled thro' the wound. \nHe slew three brothers of the Borean race, \nAnd three, whom Ismarus, their native place, \nHad sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace. \nHalesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads: \nThe son of Neptune to his aid succeeds, \nConspicuous on his horse. On either hand, \nThese fight to keep, and those to win, the land. \nWith mutual blood th' Ausonian soil is dyed, \nWhile on its borders each their claim decide. \nAs wintry winds, contending in the sky, \nWith equal force of lungs their titles try: \nThey rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n \nStands without motion, and the tide undriv'n: \nEach bent to conquer, neither side to yield, \nThey long suspend the fortune of the field. \nBoth armies thus perform what courage can; \nFoot set to foot, and mingled man to man. \nBut, in another part, th' Arcadian horse \nWith ill success ingage the Latin force: \nFor, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing down, \nHuge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown, \nThey left their coursers, and, unus'd to fight \nOn foot, were scatter'd in a shameful flight. \nPallas, who with disdain and grief had view'd \nHis foes pursuing, and his friends pursued, \nUs'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs, his last resource,\n\nWith these to move their minds, with those to fire their force\n\n\"Which way, companions? whether would you run? \nBy you yourselves, and mighty battles won, \nBy my great sire, by his establish'd name, \nAnd early promise of my future fame; \nBy my youth, emulous of equal right \nTo share his honors- shun ignoble flight! \nTrust not your feet: your hands must hew way \nThro' yon black body, and that thick array: \n'T is thro' that forward path that we must come; \nThere lies our way, and that our passage home. \nNor pow'rs above, nor destinies below \nOppress our arms: with equal strength we go, \nWith mortal hands to meet a mortal foe. \nSee on what foot we stand: a scanty shore, \nThe sea behind, our enemies before; \nNo passage left, unless we swim the main; \nOr, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain.\" \nThis said, he strode with eager haste along, \nAnd bore amidst the thickest of the throng. \nLagus, the first he met, with fate to foe, \nHad heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw: \nStooping, the spear descended on his chine, \nJust where the bone distinguished either loin: \nIt stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay, \nThat scarce the victor forc'd the steel away. \nHisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow \nTo wish'd revenge, the prince prevents his blow; \nFor, warding his at once, at once he press'd, \nAnd plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast. \nThen lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust, \nWho stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust. \nAnd, after him, the Daucian twins were slain, \nLaris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain; \nSo wondrous like in feature, shape, and size, \nAs caus'd an error in their parents' eyes- \nGrateful mistake! but soon the sword decides \nThe nice distinction, and their fate divides: \nFor Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris' hand, \nDismember'd, sought its owner on the strand: \nThe trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain, \nAnd threaten still th' intended stroke in vain. \nNow, to renew the charge, th' Arcadians came: \nSight of such acts, and sense of honest shame, \nAnd grief, with anger mix'd, their minds inflame. \nThen, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain, \nWho chanc'd, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain: \nThe flying spear was after Ilus sent; \nBut Rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant: \nFrom Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled, \nThe lance, athwart his body, laid him dead: \nRoll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound, \nAnd intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground. \nAs when, in summer, welcome winds arise, \nThe watchful shepherd to the forest flies, \nAnd fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads, \nAnd catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads; \nAround the forest flies the furious blast, \nAnd all the leafy nation sinks at last, \nAnd Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste; \nThe pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory, \nBeholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky: \nSo Pallas' troops their scatter'd strength unite, \nAnd, pouring on their foes, their prince delight. \nHalesus came, fierce with desire of blood; \nBut first collected in his arms he stood: \nAdvancing then, he plied the spear so well, \nLadon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell. \nAround his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand, \nAnd from Strymonius hew'd his better hand, \nHeld up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a stone \nAt Thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone: \nIt struck beneath the space of either eye; \nAnd blood, and mingled brains, together fly. \nDeep skill'd in future fates, Halesus' sire \nDid with the youth to lonely groves retire: \nBut, when the father's mortal race was run, \nDire destiny laid hold upon the son, \nAnd haul'd him to the war, to find, beneath \nTh' Evandrian spear, a memorable death. \nPallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws, \nTo Tuscan Tiber thus address'd his vows: \n\"O sacred stream, direct my flying dart, \nAnd give to pass the proud Halesus' heart! \nHis arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear.\" \nPleas'd with the bribe, the god receiv'd his pray'r: \nFor, while his shield protects a friend distress'd, \nThe dart came driving on, and pierc'd his breast. \nBut Lausus, no small portion of the war, \nPermits not panic fear to reign too far, \nCaus'd by the death of so renown'd a knight; \nBut by his own example cheers the fight. \nFierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay \nOf Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day. \nThe Phrygian troops escap'd the Greeks in vain: \nThey, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain. \nTo the rude shock of war both armies came; \nTheir leaders equal, and their strength the same. \nThe rear so press'd the front, they could not wield \nTheir angry weapons, to dispute the field. \nHere Pallas urges on, and Lausus there: \nOf equal youth and beauty both appear, \nBut both by fate forbid to breathe their native air. \nTheir congress in the field great Jove withstands: \nBoth doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands. \nMeantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief \nOf Lausus' danger, urging swift relief. \nWith his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd, \nAnd, making to his friends, thus calls aloud: \n\"Let none presume his needless aid to join; \nRetire, and clear the field; the fight is mine: \nTo this right hand is Pallas only due; \nO were his father here, my just revenge to view!\" \nFrom the forbidden space his men retir'd. \nPallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd; \nSurvey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight, \nStruck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height. \nThen to the king: \"Your empty vaunts forbear; \nSuccess I hope, and fate I cannot fear; \nAlive or dead, I shall deserve a name; \nJove is impartial, and to both the same.\" \nHe said, and to the void advanc'd his pace: \nPale horror sate on each Arcadian face. \nThen Turnus, from his chariot leaping light, \nAddress'd himself on foot to single fight. \nAnd, as a lion- when he spies from far \nA bull that seems to meditate the war, \nBending his neck, and spurning back the sand- \nRuns roaring downward from his hilly stand: \nImagine eager Turnus not more slow, \nTo rush from high on his unequal foe. \nYoung Pallas, when he saw the chief advance \nWithin due distance of his flying lance, \nPrepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try \nIf fortune would his want of force supply; \nAnd thus to Heav'n and Hercules address'd: \n\"Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest, \nHis son adjures you by those holy rites, \nThat hospitable board, those genial nights; \nAssist my great attempt to gain this prize, \nAnd let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes, \nHis ravish'd spoils.\" 'T was heard, the vain request; \nAlcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast. \nThen Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began: \n\"Short bounds of life are set to mortal man. \n'T is virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span. \nSo many sons of gods, in bloody fight, \nAround the walls of Troy, have lost the light: \nMy own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe; \nNor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow. \nEv'n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath, \nAnd stands already on the verge of death.\" \nThis said, the god permits the fatal fight, \nBut from the Latian fields averts his sight. \nNow with full force his spear young Pallas threw, \nAnd, having thrown, his shining fauchion drew \nThe steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint, \nAnd mark'd it slightly with the glancing point, \nFierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew, \nAnd pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw: \nThen, as the winged weapon whizz'd along, \n\"See now,\" said he, \"whose arm is better strung.\" \nThe spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd \nBy plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid: \nThro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd, \nHis corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his heart at last. \nIn vain the youth tugs at the broken wood; \nThe soul comes issuing with the vital blood: \nHe falls; his arms upon his body sound; \nAnd with his bloody teeth he bites the ground. \nTurnus bestrode the corpse: \"Arcadians, hear,\" \nSaid he; \"my message to your master bear: \nSuch as the sire deserv'd, the son I send; \nIt costs him dear to be the Phrygians' friend. \nThe lifeless body, tell him, I bestow, \nUnask'd, to rest his wand'ring ghost below.\" \nHe said, and trampled down with all the force \nOf his left foot, and spurn'd the wretched corse; \nThen snatch'd the shining belt, with gold inlaid; \nThe belt Eurytion's artful hands had made, \nWhere fifty fatal brides, express'd to sight, \nAll in the compass of one mournful night, \nDepriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light. \nIn an ill hour insulting Turnus tore \nThose golden spoils, and in a worse he wore. \nO mortals, blind in fate, who never know \nTo bear high fortune, or endure the low! \nThe time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain, \nShall wish untouch'd the trophies of the slain; \nShall wish the fatal belt were far away, \nAnd curse the dire remembrance of the day. \nThe sad Arcadians, from th' unhappy field, \nBear back the breathless body on a shield. \nO grace and grief of war! at once restor'd, \nWith praises, to thy sire, at once deplor'd! \nOne day first sent thee to the fighting field, \nBeheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd; \nOne day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield. \nThis dismal news, not from uncertain fame, \nBut sad spectators, to the hero came: \nHis friends upon the brink of ruin stand, \nUnless reliev'd by his victorious hand. \nHe whirls his sword around, without delay, \nAnd hews thro' adverse foes an ample way, \nTo find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud: \nEvander, Pallas, all that friendship ow'd \nTo large deserts, are present to his eyes; \nHis plighted hand, and hospitable ties. \nFour sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred, \nHe took in fight, and living victims led, \nTo please the ghost of Pallas, and expire, \nIn sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire. \nAt Magus next he threw: he stoop'd below \nThe flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow; \nThen, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd: \n\"By young Iulus, by thy father's shade, \nO spare my life, and send me back to see \nMy longing sire, and tender progeny! \nA lofty house I have, and wealth untold, \nIn silver ingots, and in bars of gold: \nAll these, and sums besides, which see no day, \nThe ransom of this one poor life shall pay. \nIf I survive, will Troy the less prevail? \nA single soul's too light to turn the scale.\" \nHe said. The hero sternly thus replied: \n\"Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside, \nLeave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke \nAll rules of war by one relentless stroke, \nWhen Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone \nMy father's shadow, but my living son.\" \nThus having said, of kind remorse bereft, \nHe seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left; \nThen with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd, \nUp to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd. \nApollo's priest, Emonides, was near; \nHis holy fillets on his front appear; \nGlitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd; \nMuch of his god, more of his purple, proud. \nHim the fierce Trojan follow'd thro' the field: \nThe holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield, \nThe prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow, \nSent him an off'ring to the shades below. \nHis arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears, \nDesign'd a trophy to the God of Wars. \nVulcanian Caeculus renews the fight, \nAnd Umbro, born upon the mountains' height. \nThe champion cheers his troops t' encounter those, \nAnd seeks revenge himself on other foes. \nAt Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow, \nBoth shield and arm to ground together go. \nAnxur had boasted much of magic charms, \nAnd thought he wore impenetrable arms, \nSo made by mutter'd spells; and, from the spheres, \nHad life secur'd, in vain, for length of years. \nThen Tarquitus the field triumph trod; \nA nymph his mother, his sire a god. \nExulting in bright arms, he braves the prince: \nWith his protended lance he makes defense; \nBears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on, \nArrests his better hand, and drags him down; \nStands o'er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay, \nVain tales inventing, and prepar'd to pray, \nMows off his head: the trunk a moment stood, \nThen sunk, and roll'd along the sand in blood. \nThe vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain: \n\"Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain; \nLie there, inglorious, and without a tomb, \nFar from thy mother and thy native home, \nExposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey, \nOr thrown for food to monsters of the sea.\" \nOn Lycas and Antaeus next he ran, \nTwo chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van. \nThey fled for fear; with these, he chas'd along \nCamers the yellow-lock'd, and Numa strong; \nBoth great in arms, and both were fair and young. \nCamers was son to Volscens lately slain, \nIn wealth surpassing all the Latian train, \nAnd in Amycla fix'd his silent easy reign. \nAnd, as Aegaeon, when with heav'n he strove, \nStood opposite in arms to mighty Jove; \nMov'd all his hundred hands, provok'd the war, \nDefied the forky lightning from afar; \nAt fifty mouths his flaming breath expires, \nAnd flash for flash returns, and fires for fires; \nIn his right hand as many swords he wields, \nAnd takes the thunder on as many shields: \nWith strength like his, the Trojan hero stood; \nAnd soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd, \nWhen once his fauchion found the taste of blood. \nWith fury scarce to be conceiv'd, he flew \nAgainst Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew. \nThey, when they see the fiery chief advance, \nAnd pushing at their chests his pointed lance, \nWheel'd with so swift a motion, mad with fear, \nThey threw their master headlong from the chair. \nThey stare, they start, nor stop their course, before \nThey bear the bounding chariot to the shore. \nNow Lucagus and Liger scour the plains, \nWith two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins, \nAnd Lucagus the lofty seat maintains: \nBold brethren both. The former wav'd in air \nHis flaming sword: Aeneas couch'd his spear, \nUnus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear. \nThen Liger thus: \"Thy confidence is vain \nTo scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain: \nNor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode, \nNor this the chariot where Achilles rode; \nNor Venus' veil is here, near Neptune's shield; \nThy fatal hour is come, and this the field.\" \nThus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan \nReturn'd his answer with his flying spear. \nAs Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends, \nProne to the wheels, and his left foot protends, \nPrepar'd for fight; the fatal dart arrives, \nAnd thro' the borders of his buckler drives; \nPass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound, \nCast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground. \nWhom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite: \n\"Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight; \nVain shadows did not force their swift retreat; \nBut you yourself forsake your empty seat.\" \nHe said, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein; \nFor Liger lay already on the plain, \nBy the same shock: then, stretching out his hands, \nThe recreant thus his wretched life demands: \n\"Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man! \nBy her and him from whom thy breath began, \nWho form'd thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare \nThis forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's pray'r.\" \nThus much he spoke, and more he would have said; \nBut the stern hero turn'd aside his head, \nAnd cut him short: \"I hear another man; \nYou talk'd not thus before the fight began. \nNow take your turn; and, as a brother should, \nAttend your brother to the Stygian flood.\" \nThen thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent, \nAnd the soul issued at the gaping vent. \nAs storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground, \nThus rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around. \nAt length Ascanius and the Trojan train \nBroke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain. \nMeantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man \nHeld conference with his queen, and thus began: \n\"My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife, \nStill think you Venus' aid supports the strife- \nSustains her Trojans- or themselves, alone, \nWith inborn valor force their fortune on? \nHow fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd! \nJudge if such warriors want immortal aid.\" \nTo whom the goddess with the charming eyes, \nSoft in her tone, submissively replies: \n\"Why, O my sov'reign lord, whose frown I fear, \nAnd cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear; \nWhy urge you thus my grief? when, if I still \n(As once I was) were mistress of your will, \nFrom your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife \nMight gain the grace of length'ning Turnus' life, \nSecurely snatch him from the fatal fight, \nAnd give him to his aged father's sight. \nNow let him perish, since you hold it good, \nAnd glut the Trojans with his pious blood. \nYet from our lineage he derives his name, \nAnd, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came; \nYet he devoutly pays you rites divine, \nAnd offers daily incense at your shrine.\" \nThen shortly thus the sov'reign god replied: \n\"Since in my pow'r and goodness you confide, \nIf for a little space, a lengthen'd span, \nYou beg reprieve for this expiring man, \nI grant you leave to take your Turnus hence \nFrom instant fate, and can so far dispense. \nBut, if some secret meaning lies beneath, \nTo save the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death, \nOr if a farther thought you entertain, \nTo change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain.\" \nTo whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes: \n\"And what if that request, your tongue denies, \nYour heart should grant; and not a short reprieve, \nBut length of certain life, to Turnus give? \nNow speedy death attends the guiltless youth, \nIf my presaging soul divines with truth; \nWhich, O! I wish, might err thro' causeless fears, \nAnd you (for you have pow'r) prolong his years!\" \nThus having said, involv'd in clouds, she flies, \nAnd drives a storm before her thro' the skies. \nSwift she descends, alighting on the plain, \nWhere the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain. \nOf air condens'd a specter soon she made; \nAnd, what Aeneas was, such seem'd the shade. \nAdorn'd with Dardan arms, the phantom bore \nHis head aloft; a plumy crest he wore; \nThis hand appear'd a shining sword to wield,. \nAnd that sustain'd an imitated shield. \nWith manly mien he stalk'd along the ground, \nNor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound. \n(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight, \nOr dreadful visions in our dreams by night.) \nThe specter seems the Daunian chief to dare, \nAnd flourishes his empty sword in air. \nAt this, advancing, Turnus hurl'd his spear: \nThe phantom wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for fear. \nDeluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled, \nAnd with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed. \n\"Whether, O coward?\" (thus he calls aloud, \nNor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,) \n\"Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me \nThe fated land you sought so long by sea.\" \nHe said, and, brandishing at once his blade, \nWith eager pace pursued the flying shade. \nBy chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore, \nWhich from old Clusium King Osinius bore: \nThe plank was ready laid for safe ascent; \nFor shelter there the trembling shadow bent, \nAnd skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went. \nExulting Turnus, with regardless haste, \nAscends the plank, and to the galley pass'd. \nScarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's hand \nThe haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land. \nWith wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea, \nAnd measures back with speed her former way. \nMeantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe, \nAnd sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below. \nThe guileful phantom now forsook the shroud, \nAnd flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud. \nToo late young Turnus the delusion found, \nFar on the sea, still making from the ground. \nThen, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame, \nWith sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame, \nFearful besides of what in fight had pass'd, \nHis hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast; \n\"O Jove!\" he cried, \"for what offense have \nDeserv'd to bear this endless infamy? \nWhence am I forc'd, and whether am I borne? \nHow, and with what reproach, shall I return? \nShall ever I behold the Latian plain, \nOr see Laurentum's lofty tow'rs again? \nWhat will they say of their deserting chief \nThe war was mine: I fly from their relief; \nI led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave; \nAnd ev'n from hence their dying groans receive. \nHere, overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie; \nThere, scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly. \nGape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive! \nOr, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve! \nOn sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive; \nOr set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore, \nWhere no Rutulian eyes may see me more, \nUnknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame, \nLest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.\" \nThus Turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd: \nThe choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd. \nAnd now the sword, and now the sea took place, \nThat to revenge, and this to purge disgrace. \nSometimes he thought to swim the stormy main, \nBy stretch of arms the distant shore to gain. \nThrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the flood; \nBut Juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood. \nAnd thrice repress'd his rage; strong gales supplied, \nAnd push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide. \nAt length she lands him on his native shores, \nAnd to his father's longing arms restores. \nMeantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius arm'd, \nSucceeding Turnus, with his ardor warm'd \nHis fainting friends, reproach'd their shameful flight, \nRepell'd the victors, and renew'd the fight. \nAgainst their king the Tuscan troops conspire; \nSuch is their hate, and such their fierce desire \nOf wish'd revenge: on him, and him alone, \nAll hands employ'd, and all their darts are thrown. \nHe, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd, \nTo raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd, \nFrom his proud summit looking down, disdains \nTheir empty menace, and unmov'd remains. \nBeneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead, \nThen Latagus, and Palmus as he fled. \nAt Latagus a weighty stone he flung: \nHis face was flatted, and his helmet rung. \nBut Palmus from behind receives his wound; \nHamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground: \nHis crest and armor, from his body torn, \nThy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn. \nEvas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew. \nMimas his birth from fair Theano drew, \nBorn on that fatal night, when, big with fire, \nThe queen produc'd young Paris to his sire: \nBut Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain, \nUnthinking Mimas on the Latian plain. \nAnd, as a savage boar, on mountains bred, \nWith forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed, \nWhen once he sees himself in toils inclos'd, \nBy huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd- \nHe whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war; \nTh' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar: \nAll keep aloof, and safely shout around; \nBut none presumes to give a nearer wound: \nHe frets and froths, erects his bristled hide, \nAnd shakes a grove of lances from his side: \nNot otherwise the troops, with hate inspir'd, \nAnd just revenge against the tyrant fir'd, \nTheir darts with clamor at a distance drive, \nAnd only keep the languish'd war alive. \nFrom Coritus came Acron to the fight, \nWho left his spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate night. \nMezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride, \nProud of the purple favors of his bride. \nThen, as a hungry lion, who beholds \nA gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds, \nOr beamy stag, that grazes on the plain- \nHe runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane, \nHe grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws; \nThe prey lies panting underneath his paws: \nHe fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er \nWith unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore: \nSo proud Mezentius rushes on his foes, \nAnd first unhappy Acron overthrows: \nStretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground; \nThe lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the wound.\n\nThen with disdain the haughty victor view'd \nOrodes flying, nor the wretch pursued, \nNor thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound, \nBut, running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground: \nThen turning short, he met him face to face, \nTo give his victor the better grace. \nOrodes falls, equal fight oppress'd: \nMezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast, \nAnd rested lance; and thus aloud he cries: \n\"Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!\" \nThe fields around with Io Paean! ring; \nAnd peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king. \nAt this the vanquish'd, with his dying breath, \nThus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death: \n\"Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain: \nLike death attends thee on this fatal plain.\" \nThen, sourly smiling, thus the king replied: \n\"For what belongs to me, let Jove provide; \nBut die thou first, whatever chance ensue.\" \nHe said, and from the wound the weapon drew. \nA hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight, \nAnd seal'd his eyes in everlasting night. \nBy Caedicus, Alcathous was slain; \nSacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain; \nOrses the strong to greater strength must yield; \nHe, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill'd. \nThen brave Messapus Ericetes slew, \nWho from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew. \nBut from his headstrong horse his fate he found, \nWho threw his master, as he made a bound: \nThe chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground; \nThen Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails: \nThe Trojan sinks, and Neptune's son prevails. \nAgis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride, \nTo single fight the boldest foe defied; \nWhom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame, \nAnd not belied his mighty father's fame. \nSalius to death the great Antronius sent: \nBut the same fate the victor underwent, \nSlain by Nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw \nThe flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow. \nThus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance; \nBy turns they quit their ground, by turns advance: \nVictors and vanquish'd, in the various field, \nNor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield. \nThe gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife, \nAnd mourn the miseries of human life. \nAbove the rest, two goddesses appear \nConcern'd for each: here Venus, Juno there. \nAmidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes \nHer scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes. \nOnce more the proud Mezentius, with disdain, \nBrandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain, \nWhere tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood, \nLike tall Orion stalking o'er the flood. \n(When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves, \nHis shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves), \nOr like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread, \nDeep fix'd in earth; in clouds he hides his head. \nThe Trojan prince beheld him from afar, \nAnd dauntless undertook the doubtful war. \nCollected in his strength, and like a rock, \nPois'd on his base, Mezentius stood the shock. \nHe stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes \nThe space his spear could reach, aloud he cries: \n\"My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke! \n(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.) \nHis armor, from the Trojan pirate torn, \nBy my triumphant Lausus shall be worn.\" \nHe said; and with his utmost force he threw \nThe massy spear, which, hissing as it flew, \nReach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course; \nBut, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force \nTook a new bent obliquely, and betwixt \nThe side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd. \nAnthores had from Argos travel'd far, \nAlcides' friend, and brother of the war; \nTill, tir'd with toils, fair Italy he chose, \nAnd in Evander's palace sought repose. \nNow, falling by another's wound, his eyes \nHe cast to heav'n, on Argos thinks, and dies. \nThe pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent; \nThe shield gave way; thro' treble plates it went \nOf solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd, \nAnd three bull hides which round the buckler fold. \nAll these it pass'd, resistless in the course, \nTranspierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force. \nThe gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood. \nThe Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood, \nHis faunchion drew, to closer fight address'd, \nAnd with new force his fainting foe oppress'd. \nHis father's peril Lausus view'd with grief; \nHe sigh'd, he wept, he ran to his relief. \nAnd here, heroic youth, 't is here I must \nTo thy immortal memory be just, \nAnd sing an act so noble and so new, \nPosterity will scarce believe 't is true. \nPain'd with his wound, and useless for the fight, \nThe father sought to save himself by flight: \nIncumber'd, slow he dragg'd the spear along, \nWhich pierc'd his thigh, and in his buckler hung. \nThe pious youth, resolv'd on death, below \nThe lifted sword springs forth to face the foe; \nProtects his parent, and prevents the blow. \nShouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field, \nTo see the son the vanquish'd father shield. \nAll, fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive, \nAnd with a storm of darts to distance drive \nThe Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far, \nOn his Vulcanian orb sustain'd the war. \nAs, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind, \nThe plowman, passenger, and lab'ring hind \nFor shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly, \nOr hous'd, or safe in hollow caverns lie; \nBut, that o'erblown, when heav'n above 'em smiles, \nReturn to travel, and renew their toils: \nAeneas thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side, \nThe storm of darts, undaunted, did abide; \nAnd thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat'ning cried:\n\n\"Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage \nIn rash attempts, beyond thy tender age, \nBetray'd by pious love?\" Nor, thus forborne, \nThe youth desists, but with insulting scorn \nProvokes the ling'ring prince, whose patience, tir'd, \nGave place; and all his breast with fury fir'd. \nFor now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears; \nAnd lifted high the flaming sword appears, \nWhich, full descending with a frightful sway, \nThro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way, \nAnd buried deep in his fair bosom lay. \nThe purple streams thro' the thin armor strove, \nAnd drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his mother wove; \nAnd life at length forsook his heaving heart, \nLoth from so sweet a mansion to depart. \nBut when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread, \nThe pious prince beheld young Lausus dead, \nHe griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought \nOf his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought: \nThen stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said: \n\"Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid \nTo love so great, to such transcendent store \nOf early worth, and sure presage of more? \nAccept whate'er Aeneas can afford; \nUntouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword; \nAnd all that pleas'd thee living, still remain \nInviolate, and sacred to the slain. \nThy body on thy parents I bestow, \nTo rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know, \nOr have a sense of human things below. \nThere to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell: \n''T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell.'\" \nWith this, his distant friends he beckons near, \nProvokes their duty, and prevents their fear: \nHimself assists to lift him from the ground, \nWith clotted locks, and blood that well'd from out the wound.\n\nMeantime, his father, now no father, stood, \nAnd wash'd his wounds by Tiber's yellow flood: \nOppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent, \nHis fainting limbs against an oak he leant. \nA bough his brazen helmet did sustain; \nHis heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain: \nA chosen train of youth around him stand; \nHis drooping head was rested on his hand: \nHis grisly beard his pensive bosom sought; \nAnd all on Lausus ran his restless thought. \nCareful, concern'd his danger to prevent, \nHe much enquir'd, and many a message sent \nTo warn him from the field- alas! in vain! \nBehold, his mournful followers bear him slain! \nO'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound, \nAnd drew a bloody trail along the ground. \nFar off he heard their cries, far off divin'd \nThe dire event, with a foreboding mind. \nWith dust he sprinkled first his hoary head; \nThen both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread; \nLast, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said: \n\"What joys, alas! could this frail being give, \nThat I have been so covetous to live? \nTo see my son, and such a son, resign \nHis life, a ransom for preserving mine! \nAnd am I then preserv'd, and art thou lost? \nHow much too dear has that redemption cost! \n'T is now my bitter banishment I feel: \nThis is a wound too deep for time to heal. \nMy guilt thy growing virtues did defame; \nMy blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name. \nChas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and exil'd \nFor foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild: \nI ow'd my people these, and, from their hate, \nWith less resentment could have borne my fate. \nAnd yet I live, and yet sustain the sight \nOf hated men, and of more hated light: \nBut will not long.\" With that he rais'd from ground \nHis fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound; \nYet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd \nWith pains or perils, for his courser call'd \nWell-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress \nWith daily care, and mounted with success; \nHis aid in arms, his ornament in peace. \nSoothing his courage with a gentle stroke, \nThe steed seem'd sensible, while thus he spoke: \n\"O Rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me- \nIf life and long were terms that could agree! \nThis day thou either shalt bring back the head \nAnd bloody trophies of the Trojan dead; \nThis day thou either shalt revenge my woe, \nFor murther'd Lausus, on his cruel foe; \nOr, if inexorable fate deny \nOur conquest, with thy conquer'd master die: \nFor, after such a lord, rest secure, \nThou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure.\" \nHe said; and straight th' officious courser kneels, \nTo take his wonted weight. His hands he fills \nWith pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd \nHis glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd \nWith waving horsehair, nodding from afar; \nThen spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war. \nLove, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought, \nDespair, and secret shame, and conscious thought \nOf inborn worth, his lab'ring soul oppress'd, \nRoll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his breast. \nThen loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name: \nThe loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came. \n\"Great Jove,\" he said, \"and the far-shooting god, \nInspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!\" \nHe spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of fear, \nAnd threaten'd with his long protended spear. \nTo whom Mezentius thus: \"Thy vaunts are vain. \nMy Lausus lies extended on the plain: \nHe's lost! thy conquest is already won; \nThe wretched sire is murther'd in the son. \nNor fate I fear, but all the gods defy. \nForbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to die; \nBut first receive this parting legacy.\" \nHe said; and straight a whirling dart he sent; \nAnother after, and another went. \nRound in a spacious ring he rides the field, \nAnd vainly plies th' impenetrable shield. \nThrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd, \nTurn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb withstood \nThe strokes, and bore about an iron wood. \nImpatient of delay, and weary grown, \nStill to defend, and to defend alone, \nTo wrench the darts which in his buckler light, \nUrg'd and o'er-labor'd in unequal fight; \nAt length resolv'd, he throws with all his force \nFull at the temples of the warrior horse. \nJust where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear \nMade way, and stood transfix'd thro' either ear. \nSeiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd with fright, \nThe wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright, \nLights on his feet before; his hoofs behind \nSpring up in air aloft, and lash the wind. \nDown comes the rider headlong from his height: \nHis horse came after with unwieldy weight, \nAnd, flound'ring forward, pitching on his head, \nHis lord's incumber'd shoulder overlaid. \nFrom either host, the mingled shouts and cries \nOf Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies. \nAeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal sword \nHigh o'er his head, with this reproachful word: \n\"Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain \nOf proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?\" \nStruggling, and wildly staring on the skies, \nWith scarce recover'd sight he thus replies: \n\"Why these insulting words, this waste of breath, \nTo souls undaunted, and secure of death? \n'T is no dishonor for the brave to die, \nNor came I here with hope victory; \nNor ask I life, nor fought with that design: \nAs I had us'd my fortune, use thou thine. \nMy dying son contracted no such band; \nThe gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand. \nFor this, this only favor let me sue, \nIf pity can to conquer'd foes be due: \nRefuse it not; but let my body have \nThe last retreat of humankind, a grave. \nToo well I know th' insulting people's hate; \nProtect me from their vengeance after fate: \nThis refuge for my poor remains provide, \nAnd lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side.\" \nHe said, and to the sword his throat applied. \nThe crimson stream distain'd his arms around, \nAnd the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XI\n\nScarce had the rosy Morning rais'd her head \nAbove the waves, and left her wat'ry bed; \nThe pious chief, whom double cares attend \nFor his unburied soldiers and his friend, \nYet first to Heav'n perform'd a victor's vows: \nHe bar'd an ancient oak of all her boughs; \nThen on a rising ground the trunk he plac'd, \nWhich with the spoils of his dead foe he grac'd. \nThe coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn, \nNow on a naked snag in triumph borne, \nWas hung on high, and glitter'd from afar, \nA trophy sacred to the God of War. \nAbove his arms, fix'd on the leafless wood, \nAppear'd his plumy crest, besmear'd with blood: \nHis brazen buckler on the left was seen; \nTruncheons of shiver'd lances hung between; \nAnd on the right was placed his corslet, bor'd; \nAnd to the neck was tied his unavailing sword. \nA crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man, \nWho thus, conspicuous in the midst, began: \n\"Our toils, my friends, are crown'd with sure success; \nThe greater part perform'd, achieve the less. \nNow follow cheerful to the trembling town; \nPress but an entrance, and presume it won. \nFear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies, \nAs the first fruits of war, a sacrifice. \nTurnus shall fall extended on the plain, \nAnd, in this omen, is already slain. \nPrepar'd in arms, pursue your happy chance; \nThat none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance, \nAnd I, at Heav'n's appointed hour, may find \nYour warlike ensigns waving in the wind. \nMeantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare, \nDue to your dead companions of the war: \nThe last respect the living can bestow, \nTo shield their shadows from contempt below. \nThat conquer'd earth be theirs, for which they fought, \nAnd which for us with their own blood they bought; \nBut first the corpse of our unhappy friend \nTo the sad city of Evander send, \nWho, not inglorious, in his age's bloom, \nWas hurried hence by too severe a doom.\" \nThus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, \nWhere, new in death, lamented Pallas lay. \nAcoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd \nThe father's trust; and now the son he serv'd \nWith equal faith, but less auspicious care. \nTh' attendants of the slain his sorrow share. \nA troop of Trojans mix'd with these appear, \nAnd mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair. \nSoon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; \nAll beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky. \nThey rear his drooping forehead from the ground; \nBut, when Aeneas view'd the grisly wound \nWhich Pallas in his manly bosom bore, \nAnd the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore; \nFirst, melting into tears, the pious man \nDeplor'd so sad a sight, then thus began: \n\"Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest \nOf my full wishes, she refus'd the best! \nShe came; but brought not thee along, to bless \nMy longing eyes, and share in my success: \nShe grudg'd thy safe return, the triumphs due \nTo prosp'rous valor, in the public view. \nNot thus I promis'd, when thy father lent \nThy needless succor with a sad consent; \nEmbrac'd me, parting for th' Etrurian land, \nAnd sent me to possess a large command. \nHe warn'd, and from his own experience told, \nOur foes were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold. \nAnd now perhaps, in hopes of thy return, \nRich odors on his loaded altars burn, \nWhile we, with vain officious pomp, prepare \nTo send him back his portion of the war, \nA bloody breathless body, which can owe \nNo farther debt, but to the pow'rs below. \nThe wretched father, ere his race is run, \nShall view the fun'ral honors of his son. \nThese are my triumphs of the Latian war, \nFruits of my plighted faith and boasted care! \nAnd yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see \nA son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry; \nThou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd: \nThy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd. \nHe died no death to make thee wish, too late, \nThou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate: \nBut what a champion has th' Ausonian coast, \nAnd what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!\" \nThus having mourn'd, he gave the word around, \nTo raise the breathless body from the ground; \nAnd chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all \nHis warlike troops, to wait the funeral, \nTo bear him back and share Evander's grief: \nA well-becoming, but a weak relief. \nOf oaken twigs they twist an easy bier, \nThen on their shoulders the sad burden rear. \nThe body on this rural hearse is borne: \nStrew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn. \nAll pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow'r, \nNew cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r: \nUnfaded yet, but yet unfed below, \nNo more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe. \nThen two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost, \nOf purple woven, and with gold emboss'd, \nFor ornament the Trojan hero brought, \nWhich with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought. \nOne vest array'd the corpse; and one they spread \nO'er his clos'd eyes, and wrapp'd around his head, \nThat, when the yellow hair in flame should fall, \nThe catching fire might burn the golden caul. \nBesides, the spoils of foes in battle slain, \nWhen he descended on the Latian plain; \nArms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led \nIn long array- th' achievements of the dead. \nThen, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear \nTh' unhappy captives, marching in the rear, \nAppointed off'rings in the victor's name, \nTo sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral flame. \nInferior trophies by the chiefs are borne; \nGauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn; \nAnd fair inscriptions fix'd, and titles read \nOf Latian leaders conquer'd by the dead. \nAcoetes on his pupil's corpse attends, \nWith feeble steps, supported by his friends. \nPausing at ev'ry pace, in sorrow drown'd, \nBetwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground; \nWhere grov'ling while he lies in deep despair, \nHe beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair. \nThe champion's chariot next is seen to roll, \nBesmear'd with hostile blood, and honorably foul. \nTo close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state, \nIs led, the fun'rals of his lord to wait. \nStripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace \nHe walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face. \nThe lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest, \nAre borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest. \nThe march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound; \nThe pikes and lances trail along the ground. \nThus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse \nTo Pallantean tow'rs direct their course, \nIn long procession rank'd, the pious chief \nStopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to grief: \n\"The public care,\" he said, \"which war attends, \nDiverts our present woes, at least suspends. \nPeace with the manes of great Pallas dwell! \nHail, holy relics! and a last farewell!\" \nHe said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd, \nRestrained his tears, and to the camp return'd. \nNow suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand \nA truce, with olive branches in their hand; \nObtest his clemency, and from the plain \nBeg leave to draw the bodies of their slain. \nThey plead, that none those common rites deny \nTo conquer'd foes that in fair battle die. \nAll cause of hate was ended in their death; \nNor could he war with bodies void of breath. \nA king, they hop'd, would hear a king's request, \nWhose son he once was call'd, and once his guest. \nTheir suit, which was too just to be denied, \nThe hero grants, and farther thus replied: \n\"O Latian princes, how severe a fate \nIn causeless quarrels has involv'd your state, \nAnd arm'd against an unoffending man, \nWho sought your friendship ere the war began! \nYou beg a truce, which I would gladly give, \nNot only for the slain, but those who live. \nI came not hither but by Heav'n's command, \nAnd sent by fate to share the Latian land. \nNor wage I wars unjust: your king denied \nMy proffer'd friendship, and my promis'd bride; \nLeft me for Turnus. Turnus then should try \nHis cause in arms, to conquer or to die. \nMy right and his are in dispute: the slain \nFell without fault, our quarrel to maintain. \nIn equal arms let us alone contend; \nAnd let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. \nThis is the way (so tell him) to possess \nThe royal virgin, and restore the peace. \nBear this message back, with ample leave, \nThat your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive.\" \nThus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd, \nStood mute a while, and on each other gaz'd. \nDrances, their chief, who harbor'd in his breast \nLong hate to Turnus, as his foe profess'd, \nBroke silence first, and to the godlike man, \nWith graceful action bowing, thus began: \n\"Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name, \nBut yet whose actions far transcend your fame; \nWould I your justice or your force express, \nThought can but equal; and all words are less. \nYour answer we shall thankfully relate, \nAnd favors granted to the Latian state. \nIf wish'd success our labor shall attend, \nThink peace concluded, and the king your friend: \nLet Turnus leave the realm to your command, \nAnd seek alliance in some other land: \nBuild you the city which your fates assign; \nWe shall be proud in the great work to join.\" \nThus Drances; and his words so well persuade \nThe rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made. \nTwelve days the term allow'd: and, during those, \nLatians and Trojans, now no longer foes, \nMix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare \nTo fell the timber, and forget the war. \nLoud axes thro' the groaning groves resound; \nOak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground; \nFirst fall from high; and some the trunks receive \nIn loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave. \nAnd now the fatal news by Fame is blown \nThro' the short circuit of th' Arcadian town, \nOf Pallas slain- by Fame, which just before \nHis triumphs on distended pinions bore. \nRushing from out the gate, the people stand, \nEach with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand. \nWildly they stare, distracted with amaze: \nThe fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze, \nThat cast a sullen splendor on their friends, \nThe marching troop which their dead prince attends. \nBoth parties meet: they raise a doleful cry; \nThe matrons from the walls with shrieks reply, \nAnd their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky. \nThe town is fill'd with tumult and with tears, \nTill the loud clamors reach Evander's ears: \nForgetful of his state, he runs along, \nWith a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng; \nFalls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies, \nWith silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes. \nShort sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks \nA passage, and at once he weeps and speaks: \n\"O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word, \nTo fight with caution, not to tempt the sword! \nI warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew \nWhat perils youthful ardor would pursue, \nThat boiling blood would carry thee too far, \nYoung as thou wert in dangers, raw to war! \nO curst essay of arms, disastrous doom, \nPrelude of bloody fields, and fights to come! \nHard elements of unauspicious war, \nVain vows to Heav'n, and unavailing care! \nThrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed, \nWhose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled, \nPraescious of ills, and leaving me behind, \nTo drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd! \nBeyond the goal of nature I have gone: \nMy Pallas late set out, but reach'd too soon. \nIf, for my league against th' Ausonian state, \nAmidst their weapons I had found my fate, \n(Deserv'd from them,) then I had been return'd \nA breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd. \nYet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid, \nNor grudge th' alliance I so gladly made. \n'T was not his fault, my Pallas fell so young, \nBut my own crime, for having liv'd too long. \nYet, since the gods had destin'd him to die, \nAt least he led the way to victory: \nFirst for his friends he won the fatal shore, \nAnd sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before; \nA death too great, too glorious to deplore. \nNor will I add new honors to thy grave, \nContent with those the Trojan hero gave: \nThat funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd, \nIn which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd. \nGreat spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they bear: \nThen let thy own achievements be thy share. \nEven thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, \nWhose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood, \nIf Pallas had arriv'd, with equal length \nOf years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. \nBut why, unhappy man, dost thou detain \nThese troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain? \nGo, friends, this message to your lord relate: \nTell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, \nAnd, after Pallas' death, live ling'ring on, \n'T is to behold his vengeance for my son. \nI stay for Turnus, whose devoted head \nIs owing to the living and the dead. \nMy son and I expect it from his hand; \n'T is all that he can give, or we demand. \nJoy is no more; but I would gladly go, \nTo greet my Pallas with such news below.\" \nThe morn had now dispell'd the shades of night, \nRestoring toils, when she restor'd the light. \nThe Trojan king and Tuscan chief command \nTo raise the piles along the winding strand. \nTheir friends convey the dead fun'ral fires; \nBlack smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires; \nThe light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires. \nThen thrice around the kindled piles they go \n(For ancient custom had ordain'd it so) \nThrice horse and foot about the fires are led; \nAnd thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead. \nTears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, \nAnd drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. \nAmid the blaze, their pious brethren throw \nThe spoils, in battle taken from the foe: \nHelms, bits emboss'd, and swords of shining steel; \nOne casts a target, one a chariot wheel; \nSome to their fellows their own arms restore: \nThe fauchions which in luckless fight they bore, \nTheir bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in vain, \nAnd shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain. \nWhole herds of offer'd bulls, about the fire, \nAnd bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire. \nAround the piles a careful troop attends, \nTo watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;\n\nLing'ring along the shore, till dewy night \nNew decks the face of heav'n with starry light. \nThe conquer'd Latians, with like pious care, \nPiles without number for their dead prepare. \nPart in the places where they fell are laid; \nAnd part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd. \nThe corps of kings, and captains of renown, \nBorne off in state, are buried in the town; \nThe rest, unhonor'd, and without a name, \nAre cast a common heap to feed the flame. \nTrojans and Latians vie with like desires \nTo make the field of battle shine with fires, \nAnd the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires. \nNow had the morning thrice renew'd the light, \nAnd thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night, \nWhen those who round the wasted fires remain, \nPerform the last sad office to the slain. \nThey rake the yet warm ashes from below; \nThese, and the bones unburn'd, in earth bestow; \nThese relics with their country rites they grace, \nAnd raise a mount of turf to mark the place. \nBut, in the palace of the king, appears \nA scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears. \nMaids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans; \nOrphans their sires, and sires lament their sons. \nAll in that universal sorrow share, \nAnd curse the cause of this unhappy war: \nA broken league, a bride unjustly sought, \nA crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought! \nThese are the crimes with which they load the name \nOf Turnus, and on him alone exclaim: \n\"Let him who lords it o'er th' Ausonian land \nEngage the Trojan hero hand to hand: \nHis is the gain; our lot is but to serve; \n'T is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve.\" \nThis Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite: \n\"His foe expects, and dares him to the fight.\" \nNor Turnus wants a party, to support \nHis cause and credit in the Latian court. \nHis former acts secure his present fame, \nAnd the queen shades him with her mighty name. \nWhile thus their factious minds with fury burn, \nThe legates from th' Aetolian prince return: \nSad news they bring, that, after all the cost \nAnd care employ'd, their embassy is lost; \nThat Diomedes refus'd his aid in war, \nUnmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r. \nSome new alliance must elsewhere be sought, \nOr peace with Troy on hard conditions bought. \nLatinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late, \nA foreign son is pointed out by fate; \nAnd, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed, \nThe wrath of Heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head. \nThe gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side, \nWhen late their titles in the field were tried: \nWitness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried. \nThus, full of anxious thought, he summons all \nThe Latian senate to the council hall. \nThe princes come, commanded by their head, \nAnd crowd the paths that to the palace lead. \nSupreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his years, \nHe takes the throne, and in the midst appears. \nMajestically sad, he sits in state, \nAnd bids his envoys their success relate. \nWhen Venulus began, the murmuring sound \nWas hush'd, and sacred silence reign'd around. \n\"We have,\" said he, \"perform'd your high command, \nAnd pass'd with peril a long tract of land: \nWe reach'd the place desir'd; with wonder fill'd, \nThe Grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld. \nGreat Diomede has compass'd round with walls \nThe city, which Argyripa he calls, \nFrom his own Argos nam'd. We touch'd, with joy, \nThe royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy. \nWhen introduc'd, our presents first we bring, \nThen crave an instant audience from the king. \nHis leave obtain'd, our native soil we name, \nAnd tell th' important cause for which we came. \nAttentively he heard us, while we spoke; \nThen, with soft accents, and a pleasing look, \nMade this return: 'Ausonian race, of old \nRenown'd for peace, and for an age of gold, \nWhat madness has your alter'd minds possess'd, \nTo change for war hereditary rest, \nSolicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword, \nA needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd? \nWe- for myself I speak, and all the name \nOf Grecians, who to Troy's destruction came, \nOmitting those who were in battle slain, \nOr borne by rolling Simois to the main- \nNot one but suffer'd, and too dearly bought \nThe prize of honor which in arms he sought; \nSome doom'd to death, and some in exile driv'n. \nOutcasts, abandon'd by the care of Heav'n; \nSo worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew, \nAs ev'n old Priam might with pity view. \nWitness the vessels by Minerva toss'd \nIn storms; the vengeful Capharean coast; \nTh' Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led \nOur armies to revenge his injur'd bed, \nIn Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men \nHave seen Charybdis and the Cyclops' den. \nWhy should I name Idomeneus, in vain \nRestor'd to scepters, and expell'd again? \nOr young Achilles, by his rival slain? \nEv'n he, the King of Men, the foremost name \nOf all the Greeks, and most renown'd by fame, \nThe proud revenger of another's wife, \nYet by his own adult'ress lost his life; \nFell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy \nThe foul polluters of his bed enjoy. \nThe gods have envied me the sweets of life, \nMy much lov'd country, and my more lov'd wife: \nBanish'd from both, I mourn; while in the sky, \nTransform'd to birds, my lost companions fly: \nHov'ring about the coasts, they make their moan, \nAnd cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own. \nWhat squalid specters, in the dead of night, \nBreak my short sleep, and skim before my sight! \nI might have promis'd to myself those harms, \nMad as I was, when I, with mortal arms, \nPresum'd against immortal pow'rs to move, \nAnd violate with wounds the Queen of Love. \nSuch arms this hand shall never more employ; \nNo hate remains with me to ruin'd Troy. \nI war not with its dust; nor am I glad \nTo think of past events, or good or bad. \nYour presents I return: whate'er you bring \nTo buy my friendship, send the Trojan king. \nWe met in fight; I know him, to my cost: \nWith what a whirling force his lance he toss'd! \nHeav'ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw! \nHow high he held his shield, and rose at ev'ry blow! \nHad Troy produc'd two more his match in might, \nThey would have chang'd the fortune of the fight: \nTh' invasion of the Greeks had been return'd, \nOur empire wasted, and our cities burn'd. \nThe long defense the Trojan people made, \nThe war protracted, and the siege delay'd, \nWere due to Hector's and this hero's hand: \nBoth brave alike, and equal in command; \nAeneas, not inferior in the field, \nIn pious reverence to the gods excell'd. \nMake peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care \nTh' impending dangers of a fatal war.' \nHe said no more; but, with this cold excuse, \nRefus'd th' alliance, and advis'd a truce.\" \nThus Venulus concluded his report. \nA jarring murmur fill'd the factious court: \nAs, when a torrent rolls with rapid force, \nAnd dashes o'er the stones that stop the course, \nThe flood, constrain'd within a scanty space, \nRoars horrible along th' uneasy race; \nWhite foam in gath'ring eddies floats around; \nThe rocky shores rebellow to the sound. \nThe murmur ceas'd: then from his lofty throne \nThe king invok'd the gods, and thus begun: \n\"I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate \nHad been resolv'd before it was too late. \nMuch better had it been for you and me, \nUnforc'd by this our last necessity, \nTo have been earlier wise, than now to call \nA council, when the foe surrounds the wall. \nO citizens, we wage unequal war, \nWith men not only Heav'n's peculiar care, \nBut Heav'n's own race; unconquer'd in the field, \nOr, conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield. \nWhat hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down: \nOur hopes must center on ourselves alone. \nYet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain, \nYou see too well; nor need my words explain. \nVanquish'd without resource; laid flat by fate; \nFactions within, a foe without the gate! \nNot but I grant that all perform'd their parts \nWith manly force, and with undaunted hearts: \nWith our united strength the war we wag'd; \nWith equal numbers, equal arms, engag'd. \nYou see th' event.- Now hear what I propose, \nTo save our friends, and satisfy our foes. \nA tract of land the Latins have possess'd \nAlong the Tiber, stretching to the west, \nWhich now Rutulians and Auruncans till, \nAnd their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill. \nThose mountains fill'd with firs, that lower land, \nIf you consent, the Trojan shall command, \nCall'd into part of what is ours; and there, \nOn terms agreed, the common country share. \nThere let'em build and settle, if they please; \nUnless they choose once more to cross the seas, \nIn search of seats remote from Italy, \nAnd from unwelcome inmates set us free. \nThen twice ten galleys let us build with speed, \nOr twice as many more, if more they need. \nMaterials are at hand; a well-grown wood \nRuns equal with the margin of the flood: \nLet them the number and the form assign; \nThe care and cost of all the stores be mine. \nTo treat the peace, a hundred senators \nShall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs, \nWith olive the presents they shall bear, \nA purple robe, a royal iv'ry chair, \nAnd all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear, \nAnd sums of gold. Among yourselves debate \nThis great affair, and save the sinking state.\" \nThen Drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since, \nThe rising glories of the Daunian prince. \nFactious and rich, bold at the council board, \nBut cautious in the field, he shunn'd the sword; \nA close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord. \nNoble his mother was, and near the throne; \nBut, what his father's parentage, unknown. \nHe rose, and took th' advantage of the times, \nTo load young Turnus with invidious crimes. \n\"Such truths, O king,\" said he, \"your words contain, \nAs strike the sense, and all replies are vain; \nNor are your loyal subjects now to seek \nWhat common needs require, but fear to speak. \nLet him give leave of speech, that haughty man, \nWhose pride this unauspicious war began; \nFor whose ambition (let me dare to say, \nFear set apart, tho' death is in my way) \nThe plains of Latium run with blood around. \nSo many valiant heroes bite the ground; \nDejected grief in ev'ry face appears; \nA town in mourning, and a land in tears; \nWhile he, th' undoubted author of our harms, \nThe man who menaces the gods with arms, \nYet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight, \nAnd sought his safety in ignoble flight. \nNow, best of kings, since you propose to send \nSuch bounteous presents to your Trojan friend; \nAdd yet a greater at our joint request, \nOne which he values more than all the rest: \nGive him the fair Lavinia for his bride; \nWith that alliance let the league be tied, \nAnd for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide. \nLet insolence no longer awe the throne; \nBut, with a father's right, bestow your own. \nFor this maligner of the general good, \nIf still we fear his force, he must be woo'd; \nHis haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore, \nYour scepter to release, and our just rights restore. \nO cursed cause of all our ills, must we \nWage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee! \nWhat right hast thou to rule the Latian state, \nAnd send us out to meet our certain fate? \n'T is a destructive war: from Turnus' hand \nOur peace and public safety we demand. \nLet the fair bride to the brave chief remain; \nIf not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain. \nTurnus, I know you think me not your friend, \nNor will I much with your belief contend: \nI beg your greatness not to give the law \nIn others' realms, but, beaten, to withdraw. \nPity your own, or pity our estate; \nNor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate. \nYour interest is, the war should never cease; \nBut we have felt enough to wish the peace: \nA land exhausted to the last remains, \nDepopulated towns, and driven plains. \nYet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow'r, \nA beauteous princess, with a crown in dow'r, \nSo fire your mind, in arms assert your right, \nAnd meet your foe, who dares you to the fight. \nMankind, it seems, is made for you alone; \nWe, but the slaves who mount you to the throne: \nA base ignoble crowd, without a name, \nUnwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame, \nBy duty bound to forfeit each his life, \nThat Turnus may possess a royal wife. \nPermit not, mighty man, so mean a crew \nShould share such triumphs, and detain from you \nThe post of honor, your undoubted due. \nRather alone your matchless force employ, \nTo merit what alone you must enjoy.\" \nThese words, so full of malice mix'd with art, \nInflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart. \nThen, groaning from the bottom of his breast, \nHe heav'd for wind, and thus his wrath express'd: \n\"You, Drances, never want a stream of words, \nThen, when the public need requires our swords. \nFirst in the council hall to steer the state, \nAnd ever foremost in a tongue-debate, \nWhile our strong walls secure us from the foe, \nEre yet with blood our ditches overflow: \nBut let the potent orator declaim, \nAnd with the brand of coward blot my name; \nFree leave is giv'n him, when his fatal hand \nHas cover'd with more corps the sanguine strand, \nAnd high as mine his tow'ring trophies stand. \nIf any doubt remains, who dares the most, \nLet us decide it at the Trojan's cost, \nAnd issue both abreast, where honor calls- \nFoes are not far to seek without the walls- \nUnless his noisy tongue can only fight, \nAnd feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight. \nI beaten from the field? I forc'd away? \nWho, but so known a dastard, dares to say? \nHad he but ev'n beheld the fight, his eyes \nHad witness'd for me what his tongue denies: \nWhat heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain, \nAnd how the bloody Tiber swell'd the main. \nAll saw, but he, th' Arcadian troops retire \nIn scatter'd squadrons, and their prince expire. \nThe giant brothers, in their camp, have found, \nI was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground. \nNot such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos'd, \nI singly their united arms oppos'd: \nFirst forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array; \nThen, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way. \n'T is a destructive war? So let it be, \nBut to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee! \nMeantime proceed to fill the people's ears \nWith false reports, their minds with panic fears: \nExtol the strength of a twice-conquer'd race; \nOur foes encourage, and our friends debase. \nBelieve thy fables, and the Trojan town \nTriumphant stands; the Grecians are o'erthrown; \nSuppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies, \nAnd Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies. \nSay rapid Aufidus with awful dread \nRuns backward from the sea, and hides his head, \nWhen the great Trojan on his bank appears; \nFor that's as true as thy dissembled fears \nOf my revenge. Dismiss that vanity: \nThou, Drances, art below a death from me. \nLet that vile soul in that vile body rest; \nThe lodging is well worthy of the guest. \n\"Now, royal father, to the present state \nOf our affairs, and of this high debate: \nIf in your arms thus early you diffide, \nAnd think your fortune is already tried; \nIf one defeat has brought us down so low, \nAs never more in fields to meet the foe; \nThen I conclude for peace: 't is time to treat, \nAnd lie like vassals at the victor's feet. \nBut, O! if any ancient blood remains, \nOne drop of all our fathers', in our veins, \nThat man would I prefer before the rest, \nWho dar'd his death with an undaunted breast; \nWho comely fell, by no dishonest wound, \nTo shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw'd the ground. \nBut, if we still have fresh recruits in store, \nIf our confederates can afford us more; \nIf the contended field we bravely fought, \nAnd not a bloodless victory was bought; \nTheir losses equal'd ours; and, for their slain, \nWith equal fires they fill'd the shining plain; \nWhy thus, unforc'd, should we so tamely yield, \nAnd, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field? \nGood unexpected, evils unforeseen, \nAppear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene: \nSome, rais'd aloft, come tumbling down amain; \nThen fall so hard, they bound and rise again. \nIf Diomede refuse his aid to lend, \nThe great Messapus yet remains our friend: \nTolumnius, who foretells events, is ours; \nTh' Italian chiefs and princes join their pow'rs: \nNor least in number, nor in name the last, \nYour own brave subjects have your cause embrac'd \nAbove the rest, the Volscian Amazon \nContains an army in herself alone, \nAnd heads a squadron, terrible to sight, \nWith glitt'ring shields, in brazen armor bright. \nYet, if the foe a single fight demand, \nAnd I alone the public peace withstand; \nIf you consent, he shall not be refus'd, \nNor find a hand to victory unus'd. \nThis new Achilles, let him take the field, \nWith fated armor, and Vulcanian shield! \nFor you, my royal father, and my fame, \nI, Turnus, not the least of all my name, \nDevote my soul. He calls me hand to hand, \nAnd I alone will answer his demand. \nDrances shall rest secure, and neither share \nThe danger, nor divide the prize of war.\" \nWhile they debate, nor these nor those will yield, \nAeneas draws his forces to the field, \nAnd moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed \nReturn, and thro' the frighted city spread \nTh' unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried, \nIn battle marching by the river side, \nAnd bending to the town. They take th' alarm: \nSome tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm. \nTh' impetuous youth press forward to the field; \nThey clash the sword, and clatter on the shield: \nThe fearful matrons raise a screaming cry; \nOld feeble men with fainter groans reply; \nA jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky, \nLike that of swans remurm'ring to the floods, \nOr birds of diff'ring kinds in hollow woods. \nTurnus th' occasion takes, and cries aloud: \n\"Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd: \nDeclaim in praise of peace, when danger calls, \nAnd the fierce foes in arms approach the walls.\" \nHe said, and, turning short, with speedy pace, \nCasts back a scornful glance, and quits the place: \n\"Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command \nTo mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band. \nMessapus and Catillus, post your force \nAlong the fields, to charge the Trojan horse. \nSome guard the passes, others man the wall; \nDrawn up in arms, the rest attend my call.\" \nThey swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town, \nAnd with disorder'd haste the rampires crown. \nGood old Latinus, when he saw, too late, \nThe gath'ring storm just breaking on the state, \nDismiss'd the council till a fitter time, \nAnd own'd his easy temper as his crime, \nWho, forc'd against his reason, had complied \nTo break the treaty for the promis'd bride. \nSome help to sink new trenches; others aid \nTo ram the stones, or raise the palisade. \nHoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls \nRuns a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls. \nA sad procession in the streets is seen, \nOf matrons, that attend the mother queen: \nHigh in her chair she sits, and, at her side, \nWith downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride. \nThey mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands; \nPray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands, \nWith censers first they fume the sacred shrine, \nThen in this common supplication join: \n\"O patroness of arms, unspotted maid, \nPropitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid! \nBreak short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate, \nAnd lay the Phrygian low before the gate.\" \nNow Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast \nWell-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest: \nThe cuishes which his brawny thighs infold \nAre mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold. \nHis faithful fauchion sits upon his side; \nNor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide: \nBut, bare to view, amid surrounding friends, \nWith godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends. \nExulting in his strength, he seems to dare \nHis absent rival, and to promise war. \nFreed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins, \nThe wanton courser prances o'er the plains, \nOr in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds, \nAnd snuffs the females in forbidden grounds. \nOr seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood, \nTo quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood: \nHe swims luxuriant in the liquid plain, \nAnd o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane: \nHe neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high; \nBefore his ample chest the frothy waters fly. \nSoon as the prince appears without the gate, \nThe Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait \nHis last commands. Then, with a graceful mien, \nLights from her lofty steed the warrior queen: \nHer squadron imitates, and each descends; \nWhose common suit Camilla thus commends: \n\"If sense of honor, if a soul secure \nOf inborn worth, that can all tests endure, \nCan promise aught, or on itself rely \nGreatly to dare, to conquer or to die; \nThen, I alone, sustain'd by these, will meet \nThe Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat. \nOurs be the danger, ours the sole renown: \nYou, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town:\" \nTurnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise, \nAnd on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes; \nThen thus return'd: \"O grace of Italy, \nWith what becoming thanks can I reply? \nNot only words lie lab'ring in my breast, \nBut thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd. \nYet rob me not of all; but let me join \nMy toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine. \nThe Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd, \nSends his light horse before to scour the field: \nHimself, thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes, \nA larger compass to the city takes. \nThis news my scouts confirm, and I prepare \nTo foil his cunning, and his force to dare; \nWith chosen foot his passage to forelay, \nAnd place an ambush in the winding way. \nThou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse; \nThe brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce \nWith those of Tibur, and the Latian band, \nSubjected all to thy supreme command.\" \nThis said, he warns Messapus to the war, \nThen ev'ry chief exhorts with equal care. \nAll thus encourag'd, his own troops he joins, \nAnd hastes to prosecute his deep designs. \nInclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies, \nBy nature form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise. \nA narrow track, by human steps untrode, \nLeads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode. \nHigh o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands, \nWhence the surveying sight the nether ground commands. \nThe top is level, an offensive seat \nOf war; and from the war a safe retreat: \nFor, on the right and left, is room to press \nThe foes at hand, or from afar distress; \nTo drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour \nOn their descending backs a stony show'r. \nThither young Turnus took the well-known way, \nPossess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay. \nMeantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies, \nBeheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes, \nAnd call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid, \nHer most belov'd and ever-trusty maid; \nThen with a sigh began: \"Camilla goes \nTo meet her death amidst her fatal foes: \nThe nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train, \nInvested with Diana's arms, in vain. \nNor is my kindness for the virgin new: \n'T was born with her; and with her years it grew. \nHer father Metabus, when forc'd away \nFrom old Privernum, for tyrannic sway, \nSnatch'd up, and sav'd from his prevailing foes, \nThis tender babe, companion of his woes. \nCasmilla was her mother; but he drown'd \nOne hissing letter in a softer sound, \nAnd call'd Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies; \nWrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies. \nHis foes in sight, he mends his weary pace; \nWith shout and clamors they pursue the chase. \nThe banks of Amasene at length he gains: \nThe raging flood his farther flight restrains, \nRais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains. \nPrepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears, \nNot for himself, but for the charge he bears. \nAnxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste; \nThen, desp'rate in distress, resolves at last. \nA knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore; \nThe middle part with cork he cover'd o'er: \nHe clos'd the child within the hollow space; \nWith twigs of bending osier bound the case; \nThen pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight, \nAnd thus invok'd my favor for the freight: \n'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said, \n'Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid! \nThro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine; \nAnd the first weapons that she knows, are thine.' \nHe said; and with full force the spear he threw: \nAbove the sounding waves Camilla flew. \nThen, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide, \nAnd gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side. \nHis fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground, \nAnd, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound; \nNor, after that, in towns which walls inclose, \nWould trust his hunted life amidst his foes; \nBut, rough, in open air he chose to lie; \nEarth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky. \nOn hills unshorn, or in a desart den, \nHe shunn'd the dire society of men. \nA shepherd's solitary life he led; \nHis daughter with the milk of mares he fed. \nThe dugs of bears, and ev'ry salvage beast, \nHe drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd. \nThe little Amazon could scarcely go: \nHe loads her with a quiver and a bow; \nAnd, that she might her stagg'ring steps command, \nHe with a slender jav'lin fills her hand. \nHer flowing hair no golden fillet bound; \nNor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground. \nInstead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread \nHer back and shoulders, fasten'd to her head. \nThe flying dart she first attempts to fling, \nAnd round her tender temples toss'd the sling; \nThen, as her strength with years increas'd, began \nTo pierce aloft in air the soaring swan, \nAnd from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane. \nThe Tuscan matrons with each other vied, \nTo bless their rival sons with such a bride; \nBut she disdains their love, to share with me \nThe sylvan shades and vow'd virginity. \nAnd, O! I wish, contented with my cares \nOf salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars! \nThen had she been of my celestial train, \nAnd shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain. \nBut since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes \nTo find her death among forbidden foes, \nHaste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight. \nWhere, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight. \nThis bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath, \nThis chosen arrow, to revenge her death: \nBy whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain, \nOr of the Trojan or Italian train, \nLet him not pass unpunish'd from the plain. \nThen, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid \nTo bear the breathless body of my maid: \nUnspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd \nHer holy limbs with any human hand, \nAnd in a marble tomb laid in her native land.\" \nShe said. The faithful nymph descends from high \nWith rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky: \nBlack clouds and stormy winds around her body fly. \nBy this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse, \nDrawn up in squadrons, with united force, \nApproach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound, \nPress forward on their bits, and shift their ground. \nShields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far; \nAnd the fields glitter with a waving war. \nOppos'd to these, come on with furious force \nMessapus, Coras, and the Latian horse; \nThese in the body plac'd, on either hand \nSustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band. \nAdvancing in a line, they couch their spears; \nAnd less and less the middle space appears. \nThick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen \nThe neighing coursers, and the shouting men. \nIn distance of their darts they stop their course; \nThen man to man they rush, and horse to horse. \nThe face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide, \nAnd deaths unseen are dealt on either side. \nTyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear, \nBy mettled coursers borne in full career, \nMeet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock, \nTheir horses' heads against each other knock. \nFar from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast, \nAs with an engine's force, or lightning's blast: \nHe rolls along in blood, and breathes his last. \nThe Latin squadrons take a sudden fright, \nAnd sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight\n\nSpurring at speed to their own walls they drew; \nClose in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue, \nAnd urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase; \nTill, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face, \nReceive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry. \nThe Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly. \nSo swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar, \nDriv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore, \nBound o'er the rocks, incroach upon the land, \nAnd far upon the beach eject the sand; \nThen backward, with a swing, they take their way, \nRepuls'd from upper ground, and seek their mother sea; \nWith equal hurry quit th' invaded shore, \nAnd swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before.\n\nTwice were the Tuscans masters of the field, \nTwice by the Latins, in their turn, repell'd. \nAsham'd at length, to the third charge they ran; \nBoth hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man. \nNow dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd \nWith falling bodies, and are drunk with blood. \nArms, horses, men, on heaps together lie: \nConfus'd the fight, and more confus'd the cry. \nOrsilochus, who durst not press too near \nStrong Remulus, at distance drove his spear, \nAnd stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear. \nThe fiery steed, impatient of the wound, \nCurvets, and, springing upward with a bound, \nHis helpless lord cast backward on the ground. \nCatillus pierc'd Iolas first; then drew \nHis reeking lance, and at Herminius threw, \nThe mighty champion of the Tuscan crew. \nHis neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare, \nBut shaded with a length of yellow hair: \nSecure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part, \nA spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart. \nAcross the shoulders came the feather'd wound; \nTransfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground. \nThe sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed, \nAnd death with honor sought on either side. \nResistless thro' the war Camilla rode, \nIn danger unappall'd, and pleas'd with blood. \nOne side was bare for her exerted breast; \nOne shoulder with her painted quiver press'd. \nNow from afar her fatal jav'lins play; \nNow with her ax's edge she hews her way: \nDiana's arms upon her shoulder sound; \nAnd when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground, \nFrom her bent bow she sends a backward wound. \nHer maids, in martial pomp, on either side, \nLarina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride: \nItalians all; in peace, their queen's delight; \nIn war, the bold companions of the fight. \nSo march'd the Tracian Amazons of old, \nWhen Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd: \nSuch troops as these in shining arms were seen, \nWhen Theseus met in fight their maiden queen: \nSuch to the field Penthisilea led, \nFrom the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled; \nWith such, return'd triumphant from the war, \nHer maids with cries attend the lofty car; \nThey clash with manly force their moony shields; \nWith female shouts resound the Phrygian fields. \nWho foremost, and who last, heroic maid, \nOn the cold earth were by thy courage laid? \nThy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first, \nWith fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd: \nA purple stream came spouting from the wound; \nBath'd in his blood he lies, and bites the ground. \nLiris and Pegasus at once she slew: \nThe former, as the slacken'd reins he drew \nOf his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch'd \nHis arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd. \nBy the same weapon, sent from the same hand, \nBoth fall together, and both spurn the sand. \nAmastrus next is added to the slain: \nThe rest in rout she follows o'er the plain: \nTereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon, \nAnd Chromis, at full speed her fury shun. \nOf all her deadly darts, not one she lost; \nEach was attended with a Trojan ghost. \nYoung Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed, \nSwift for the chase, and of Apulian breed. \nHim from afar she spied, in arms unknown: \nO'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown; \nHis helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread \nA cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his head, \nHe clench'd within his hand an iron prong, \nAnd tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng. \nHim soon she singled from the flying train, \nAnd slew with ease; then thus insults the slain: \n\"Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase \nThe savage herd, a vile and trembling race? \nHere cease thy vaunts, and own my victory: \nA woman warrior was too strong for thee. \nYet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name, \nConfessing great Camilla, save thy shame.\" \nThen Butes and Orsilochus she slew, \nThe bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew; \nBut Butes breast to breast: the spear descends \nAbove the gorget, where his helmet ends, \nAnd o'er the shield which his left side defends. \nOrsilochus and she their courses ply: \nHe seems to follow, and she seems to fly; \nBut in a narrower ring she makes the race; \nAnd then he flies, and she pursues the chase. \nGath'ring at length on her deluded foe, \nShe swings her ax, and rises to the blow \nFull on the helm behind, with such a sway \nThe weapon falls, the riven steel gives way: \nHe groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace; \nBrains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face. \nAstonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance, \nTo see his fall; nor farther dares advance; \nBut, fixing on the horrid maid his eye, \nHe stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly; \nYet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat, \n(At least while fortune favor'd his deceit,) \nCries out aloud: \"What courage have you shown, \nWho trust your courser's strength, and not your own? \nForego the vantage of your horse, alight, \nAnd then on equal terms begin the fight: \nIt shall be seen, weak woman, what you can, \nWhen, foot to foot, you combat with a man,\" \nHe said. She glows with anger and disdain, \nDismounts with speed to dare him on the plain, \nAnd leaves her horse at large among her train; \nWith her drawn sword defies him to the field, \nAnd, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield. \nThe youth, who thought his cunning did succeed, \nReins round his horse, and urges all his speed; \nAdds the remembrance of the spur, and hides \nThe goring rowels in his bleeding sides. \n\"Vain fool, and coward!\" cries the lofty maid, \n\"Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid! \nOn others practice thy Ligurian arts; \nThin stratagems and tricks of little hearts \nAre lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire, \nWith vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire.\" \nAt this, so fast her flying feet she sped, \nThat soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head: \nThen turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein, \nAnd laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain. \nNot with more ease the falcon, from above, \nTrusses in middle air the trembling dove, \nThen plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound: \nThe feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground.\n\nNow mighty Jove, from his superior height, \nWith his broad eye surveys th' unequal fight. \nHe fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain, \nAnd sends him to redeem th' abandon'd plain. \nBetwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides, \nAnd these encourages, and those he chides; \nRecalls each leader, by his name, from flight; \nRenews their ardor, and restores the fight. \n\"What panic fear has seiz'd your souls? O shame, \nO brand perpetual of th' Etrurian name! \nCowards incurable, a woman's hand \nDrives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band! \nNow cast away the sword, and quit the shield! \nWhat use of weapons which you dare not wield? \nNot thus you fly your female foes by night, \nNor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite; \nWhen to fat off'rings the glad augur calls, \nAnd the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals. \nThese are your studied cares, your lewd delight: \nSwift to debauch, but slow to manly fight.\" \nThus having said, he spurs amid the foes, \nNot managing the life he meant to lose. \nThe first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste, \nIn his strong gripe, and clasp'd around the waist; \n'T was Venulus, whom from his horse he tore, \nAnd, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore. \nLoud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes, \nAnd view th' unusual sight with vast surprise. \nThe fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains, \nPress'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains; \nThen, with his shorten'd spear, explores around \nHis jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound. \nNor less the captive struggles for his life: \nHe writhes his body to prolong the strife, \nAnd, fencing for his naked throat, exerts \nHis utmost vigor, and the point averts. \nSo stoops the yellow eagle from on high, \nAnd bears a speckled serpent thro' the sky, \nFast'ning his crooked talons on the prey: \nThe pris'ner hisses thro' the liquid way; \nResists the royal hawk; and, tho' oppress'd, \nShe fights in volumes, and erects her crest: \nTurn'd to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale, \nAnd shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat'ning tail.\n\nAgainst the victor, all defense is weak: \nTh' imperial bird still plies her with his beak; \nHe tears her bowels, and her breast he gores; \nThen claps his pinions, and securely soars. \nThus, thro' the midst of circling enemies, \nStrong Tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize. \nThe Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press \nThe Latins, and presume the like success. \nThen Aruns, doom'd to death, his arts assay'd, \nTo murther, unespied, the Volscian maid: \nThis way and that his winding course he bends, \nAnd, whereso'er she turns, her steps attends. \nWhen she retires victorious from the chase, \nHe wheels about with care, and shifts his place; \nWhen, rushing on, she seeks her foes flight, \nHe keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight: \nHe threats, and trembles, trying ev'ry way, \nUnseen to kill, and safely to betray. \nChloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far, \nGlitt'ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war, \nWas by the virgin view'd. The steed he press'd \nWas proud with trappings, and his brawny chest \nWith scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er; \nA robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore. \nWith deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe; \nGnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow: \nA golden helm his front and head surrounds \nA gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds. \nGold, weav'd with linen, on his thighs he wore, \nWith flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er, \nWith golden buckles bound, and gather'd up before. \nHim the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes, \nFond and ambitious of so rich a prize, \nOr that the temple might his trophies hold, \nOr else to shine herself in Trojan gold. \nBlind in her haste, she chases him alone. \nAnd seeks his life, regardless of her own. \nThis lucky moment the sly traitor chose: \nThen, starting from his ambush, up he rose, \nAnd threw, but first to Heav'n address'd his vows: \n\"O patron of Socrates' high abodes, \nPhoebus, the ruling pow'r among the gods, \nWhom first we serve, whole woods of unctuous pine \nAre fell'd for thee, and to thy glory shine; \nBy thee protected with our naked soles, \nThro' flames unsing'd we march, and tread the kindled coals\n\nGive me, propitious pow'r, to wash away \nThe stains of this dishonorable day: \nNor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim, \nBut with my future actions trust my fame. \nLet me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome, \nAnd from the field return inglorious home.\" \nApollo heard, and, granting half his pray'r, \nShuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty air. \nHe gives the death desir'd; his safe return \nBy southern tempests to the seas is borne. \nNow, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies, \nBoth armies on Camilla turn'd their eyes, \nDirected by the sound. Of either host, \nTh' unhappy virgin, tho' concern'd the most, \nWas only deaf; so greedy was she bent \nOn golden spoils, and on her prey intent; \nTill in her pap the winged weapon stood \nInfix'd, and deeply drunk the purple blood. \nHer sad attendants hasten to sustain \nTheir dying lady, drooping on the plain. \nFar from their sight the trembling Aruns flies, \nWith beating heart, and fear confus'd with joys; \nNor dares he farther to pursue his blow, \nOr ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe. \nAs, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide \nAt unawares, or ranch'd a shepherd's side, \nConscious of his audacious deed, he flies, \nAnd claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs: \nSo, speeding once, the wretch no more attends, \nBut, spurring forward, herds among his friends. \nShe wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands, \nBut wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands; \nThe wood she draws, the steely point remains; \nShe staggers in her seat with agonizing pains: \n(A gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes, \nAnd from her cheeks the rosy color flies:) \nThen turns to her, whom of her female train \nShe trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain: \n\"Acca, 't is past! he swims before my sight, \nInexorable Death; and claims his right. \nBear my last words to Turnus; fly with speed, \nAnd bid him timely to my charge succeed, \nRepel the Trojans, and the town relieve: \nFarewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive.\" \nShe said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain: \nDying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein; \nShort, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees \nHer mind the passage from her body frees. \nShe drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest, \nHer drooping head declining on her breast: \nIn the last sigh her struggling soul expires, \nAnd, murm'ring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires. \nA shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued; \nDespair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd. \nThe Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line, \nAdvance to charge; the mix'd Arcadians join. \nBut Cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar \nSurveys the field, and fortune of the war, \nUnmov'd a while, till, prostrate on the plain, \nWelt'ring in blood, she sees Camilla slain, \nAnd, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train.\n\nThen, from the bottom of her breast, she drew \nA mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue: \n\"Too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid, \nFor warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid! \nNor aught avail'd, in this unhappy strife, \nDiana's sacred arms, to save thy life. \nYet unreveng'd thy goddess will not leave \nHer vot'ry's death, nor; with vain sorrow grieve. \nBranded the wretch, and be his name abhorr'd; \nBut after ages shall thy praise record. \nTh' inglorious coward soon shall press the plain: \nThus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain.\" \nHigh o'er the field there stood a hilly mound, \nSacred the place, and spread with oaks around, \nWhere, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay, \nA king that once in Latium bore the sway. \nThe beauteous Opis thither bent her flight, \nTo mark the traitor Aruns from the height. \nHim in refulgent arms she soon espied, \nSwoln with success; and loudly thus she cried: \n\"Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late; \nTurn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate. \nCharg'd with my message, to Camilla go, \nAnd say I sent thee to the shades below, \nAn honor undeserv'd from Cynthia's bow.\" \nShe said, and from her quiver chose with speed \nThe winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed; \nThen to the stubborn yew her strength applied, \nTill the far distant horns approach'd on either side. \nThe bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she drew; \nWhizzing in air the fatal arrow flew. \nAt once the twanging bow and sounding dart \nThe traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart. \nHim, beating with his heels in pangs of death, \nHis flying friends to foreign fields bequeath. \nThe conqu'ring damsel, with expanded wings, \nThe welcome message to her mistress brings. \nTheir leader lost, the Volscians quit the field, \nAnd, unsustain'd, the chiefs of Turnus yield. \nThe frighted soldiers, when their captains fly, \nMore on their speed than on their strength rely. \nConfus'd in flight, they bear each other down, \nAnd spur their horses headlong to the town. \nDriv'n by their foes, and to their fears resign'd, \nNot once they turn, but take their wounds behind. \nThese drop the shield, and those the lance forego, \nOr on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow. \nThe hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound, \nBeat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground. \nBlack clouds of dust come rolling in the sky, \nAnd o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly. \nThe trembling matrons, from their lofty stands, \nRend heav'n with female shrieks, and wring their hands. \nAll pressing on, pursuers and pursued, \nAre crush'd in crowds, a mingled multitude. \nSome happy few escape: the throng too late \nRush on for entrance, till they choke the gate. \nEv'n in the sight of home, the wretched sire \nLooks on, and sees his helpless son expire. \nThen, in a fright, the folding gates they close, \nBut leave their friends excluded with their foes. \nThe vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout; \n'T is terror all within, and slaughter all without. \nBlind in their fear, they bounce against the wall, \nOr, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall. \nThe Latian virgins, valiant with despair, \nArm'd on the tow'rs, the common danger share: \nSo much of zeal their country's cause inspir'd; \nSo much Camilla's great example fir'd. \nPoles, sharpen'd in the flames, from high they throw, \nWith imitated darts, to gall the foe. \nTheir lives for godlike freedom they bequeath, \nAnd crowd each other to be first in death. \nMeantime to Turnus, ambush'd in the shade, \nWith heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid: \n\"The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill'd; \nThe foes, entirely masters of the field, \nLike a resistless flood, come rolling on: \nThe cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town.\" \nInflam'd with rage, (for so the Furies fire \nThe Daunian's breast, and so the Fates require,) \nHe leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain \nPossess'd, and downward issues on the plain. \nScarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed \nFrom secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. \nThro' the black forest and the ferny brake, \nUnknowingly secure, their way they take; \nFrom the rough mountains to the plain descend, \nAnd there, in order drawn, their line extend. \nBoth armies now in open fields are seen; \nNor far the distance of the space between. \nBoth to the city bend. Aeneas sees, \nThro' smoking fields, his hast'ning enemies; \nAnd Turnus views the Trojans in array, \nAnd hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh. \nSoon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd; \nBut westward to the sea the sun declin'd. \nIntrench'd before the town both armies lie, \nWhile Night with sable wings involves the sky. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK XII\n\nWhen Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, \nTheir armies broken, and their courage quell'd, \nHimself become the mark of public spite, \nHis honor question'd for the promis'd fight; \nThe more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd, \nThe more his fury boil'd within his breast: \nHe rous'd his vigor for the last debate, \nAnd rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate. \nAs, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, \nHe makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; \nBut, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side, \nThe lordly beast returns with double pride: \nHe wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; \nHis sides he lashes, and erects his mane: \nSo Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, \nThro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. \nTrembling with rage, around the court he ran, \nAt length approach'd the king, and thus began: \n\"No more excuses or delays: I stand \nIn arms prepar'd to combat, hand to hand, \nThis base deserter of his native land. \nThe Trojan, by his word, is bound to take \nThe same conditions which himself did make. \nRenew the truce; the solemn rites prepare, \nAnd to my single virtue trust the war. \nThe Latians unconcern'd shall see the fight; \nThis arm unaided shall assert your right: \nThen, if my prostrate body press the plain, \nTo him the crown and beauteous bride remain.\" \nTo whom the king sedately thus replied: \n\"Brave youth, the more your valor has been tried, \nThe more becomes it us, with due respect, \nTo weigh the chance of war, which you neglect. \nYou want not wealth, or a successive throne, \nOr cities which your arms have made your own: \nMy towns and treasures are at your command, \nAnd stor'd with blooming beauties is my land; \nLaurentum more than one Lavinia sees, \nUnmarried, fair, of noble families. \nNow let me speak, and you with patience hear, \nThings which perhaps may grate a lover's ear, \nBut sound advice, proceeding from a heart \nSincerely yours, and free from fraudful art. \nThe gods, by signs, have manifestly shown, \nNo prince Italian born should heir my throne: \nOft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd, \nAnd oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd. \nYet, won by worth that cannot be withstood, \nBrib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood, \nUrg'd by my wife, who would not be denied, \nI promis'd my Lavinia for your bride: \nHer from her plighted lord by force I took; \nAll ties of treaties, and of honor, broke: \nOn your account I wag'd an impious war- \nWith what success, 't is needless to declare; \nI and my subjects feel, and you have had your share. \nTwice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive, \nScarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive: \nThe rolling flood runs warm with human gore; \nThe bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore. \nWhy put I not an end to this debate, \nStill unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate? \nIf Turnus' death a lasting peace can give, \nWhy should I not procure it whilst you live? \nShould I to doubtful arms your youth betray, \nWhat would my kinsmen the Rutulians say? \nAnd, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!) \nHow curse the cause which hasten'd to his end \nThe daughter's lover and the father's friend? \nWeigh in your mind the various chance of war; \nPity your parent's age, and ease his care.\" \nSuch balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain: \nThe proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain. \nThe wrathful youth, disdaining the relief, \nWith intermitting sobs thus vents his grief: \n\"The care, O best of fathers, which you take \nFor my concerns, at my desire forsake. \nPermit me not to languish out my days, \nBut make the best exchange of life for praise. \nThis arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize; \nAnd the blood follows, where the weapon flies. \nHis goddess mother is not near, to shroud \nThe flying coward with an empty cloud.\" \nBut now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life, \nAnd loath'd the hard conditions of the strife, \nHeld him by force; and, dying in his death, \nIn these sad accents gave her sorrow breath: \n\"O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears, \nAnd whate'er price Amata's honor bears \nWithin thy breast, since thou art all my hope, \nMy sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop; \nSince on the safety of thy life alone \nDepends Latinus, and the Latian throne: \nRefuse me not this one, this only pray'r, \nTo waive the combat, and pursue the war. \nWhatever chance attends this fatal strife, \nThink it includes, in thine, Amata's life. \nI cannot live a slave, or see my throne \nUsurp'd by strangers or a Trojan son.\" \nAt this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed; \nA crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread, \nVarying her cheeks by turns with white and red. \nThe driving colors, never at a stay, \nRun here and there, and flush, and fade away. \nDelightful change! Thus Indian iv'ry shows, \nWhich with the bord'ring paint of purple glows; \nOr lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose. \nThe lover gaz'd, and, burning with desire, \nThe more he look'd, the more he fed the fire: \nRevenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite, \nRoll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight. \nThen fixing on the queen his ardent eyes, \nFirm to his first intent, he thus replies: \n\"O mother, do not by your tears prepare \nSuch boding omens, and prejudge the war. \nResolv'd on fight, I am no longer free \nTo shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree.\" \nThen turning to the herald, thus pursues: \n\"Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news; \nDenounce from me, that, when to-morrow's light \nShall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the fight; \nThe Trojan and Rutulian troops no more \nShall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore: \nOur single swords the quarrel shall decide, \nAnd to the victor be the beauteous bride.\" \nHe said, and striding on, with speedy pace, \nHe sought his coursers of the Thracian race. \nAt his approach they toss their heads on high, \nAnd, proudly neighing, promise victory. \nThe sires of these Orythia sent from far, \nTo grace Pilumnus, when he went to war. \nThe drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white, \nNor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight. \nOfficious grooms stand ready by his side; \nAnd some with combs their flowing manes divide, \nAnd others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride\n\nHe sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass \nOf golden metal those, and mountain brass. \nThen to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied, \nAnd girt his faithful fauchion to his side. \nIn his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire \nThat fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire; \nImmortal keenness on the blade bestow'd, \nAnd plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood. \nPropp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore, \nWas plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore; \nWhich with such force he brandish'd in his hand, \nThe tough ash trembled like an osier wand: \nThen cried: \"O pond'rous spoil of Actor slain, \nAnd never yet by Turnus toss'd in vain, \nFail not this day thy wonted force; but go, \nSent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe! \nGive me to tear his corslet from his breast, \nAnd from that eunuch head to rend the crest; \nDragg'd in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil, \nHot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant oil!\"\n\nThus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies \nA fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes. \nSo fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight: \nProudly he bellows, and preludes the fight; \nHe tries his goring horns against a tree, \nAnd meditates his absent enemy; \nHe pushes at the winds; he digs the strand \nWith his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand. \nNor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms, \nTo future fight his manly courage warms: \nHe whets his fury, and with joy prepares \nTo terminate at once the ling'ring wars; \nTo cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates \nWhat Heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the fates. \nThen to the Latian king he sends, to cease \nThe rage of arms, and ratify the peace. \nThe morn ensuing, from the mountain's height, \nHad scarcely spread the skies with rosy light; \nTh' ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea, \nFrom out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day; \nWhen now the Trojan and Rutulian guard, \nIn friendly labor join'd, the list prepar'd. \nBeneath the walls they measure out the space; \nThen sacred altars rear, on sods of grass, \nWhere, with religious their common gods they place. \nIn purest white the priests their heads attire; \nAnd living waters bear, and holy fire; \nAnd, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair, \nLong twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear, \nIn order issuing from the town appears \nThe Latin legion, arm'd with pointed spears; \nAnd from the fields, advancing on a line, \nThe Trojan and the Tuscan forces join: \nTheir various arms afford a pleasing sight; \nA peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar'd for fight.\n\nBetwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride, \nGlitt'ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed; \nHere Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line, \nAnd there Messapus, born of seed divine. \nThe sign is giv'n; and, round the listed space, \nEach man in order fills his proper place. \nReclining on their ample shields, they stand, \nAnd fix their pointed lances in the sand. \nNow, studious of the sight, a num'rous throng \nOf either sex promiscuous, old and young, \nSwarm the town: by those who rest behind, \nThe gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd. \nMeantime the Queen of Heav'n beheld the sight, \nWith eyes unpleas'd, from Mount Albano's height \n(Since call'd Albano by succeeding fame, \nBut then an empty hill, without a name). \nShe thence survey'd the field, the Trojan pow'rs, \nThe Latian squadrons, and Laurentine tow'rs. \nThen thus the goddess of the skies bespoke, \nWith sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake, \nKing Turnus' sister, once a lovely maid, \nEre to the lust of lawless Jove betray'd: \nCompress'd by force, but, by the grateful god, \nNow made the Nais of the neighb'ring flood. \n\"O nymph, the pride of living lakes,\" said she, \n\"O most renown'd, and most belov'd by me, \nLong hast thou known, nor need I to record, \nThe wanton sallies of my wand'ring lord. \nOf ev'ry Latian fair whom Jove misled \nTo mount by stealth my violated bed, \nTo thee alone I grudg'd not his embrace, \nBut gave a part of heav'n, and an unenvied place. \nNow learn from me thy near approaching grief, \nNor think my wishes want to thy relief. \nWhile fortune favor'd, nor Heav'n's King denied \nTo lend my succor to the Latian side, \nI sav'd thy brother, and the sinking state: \nBut now he struggles with unequal fate, \nAnd goes, with gods averse, o'ermatch'd in might, \nTo meet inevitable death in fight; \nNor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight. \nThou, if thou dar'st thy present aid supply; \nIt well becomes a sister's care to try.\" \nAt this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress'd, \nThrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast. \nTo whom Saturnia thus: \"Thy tears are late: \nHaste, snatch him, if he can be snatch'd from fate: \nNew tumults kindle; violate the truce: \nWho knows what changeful fortune may produce? \n'T is not a crime t' attempt what I decree; \nOr, if it were, discharge the crime on me.\" \nShe said, and, sailing on the winged wind, \nLeft the sad nymph suspended in her mind. \nAnd now pomp the peaceful kings appear: \nFour steeds the chariot of Latinus bear; \nTwelve golden beams around his temples play, \nTo mark his lineage from the God of Day. \nTwo snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke, \nAnd in his hand two massy spears he shook: \nThen issued from the camp, in arms divine, \nAeneas, author of the Roman line; \nAnd by his side Ascanius took his place, \nThe second hope of Rome's immortal race. \nAdorn'd in white, a rev'rend priest appears, \nAnd off'rings to the flaming altars bears; \nA porket, and a lamb that never suffer'd shears. \nThen to the rising sun he turns his eyes, \nAnd strews the beasts, design'd for sacrifice, \nWith salt and meal: with like officious care \nHe marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair. \nBetwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds; \nWith the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds. \nAeneas then unsheath'd his shining sword, \nAnd thus with pious pray'rs the gods ador'd: \n\"All-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil, \nFor which I have sustain'd so long a toil, \nThou, King of Heav'n, and thou, the Queen of Air, \nPropitious now, and reconcil'd by pray'r; \nThou, God of War, whose unresisted sway \nThe labors and events of arms obey; \nYe living fountains, and ye running floods, \nAll pow'rs of ocean, all ethereal gods, \nHear, and bear record: if I fall in field, \nOr, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield, \nMy Trojans shall encrease Evander's town; \nAscanius shall renounce th' Ausonian crown: \nAll claims, all questions of debate, shall cease; \nNor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace. \nBut, if my juster arms prevail in fight, \n(As sure they shall, if I divine aright,) \nMy Trojans shall not o'er th' Italians reign: \nBoth equal, both unconquer'd shall remain, \nJoin'd in their laws, their lands, and their abodes; \nI ask but altars for my weary gods. \nThe care of those religious rites be mine; \nThe crown to King Latinus I resign: \nHis be the sov'reign sway. Nor will I share \nHis pow'r in peace, or his command in war. \nFor me, my friends another town shall frame, \nAnd bless the rising tow'rs with fair Lavinia's name.\" \nThus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands, \nThe Latian king before his altar stands. \n\"By the same heav'n,\" said he, \"and earth, and main, \nAnd all the pow'rs that all the three contain; \nBy hell below, and by that upper god \nWhose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod;\n\nSo let Latona's double offspring hear, \nAnd double-fronted Janus, what I swear: \nI touch the sacred altars, touch the flames, \nAnd all those pow'rs attest, and all their names; \nWhatever chance befall on either side, \nNo term of time this union shall divide: \nNo force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind, \nOr shake the steadfast tenor of my mind; \nNot tho' the circling seas should break their bound, \nO'erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground; \nNot tho' the lamps of heav'n their spheres forsake, \nHurl'd down, and hissing in the nether lake: \nEv'n as this royal scepter\" (for he bore \nA scepter in his hand) \"shall never more \nShoot out in branches, or renew the birth: \nAn orphan now, cut from the mother earth \nBy the keen ax, dishonor'd of its hair, \nAnd cas'd in brass, for Latian kings to bear.\" \nWhen thus in public view the peace was tied \nWith solemn vows, and sworn on either side, \nAll dues perform'd which holy rites require; \nThe victim beasts are slain before the fire, \nThe trembling entrails from their bodies torn, \nAnd to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne. \nAlready the Rutulians deem their man \nO'ermatch'd in arms, before the fight began. \nFirst rising fears are whisper'd thro' the crowd; \nThen, gath'ring sound, they murmur more aloud. \nNow, side to side, they measure with their eyes \nThe champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size: \nThe nearer they approach, the more is known \nTh' apparent disadvantage of their own. \nTurnus himself appears in public sight \nConscious of fate, desponding of the fight. \nSlowly he moves, and at his altar stands \nWith eyes dejected, and with trembling hands; \nAnd, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs, \nA livid deadness in his cheeks appears. \nWith anxious pleasure when Juturna view'd \nTh' increasing fright of the mad multitude, \nWhen their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard, \nAnd found their ready minds for change prepar'd; \nDissembling her immortal form, she took \nCamertus' mien, his habit, and his look; \nA chief of ancient blood; in arms well known \nWas his great sire, and he his greater son. \nHis shape assum'd, amid the ranks she ran, \nAnd humoring their first motions, thus began: \n\"For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight \nOf one expos'd for all, in single fight? \nCan we, before the face of heav'n, confess \nOur courage colder, or our numbers less? \nView all the Trojan host, th' Arcadian band, \nAnd Tuscan army; count 'em as they stand: \nUndaunted to the battle if we go, \nScarce ev'ry second man will share a foe. \nTurnus, 't is true, in this unequal strife, \nShall lose, with honor, his devoted life, \nOr change it rather for immortal fame, \nSucceeding to the gods, from whence he came: \nBut you, a servile and inglorious band, \nFor foreign lords shall sow your native land, \nThose fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd, \nWhich have so long their lazy sons sustain'd.\" \nWith words like these, she carried her design: \nA rising murmur runs along the line. \nThen ev'n the city troops, and Latians, tir'd \nWith tedious war, seem with new souls inspir'd: \nTheir champion's fate with pity they lament, \nAnd of the league, so lately sworn, repent. \nNor fails the goddess to foment the rage \nWith lying wonders, and a false presage; \nBut adds a sign, which, present to their eyes, \nInspires new courage, and a glad surprise. \nFor, sudden, in the fiery tracts above, \nAppears in pomp th' imperial bird of Jove: \nA plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes, \nAnd o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes; \nThen, stooping on the fairest of the train, \nIn his strong talons truss'd a silver swan. \nTh' Italians wonder at th' unusual sight; \nBut, while he lags, and labors in his flight, \nBehold, the dastard fowl return anew, \nAnd with united force the foe pursue: \nClam'rous around the royal hawk they fly, \nAnd, thick'ning in a cloud, o'ershade the sky. \nThey cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course; \nNor can th' incumber'd bird sustain their force; \nBut vex'd, not vanquish'd, drops the pond'rous prey, \nAnd, lighten'd of his burthen, wings his way. \nTh' Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight, \nEager of action, and demand the fight. \nThen King Tolumnius, vers'd in augurs' arts, \nCries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts: \n\"At length 't is granted, what I long desir'd! \nThis, this is what my frequent vows requir'd. \nYe gods, I take your omen, and obey. \nAdvance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way. \nThese are the foreign foes, whose impious band, \nLike that rapacious bird, infest our land: \nBut soon, like him, they shall be forc'd to sea \nBy strength united, and forego the prey. \nYour timely succor to your country bring, \nHaste to the rescue, and redeem your king.\" \nHe said; and, pressing onward thro' the crew, \nPois'd in his lifted arm, his lance he threw. \nThe winged weapon, whistling in the wind, \nCame driving on, nor miss'd the mark design'd. \nAt once the cornel rattled in the skies; \nAt once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise. \nNine brothers in a goodly band there stood, \nBorn of Arcadian mix'd with Tuscan blood, \nGylippus' sons: the fatal jav'lin flew, \nAim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew. \nA passage thro' the jointed arms it found, \nJust where the belt was to the body bound, \nAnd struck the gentle youth extended on the ground. \nThen, fir'd with pious rage, the gen'rous train \nRun madly forward to revenge the slain. \nAnd some with eager haste their jav'lins throw; \nAnd some with sword in hand assault the foe. \nThe wish'd insult the Latine troops embrace, \nAnd meet their ardor in the middle space. \nThe Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line, \nWith equal courage obviate their design. \nPeace leaves the violated fields, and hate \nBoth armies urges to their mutual fate. \nWith impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd, \nThe sacrifice half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd. \nThick storms of steel from either army fly, \nAnd clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky; \nBrands from the fire are missive weapons made, \nWith chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade. \nLatinus, frighted, hastens from the fray, \nAnd bears his unregarded gods away. \nThese on their horses vault; those yoke the car; \nThe rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war. \nMessapus, eager to confound the peace, \nSpurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting prease, \nAt King Aulestes, by his purple known \nA Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown; \nAnd, with a shock encount'ring, bore him down. \nBackward he fell; and, as his fate design'd, \nThe ruins of an altar were behind: \nThere, pitching on his shoulders and his head, \nAmid the scatt'ring fires he lay supinely spread. \nThe beamy spear, descending from above, \nHis cuirass pierc'd, and thro' his body drove. \nThen, with a scornful smile, the victor cries: \n\"The gods have found a fitter sacrifice.\" \nGreedy of spoils, th' Italians strip the dead \nOf his rich armor, and uncrown his head. \nPriest Corynaeus, arm'd his better hand, \nFrom his own altar, with a blazing brand; \nAnd, as Ebusus with a thund'ring pace \nAdvanc'd to battle, dash'd it on his face: \nHis bristly beard shines out with sudden fires; \nThe crackling crop a noisome scent expires. \nFollowing the blow, he seiz'd his curling crown \nWith his left hand; his other cast him down. \nThe prostrate body with his knees he press'd, \nAnd plung'd his holy poniard in his breast. \nWhile Podalirius, with his sword, pursued \nThe shepherd Alsus thro' the flying crowd, \nSwiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow \nFull on the front of his unwary foe. \nThe broad ax enters with a crashing sound, \nAnd cleaves the chin with one continued wound; \nWarm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around \nAn iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress'd, \nAnd seal'd their heavy lids in endless rest. \nBut good Aeneas rush'd amid the bands; \nBare was his head, and naked were his hands, \nIn sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud: \n\"What sudden rage, what new desire of blood, \nInflames your alter'd minds? O Trojans, cease \nFrom impious arms, nor violate the peace! \nBy human sanctions, and by laws divine, \nThe terms are all agreed; the war is mine. \nDismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue; \nThis hand alone shall right the gods and you: \nOur injur'd altars, and their broken vow, \nTo this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe.\" \nThus while he spoke, unmindful of defense, \nA winged arrow struck the pious prince. \nBut, whether from some human hand it came, \nOr hostile god, is left unknown by fame: \nNo human hand or hostile god was found, \nTo boast the triumph of so base a wound. \nWhen Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain, \nHis chiefs dismay'd, his troops a fainting train, \nTh' unhop'd event his heighten'd soul inspires: \nAt once his arms and coursers he requires; \nThen, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains, \nAnd with a ready hand assumes the reins. \nHe drives impetuous, and, where'er he goes, \nHe leaves behind a lane of slaughter'd foes. \nThese his lance reaches; over those he rolls \nHis rapid car, and crushes out their souls: \nIn vain the vanquish'd fly; the victor sends \nThe dead men's weapons at their living friends. \nThus, on the banks of Hebrus' freezing flood, \nThe God of Battles, in his angry mood, \nClashing his sword against his brazen shield, \nLet loose the reins, and scours along the field: \nBefore the wind his fiery coursers fly; \nGroans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky. \nWrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair \n(Dire faces, and deform'd) surround the car; \nFriends of the god, and followers of the war. \nWith fury not unlike, nor less disdain, \nExulting Turnus flies along the plain: \nHis smoking horses, at their utmost speed, \nHe lashes on, and urges o'er the dead. \nTheir fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound, \nThe gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around. \nThamyris and Pholus, masters of the war, \nHe kill'd at hand, but Sthenelus afar: \nFrom far the sons of Imbracus he slew, \nGlaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew; \nBoth taught to fight on foot, in battle join'd, \nOr mount the courser that outstrips the wind. \nMeantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field, \nNew fir'd the Trojans, and their foes repell'd. \nThis son of Dolon bore his grandsire's name, \nBut emulated more his father's fame; \nHis guileful father, sent a nightly spy, \nThe Grecian camp and order to descry: \nHard enterprise! and well he might require \nAchilles' car and horses, for his hire: \nBut, met upon the scout, th' Aetolian prince \nIn death bestow'd a juster recompense. \nFierce Turnus view'd the Trojan from afar, \nAnd launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car; \nThen lightly leaping down, pursued the blow, \nAnd, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe, \nWrench'd from his feeble hold the shining sword, \nAnd plung'd it in the bosom of its lord. \n\"Possess,\" said he, \"the fruit of all thy pains, \nAnd measure, at thy length, our Latian plains. \nThus are my foes rewarded by my hand; \nThus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!\"\n\nThen Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew, \nWhom o'er his neck his flound'ring courser threw. \nAs when loud Boreas, with his blust'ring train, \nStoops from above, incumbent on the main; \nWhere'er he flies, he drives the rack before, \nAnd rolls the billows on th' Aegaean shore: \nSo, where resistless Turnus takes his course, \nThe scatter'd squadrons bend before his force; \nHis crest of horses' hair is blown behind \nBy adverse air, and rustles in the wind. \nThis haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain, \nAnd, as the chariot roll'd along the plain, \nLight from the ground he leapt, and seiz'd the rein. \nThus hung in air, he still retain'd his hold, \nThe coursers frighted, and their course controll'd. \nThe lance of Turnus reach'd him as he hung, \nAnd pierc'd his plated arms, but pass'd along, \nAnd only raz'd the skin. He turn'd, and held \nAgainst his threat'ning foe his ample shield; \nThen call'd for aid: but, while he cried in vain, \nThe chariot bore him backward on the plain. \nHe lies revers'd; the victor king descends, \nAnd strikes so justly where his helmet ends, \nHe lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk \nWith streams that issue from the bleeding trunk. \nWhile he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield, \nThe wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field: \nStrong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried, \nAnd young Ascanius, weeping by his side, \nConduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear \nHis limbs from earth, supported on his spear. \nResolv'd in mind, regardless of the smart, \nHe tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart. \nThe steel remains. No readier way he found \nTo draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound. \nEager of fight, impatient of delay, \nHe begs; and his unwilling friends obey. \nIapis was at hand to prove his art, \nWhose blooming youth so fir'd Apollo's heart, \nThat, for his love, he proffer'd to bestow \nHis tuneful harp and his unerring bow. \nThe pious youth, more studious how to save \nHis aged sire, now sinking to the grave, \nPreferr'd the pow'r of plants, and silent praise \nOf healing arts, before Phoebean bays. \nPropp'd on his lance the pensive hero stood, \nAnd heard and saw, unmov'd, the mourning crowd. \nThe fam'd physician tucks his robes around \nWith ready hands, and hastens to the wound. \nWith gentle touches he performs his part, \nThis way and that, soliciting the dart, \nAnd exercises all his heav'nly art. \nAll soft'ning simples, known of sov'reign use, \nHe presses out, and pours their noble juice. \nThese first infus'd, to lenify the pain, \nHe tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain. \nThen to the patron of his art he pray'd: \nThe patron of his art refus'd his aid. \nMeantime the war approaches to the tents; \nTh' alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments: \nThe driving dust proclaims the danger near; \nAnd first their friends, and then their foes appear: \nTheir friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear. \nThe camp is fill'd with terror and affright: \nThe hissing shafts within the trench alight; \nAn undistinguish'd noise ascends the sky, \nThe shouts those who kill, and groans of those who die. \nBut now the goddess mother, mov'd with grief, \nAnd pierc'd with pity, hastens her relief. \nA branch of healing dittany she brought, \nWhich in the Cretan fields with care she sought: \nRough is the stern, which woolly leafs surround; \nThe leafs with flow'rs, the flow'rs with purple crown'd,\n\nWell known to wounded goats; a sure relief \nTo draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief. \nThis Venus brings, in clouds involv'd, and brews \nTh' extracted liquor with ambrosian dews, \nAnd odorous panacee. Unseen she stands, \nTemp'ring the mixture with her heav'nly hands, \nAnd pours it in a bowl, already crown'd \nWith juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the wound.\n\nThe leech, unknowing of superior art \nWhich aids the cure, with this foments the part; \nAnd in a moment ceas'd the raging smart. \nStanch'd is the blood, and in the bottom stands: \nThe steel, but scarcely touch'd with tender hands, \nMoves up, and follows of its own accord, \nAnd health and vigor are at once restor'd. \nIapis first perceiv'd the closing wound, \nAnd first the footsteps of a god he found. \n\"Arms! arms!\" he cries; \"the sword and shield prepare, \nAnd send the willing chief, renew'd, to war. \nThis is no mortal work, no cure of mine, \nNor art's effect, but done by hands divine. \nSome god our general to the battle sends; \nSome god preserves his life for greater ends.\" \nThe hero arms in haste; his hands infold \nHis thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold: \nInflam'd to fight, and rushing to the field, \nThat hand sustaining the celestial shield, \nThis gripes the lance, and with such vigor shakes, \nThat to the rest the beamy weapon quakes. \nThen with a close embrace he strain'd his son, \nAnd, kissing thro' his helmet, thus begun: \n\"My son, from my example learn the war, \nIn camps to suffer, and in fields to dare; \nBut happier chance than mine attend thy care! \nThis day my hand thy tender age shall shield, \nAnd crown with honors of the conquer'd field: \nThou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth \nTo toils of war, be mindful of my worth; \nAssert thy birthright, and in arms be known, \nFor Hector's nephew, and Aeneas' son.\" \nHe said; and, striding, issued on the plain. \nAnteus and Mnestheus, and a num'rous train, \nAttend his steps; the rest their weapons take, \nAnd, crowding to the field, the camp forsake. \nA cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around, \nLabors beneath their feet the trembling ground. \nNow Turnus, posted on a hill, from far \nBeheld the progress of the moving war: \nWith him the Latins view'd the cover'd plains, \nAnd the chill blood ran backward in their veins. \nJuturna saw th' advancing troops appear, \nAnd heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear. \nAeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train, \nClos'd in their ranks, and pouring on the plain. \nAs when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore \nFrom the mid ocean, drives the waves before; \nThe painful hind with heavy heart foresees \nThe flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees; \nWith like impetuous rage the prince appears \nBefore his doubled front, nor less destruction bears. \nAnd now both armies shock in open field; \nOsiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill'd. \nArchetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain \n(All fam'd in arms, and of the Latian train) \nBy Gyas', Mnestheus', and Achates' hand. \nThe fatal augur falls, by whose command \nThe truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued \nWith Trojan blood, th' unhappy fight renew'd. \nLoud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky, \nAnd o'er the field the frighted Latins fly. \nThe prince disdains the dastards to pursue, \nNor moves to meet in arms the fighting few; \nTurnus alone, amid the dusky plain, \nHe seeks, and to the combat calls in vain. \nJuturna heard, and, seiz'd with mortal fear, \nForc'd from the beam her brother's charioteer; \nAssumes his shape, his armor, and his mien, \nAnd, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen. \nAs the black swallow near the palace plies; \nO'er empty courts, and under arches, flies; \nNow hawks aloft, now skims along the flood, \nTo furnish her loquacious nest with food: \nSo drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains; \nThe smoking horses run with loosen'd reins. \nShe steers a various course among the foes; \nNow here, now there, her conqu'ring brother shows; \nNow with a straight, now with a wheeling flight, \nShe turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight. \nAeneas, fir'd with fury, breaks the crowd, \nAnd seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud: \nHe runs within a narrower ring, and tries \nTo stop the chariot; but the chariot flies. \nIf he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears, \nAnd far away the Daunian hero bears. \nWhat should he do! Nor arts nor arms avail; \nAnd various cares in vain his mind assail. \nThe great Messapus, thund'ring thro' the field, \nIn his left hand two pointed jav'lins held: \nEncount'ring on the prince, one dart he drew, \nAnd with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw. \nAeneas saw it come, and, stooping low \nBeneath his buckler, shunn'd the threat'ning blow. \nThe weapon hiss'd above his head, and tore \nThe waving plume which on his helm he wore. \nForced by this hostile act, and fir'd with spite, \nThat flying Turnus still declin'd the fight, \nThe Prince, whose piety had long repell'd \nHis inborn ardor, now invades the field; \nInvokes the pow'rs of violated peace, \nTheir rites and injur'd altars to redress; \nThen, to his rage abandoning the rein, \nWith blood and slaughter'd bodies fills the plain. \nWhat god can tell, what numbers can display, \nThe various labors of that fatal day; \nWhat chiefs and champions fell on either side, \nIn combat slain, or by what deaths they died; \nWhom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill'd; \nWho shar'd the fame and fortune of the field! \nJove, could'st thou view, and not avert thy sight, \nTwo jarring nations join'd in cruel fight, \nWhom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite! \nAeneas first Rutulian Sucro found, \nWhose valor made the Trojans quit their ground; \nBetwixt his ribs the jav'lin drove so just, \nIt reach'd his heart, nor needs a second thrust. \nNow Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; \nFirst from his horse fierce Amycus he threw: \nThen, leaping on the ground, on foot assail'd \nDiores, and in equal fight prevail'd. \nTheir lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; \nTheir heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. \nThree cold on earth the Trojan hero threw, \nWhom without respite at one charge he slew: \nCethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress'd, \nAnd sad Onythes, added to the rest, \nOf Theban blood, whom Peridia bore. \nTurnus two brothers from the Lycian shore, \nAnd from Apollo's fane to battle sent, \nO'erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent. \nPeaceful Menoetes after these he kill'd, \nWho long had shunn'd the dangers of the field: \nOn Lerna's lake a silent life he led, \nAnd with his nets and angle earn'd his bread; \nNor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew, \nBut wisely from th' infectious world withdrew: \nPoor was his house; his father's painful hand \nDischarg'd his rent, and plow'd another's land. \nAs flames among the lofty woods are thrown \nOn diff'rent sides, and both by winds are blown; \nThe laurels crackle in the sputt'ring fire; \nThe frighted sylvans from their shades retire: \nOr as two neighb'ring torrents fall from high; \nRapid they run; the foamy waters fry; \nThey roll to sea with unresisted force, \nAnd down the rocks precipitate their course: \nNot with less rage the rival heroes take \nTheir diff'rent ways, nor less destruction make. \nWith spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike; \nAnd zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike. \nLike them, their dauntless men maintain the field; \nAnd hearts are pierc'd, unknowing how to yield: \nThey blow for blow return, and wound for wound; \nAnd heaps of bodies raise the level ground. \nMurranus, boasting of his blood, that springs \nFrom a long royal race of Latian kings, \nIs by the Trojan from his chariot thrown, \nCrush'd with the weight of an unwieldy stone: \nBetwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore \nHis living load, his dying body tore. \nHis starting steeds, to shun the glitt'ring sword, \nPaw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord. \nFierce Hyllus threaten'd high, and, face to face, \nAffronted Turnus in the middle space: \nThe prince encounter'd him in full career, \nAnd at his temples aim'd the deadly spear; \nSo fatally the flying weapon sped, \nThat thro' his helm it pierc'd his head. \nNor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus' hand, \nIn vain the strongest of th' Arcadian band: \nNor to Cupentus could his gods afford \nAvailing aid against th' Aenean sword, \nWhich to his naked heart pursued the course; \nNor could his plated shield sustain the force. \nIolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow'rs, \nNor great subverter of the Trojan tow'rs, \nWere doom'd to kill, while Heav'n prolong'd his date; \nBut who can pass the bounds, prefix'd by fate? \nIn high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held \nTwo palaces, and was from each expell'd: \nOf all the mighty man, the last remains \nA little spot of foreign earth contains. \nAnd now both hosts their broken troops unite \nIn equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight. \nSeresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join \nThe Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line: \nSea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads \nThe Latin squadrons, and to battle leads. \nThey strike, they push, they throng the scanty space, \nResolv'd on death, impatient of disgrace; \nAnd, where one falls, another fills his place. \nThe Cyprian goddess now inspires her son \nTo leave th' unfinish'd fight, and storm the town: \nFor, while he rolls his eyes around the plain \nIn quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain, \nHe views th' unguarded city from afar, \nIn careless quiet, and secure of war. \nOccasion offers, and excites his mind \nTo dare beyond the task he first design'd. \nResolv'd, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight: \nAttended thus, he takes a neighb'ring height; \nThe crowding troops about their gen'ral stand, \nAll under arms, and wait his high command. \nThen thus the lofty prince: \"Hear and obey, \nYe Trojan bands, without the least delay \nJove is with us; and what I have decreed \nRequires our utmost vigor, and our speed. \nYour instant arms against the town prepare, \nThe source of mischief, and the seat of war. \nThis day the Latian tow'rs, that mate the sky, \nShall level with the plain in ashes lie: \nThe people shall be slaves, unless in time \nThey kneel for pardon, and repent their crime. \nTwice have our foes been vanquish'd on the plain: \nThen shall I wait till Turnus will be slain? \nYour force against the perjur'd city bend. \nThere it began, and there the war shall end. \nThe peace profan'd our rightful arms requires; \nCleanse the polluted place with purging fires.\" \nHe finish'd; and, one soul inspiring all, \nForm'd in a wedge, the foot approach the wall. \nWithout the town, an unprovided train \nOf gaping, gazing citizens are slain. \nSome firebrands, others scaling ladders bear, \nAnd those they toss aloft, and these they rear: \nThe flames now launch'd, the feather'd arrows fly, \nAnd clouds of missive arms obscure the sky. \nAdvancing to the front, the hero stands, \nAnd, stretching out to heav'n his pious hands, \nAttests the gods, asserts his innocence, \nUpbraids with breach of faith th' Ausonian prince; \nDeclares the royal honor doubly stain'd, \nAnd twice the rites of holy peace profan'd. \nDissenting clamors in the town arise; \nEach will be heard, and all at once advise. \nOne part for peace, and one for war contends; \nSome would exclude their foes, and some admit their friends.\n\nThe helpless king is hurried in the throng, \nAnd, whate'er tide prevails, is borne along. \nThus, when the swain, within a hollow rock, \nInvades the bees with suffocating smoke, \nThey run around, or labor on their wings, \nDisus'd to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings; \nTo shun the bitter fumes in vain they try; \nBlack vapors, issuing from the vent, involve the sky. \nBut fate and envious fortune now prepare \nTo plunge the Latins in the last despair. \nThe queen, who saw the foes invade the town, \nAnd brands on tops of burning houses thrown, \nCast round her eyes, distracted with her fear- \nNo troops of Turnus in the field appear. \nOnce more she stares abroad, but still in vain, \nAnd then concludes the royal youth is slain. \nMad with her anguish, impotent to bear \nThe mighty grief, she loathes the vital air. \nShe calls herself the cause of all this ill, \nAnd owns the dire effects of her ungovern'd will; \nShe raves against the gods; she beats her breast; \nShe tears with both her hands her purple vest: \nThen round a beam a running noose she tied, \nAnd, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died. \nSoon as the fatal news by Fame was blown, \nAnd to her dames and to her daughter known, \nThe sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair \nAnd rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share: \nWith shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair. \nThe spreading rumor fills the public place: \nConfusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace, \nAnd silent shame, are seen in ev'ry face. \nLatinus tears his garments as he goes, \nBoth for his public and his private woes; \nWith filth his venerable beard besmears, \nAnd sordid dust deforms his silver hairs. \nAnd much he blames the softness of his mind, \nObnoxious to the charms of womankind, \nAnd soon seduc'd to change what he so well design'd; \nTo break the solemn league so long desir'd, \nNor finish what his fates, and those of Troy, requir'd. \nNow Turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains, \nAnd here and there some straggling foes he gleans. \nHis flying coursers please him less and less, \nAsham'd of easy fight and cheap success. \nThus half-contented, anxious in his mind, \nThe distant cries come driving in the wind, \nShouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown'd; \nA jarring mixture, and a boding sound. \n\"Alas!\" said he, \"what mean these dismal cries? \nWhat doleful clamors from the town arise?\" \nConfus'd, he stops, and backward pulls the reins. \nShe who the driver's office now sustains, \nReplies: \"Neglect, my lord, these new alarms; \nHere fight, and urge the fortune of your arms: \nThere want not others to defend the wall. \nIf by your rival's hand th' Italians fall, \nSo shall your fatal sword his friends oppress, \nIn honor equal, equal in success.\" \nTo this, the prince: \"O sister- for I knew \nThe peace infring'd proceeded first from you; \nI knew you, when you mingled first in fight; \nAnd now in vain you would deceive my sight- \nWhy, goddess, this unprofitable care? \nWho sent you down from heav'n, involv'd in air, \nYour share of mortal sorrows to sustain, \nAnd see your brother bleeding on the plain? \nFor to what pow'r can Turnus have recourse, \nOr how resist his fate's prevailing force? \nThese eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground: \nMighty the man, and mighty was the wound. \nI heard my dearest friend, with dying breath, \nMy name invoking to revenge his death. \nBrave Ufens fell with honor on the place, \nTo shun the shameful sight of my disgrace. \nOn earth supine, a manly corpse he lies; \nHis vest and armor are the victor's prize. \nThen, shall I see Laurentum in a flame, \nWhich only wanted, to complete my shame? \nHow will the Latins hoot their champion's flight! \nHow Drances will insult and point them to the sight! \nIs death so hard to bear? Ye gods below, \n(Since those above so small compassion show,) \nReceive a soul unsullied yet with shame, \nWhich not belies my great forefather's name!\" \nHe said; and while he spoke, with flying speed \nCame Sages urging on his foamy steed: \nFix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore, \nAnd, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before: \n\"Turnus, on you, on you alone, depends \nOur last relief: compassionate your friends! \nLike lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on, \nWith arms invests, with flames invades the town: \nThe brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire \nTo drive along the deluge of the fire. \nAll eyes are fix'd on you: your foes rejoice; \nEv'n the king staggers, and suspends his choice; \nDoubts to deliver or defend the town, \nWhom to reject, or whom to call his son. \nThe queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd, \nHerself suborning death, has breath'd her last. \n'T is true, Messapus, fearless of his fate, \nWith fierce Atinas' aid, defends the gate: \nOn ev'ry side surrounded by the foe, \nThe more they kill, the greater numbers grow; \nAn iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow. \nYou, far aloof from your forsaken bands, \nYour rolling chariot drive o'er empty \nStupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin'd, \nAnd various cares revolving in his mind: \nRage, boiling from the bottom of his breast, \nAnd sorrow mix'd with shame, his soul oppress'd; \nAnd conscious worth lay lab'ring in his thought, \nAnd love by jealousy to madness wrought. \nBy slow degrees his reason drove away \nThe mists of passion, and resum'd her sway. \nThen, rising on his car, he turn'd his look, \nAnd saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke. \nA wooden tow'r with flames already blaz'd, \nWhich his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd; \nAnd bridges laid above to join the space, \nAnd wheels below to roll from place to place. \n\"Sister, the Fates have vanquish'd: let us go \nThe way which Heav'n and my hard fortune show. \nThe fight is fix'd; nor shall the branded name \nOf a base coward blot your brother's fame. \nDeath is my choice; but suffer me to try \nMy force, and vent my rage before I die.\" \nHe said; and, leaping down without delay, \nThro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way. \nStriding he pass'd, impetuous as the wind, \nAnd left the grieving goddess far behind. \nAs when a fragment, from a mountain torn \nBy raging tempests, or by torrents borne, \nOr sapp'd by time, or loosen'd from the roots- \nProne thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots, \nRolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep; \nDown sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep: \nInvolv'd alike, they rush to nether ground; \nStunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from earth rebound:\n\nSo Turnus, hasting headlong to the town, \nShould'ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down. \nStill pressing onward, to the walls he drew, \nWhere shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew, \nAnd sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue. \nFirst stretching out his arm, in sign of peace, \nHe cries aloud, to make the combat cease: \n\"Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire! \nThe fight is mine; and me the gods require. \n'T is just that I should vindicate alone \nThe broken truce, or for the breach atone. \nThis day shall free from wars th' Ausonian state, \nOr finish my misfortunes in my fate.\" \nBoth armies from their bloody work desist, \nAnd, bearing backward, form a spacious list. \nThe Trojan hero, who receiv'd from fame \nThe welcome sound, and heard the champion's name, \nSoon leaves the taken works and mounted walls, \nGreedy of war where greater glory calls. \nHe springs to fight, exulting in his force \nHis jointed armor rattles in the course. \nLike Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows, \nOr Father Apennine, when, white with snows, \nHis head divine obscure in clouds he hides, \nAnd shakes the sounding forest on his sides. \nThe nations, overaw'd, surcease the fight; \nImmovable their bodies, fix'd their sight. \nEv'n death stands still; nor from above they throw \nTheir darts, nor drive their batt'ring-rams below. \nIn silent order either army stands, \nAnd drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands. \nTh' Ausonian king beholds, with wond'ring sight, \nTwo mighty champions match'd in single fight, \nBorn under climes remote, and brought by fate, \nWith swords to try their titles to the state. \nNow, in clos'd field, each other from afar \nThey view; and, rushing on, begin the war. \nThey launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet; \nThe trembling soil resounds beneath their feet: \nTheir bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high, \nAnd flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly. \nCourage conspires with chance, and both ingage \nWith equal fortune yet, and mutual rage. \nAs when two bulls for their fair female fight \nIn Sila's shades, or on Taburnus' height; \nWith horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies; \nMute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes, \nAnd wait th' event; which victor they shall bear, \nAnd who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year: \nWith rage of love the jealous rivals burn, \nAnd push for push, and wound for wound return; \nTheir dewlaps gor'd, their sides are lav'd in blood; \nLoud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro' the wood: \nSuch was the combat in the listed ground; \nSo clash their swords, and so their shields resound. \nJove sets the beam; in either scale he lays \nThe champions' fate, and each exactly weighs. \nOn this side, life and lucky chance ascends; \nLoaded with death, that other scale descends. \nRais'd on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow \nFull on the helm of his unguarded foe: \nShrill shouts and clamors ring on either side, \nAs hopes and fears their panting hearts divide. \nBut all in pieces flies the traitor sword, \nAnd, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord. \nNow is but death, or flight; disarm'd he flies, \nWhen in his hand an unknown hilt he spies. \nFame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join'd, \nHurrying to war, disorder'd in his mind, \nSnatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find. \n'T was not the fated sword his father bore, \nBut that his charioteer Metiscus wore. \nThis, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held; \nBut, vain against the great Vulcanian shield, \nThe mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand: \nThe shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand. \nSurpris'd with fear, he fled along the field, \nAnd now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd; \nFor here the Trojan troops the list surround, \nAnd there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.\n\nAeneas hastens, tho' with heavier pace- \nHis wound, so newly knit, retards the chase, \nAnd oft his trembling knees their aid refuse- \nYet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues. \nThus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around \nWith crimson toils, or in a river found, \nHigh on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears, \nStill opening, following still, where'er he steers; \nThe persecuted creature, to and fro, \nTurns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe: \nSteep is th' ascent, and, if he gains the land, \nThe purple death is pitch'd along the strand. \nHis eager foe, determin'd to the chase, \nStretch'd at his length, gains ground at ev'ry pace; \nNow to his beamy head he makes his way, \nAnd now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey: \nJust at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear; \nHe bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:\n\nThe rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries; \nThe mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies. \nThus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames \nHis tardy troops, and, calling by their names, \nDemands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats \nThe realm with ruin, and their ancient seats \nTo lay in ashes, if they dare supply \nWith arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy: \nThus menacing, he still pursues the course, \nWith vigor, tho' diminish'd of his force. \nTen times already round the listed place \nOne chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase: \nNo trivial prize is play'd; for on the life \nOr death of Turnus now depends the strife. \nWithin the space, an olive tree had stood, \nA sacred shade, a venerable wood, \nFor vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god. \nHere hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd, \nOf sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd. \nWith heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the tree, \nTo make the ground inclos'd for combat free. \nDeep in the root, whether by fate, or chance, \nOr erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance; \nThen stoop'd, and tugg'd with force immense, to free \nTh' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree; \nThat, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain, \nHis flying weapon might from far attain. \nConfus'd with fear, bereft of human aid, \nThen Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray'd: \n\"O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth, \nWhere I thy foster son receiv'd my birth, \nHold fast the steel! If my religious hand \nYour plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd, \nPropitious hear my pious pray'r!\" He said, \nNor with successless vows invok'd their aid. \nTh' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd; \nBut still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd. \nJuturna took her time; and, while in vain \nHe strove, assum'd Meticus' form again, \nAnd, in that imitated shape, restor'd \nTo the despairing prince his Daunian sword. \nThe Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief, \nSaw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief, \nT' assert her offspring with a greater deed, \nFrom the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed. \nOnce more erect, the rival chiefs advance: \nOne trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance; \nAnd both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance. \nMeantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke, \nWho from a shining cloud beheld the shock: \n\"What new arrest, O Queen of Heav'n, is sent \nTo stop the Fates now lab'ring in th' event? \nWhat farther hopes are left thee to pursue? \nDivine Aeneas, (and thou know'st it too,) \nForedoom'd, to these celestial seats are due. \nWhat more attempts for Turnus can be made, \nThat thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade? \nIs it becoming of the due respect \nAnd awful honor of a god elect, \nA wound unworthy of our state to feel, \nPatient of human hands and earthly steel? \nOr seems it just, the sister should restore \nA second sword, when one was lost before, \nAnd arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror? \nFor what, without thy knowledge and avow, \nNay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do? \nAt last, in deference to my love, forbear \nTo lodge within thy soul this anxious care; \nReclin'd upon my breast, thy grief unload: \nWho should relieve the goddess, but the god? \nNow all things to their utmost issue tend, \nPush'd by the Fates to their appointed \nWhile leave was giv'n thee, and a lawful hour \nFor vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r, \nToss'd on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress, \nAnd, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms oppress; \nDeform the royal house; and, from the side \nOf the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride: \nNow cease at my command.\" The Thund'rer said; \nAnd, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made: \n\"Because your dread decree too well I knew, \nFrom Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew. \nElse should you not behold me here, alone, \nInvolv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan, \nBut, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight \nEngag'd against my foes in mortal fight. \n'T is true, Juturna mingled in the strife \nBy my command, to save her brother's life- \nAt least to try; but, by the Stygian lake, \n(The most religious oath the gods can take,) \nWith this restriction, not to bend the bow, \nOr toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw. \nAnd now, resign'd to your superior might, \nAnd tir'd with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight. \nThis let me beg (and this no fates withstand) \nBoth for myself and for your father's land, \nThat, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace, \n(Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,) \nThe laws of either nation be the same; \nBut let the Latins still retain their name, \nSpeak the same language which they spoke before, \nWear the same habits which their grandsires wore. \nCall them not Trojans: perish the renown \nAnd name of Troy, with that detested town. \nLatium be Latium still; let Alba reign \nAnd Rome's immortal majesty remain.\" \nThen thus the founder of mankind replies \n(Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes) \n\"Can Saturn's issue, and heav'n's other heir, \nSuch endless anger in her bosom bear? \nBe mistress, and your full desires obtain; \nBut quench the choler you foment in vain. \nFrom ancient blood th' Ausonian people sprung, \nShall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue. \nThe Trojans to their customs shall be tied: \nI will, myself, their common rites provide; \nThe natives shall command, the foreigners subside. \nAll shall be Latium; Troy without a name; \nAnd her lost sons forget from whence they came. \nFrom blood so mix'd, a pious race shall flow, \nEqual to gods, excelling all below. \nNo nation more respect to you shall pay, \nOr greater off'rings on your altars lay.\" \nJuno consents, well pleas'd that her desires \nHad found success, and from the cloud retires. \nThe peace thus made, the Thund'rer next prepares \nTo force the wat'ry goddess from the wars. \nDeep in the dismal regions void of light, \nThree daughters at a birth were born to Night: \nThese their brown mother, brooding on her care, \nIndued with windy wings to flit in air, \nWith serpents girt alike, and crown'd with hissing hair.\n\nIn heav'n the Dirae call'd, and still at hand, \nBefore the throne of angry Jove they stand, \nHis ministers of wrath, and ready still \nThe minds of mortal men with fears to fill, \nWhene'er the moody sire, to wreak his hate \nOn realms or towns deserving of their fate, \nHurls down diseases, death and deadly care, \nAnd terrifies the guilty world with war. \nOne sister plague if these from heav'n he sent, \nTo fright Juturna with a dire portent. \nThe pest comes whirling down: by far more slow \nSprings the swift arrow from the Parthian bow, \nOr Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies, \nAnd drench'd in pois'nous juice, the sure destruction flies.\n\nWith such a sudden and unseen a flight \nShot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night. \nSoon as the field inclos'd she had in view, \nAnd from afar her destin'd quarry knew, \nContracted, to the boding bird she turns, \nWhich haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns, \nAnd beats about the tombs with nightly wings, \nWhere songs obscene on sepulchers she sings. \nThus lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries \nThe Fury round unhappy Turnus flies, \nFlaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes. \nA lazy chillness crept along his blood; \nChok'd was his voice; his hair with horror stood. \nJuturna from afar beheld her fly, \nAnd knew th' ill omen, by her screaming cry \nAnd stridor of her wings. Amaz'd with fear, \nHer beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair.\n\n\"Ah me!\" she cries, \"in this unequal strife \nWhat can thy sister more to save thy life? \nWeak as I am, can I, alas! contend \nIn arms with that inexorable fiend? \nNow, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright \nMy tender soul, ye baleful birds of night; \nThe lashing of your wings I know too well, \nThe sounding flight, and fun'ral screams of hell! \nThese are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove, \nThe worthy recompense of ravish'd love! \nDid he for this exempt my life from fate? \nO hard conditions of immortal state, \nTho' born to death, not privileg'd to die, \nBut forc'd to bear impos'd eternity! \nTake back your envious bribes, and let me go \nCompanion to my brother's ghost below! \nThe joys are vanish'd: nothing now remains, \nOf life immortal, but immortal pains. \nWhat earth will open her devouring womb, \nTo rest a weary goddess in the tomb!\" \nShe drew a length of sighs; nor more she said, \nBut in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head, \nThen plung'd into her stream, with deep despair, \nAnd her last sobs came bubbling up in air. \nNow stern Aeneas his weighty spear \nAgainst his foe, and thus upbraids his fear: \n\"What farther subterfuge can Turnus find? \nWhat empty hopes are harbor'd in his mind? \n'T is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight; \nNot with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight. \nVary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare \nWhat skill and courage can attempt in war; \nWish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky; \nOr hid, within the hollow earth to lie!\" \nThe champion shook his head, and made this short reply: \n\"No threats of thine my manly mind can move; \n'T is hostile heav'n I dread, and partial Jove.\" \nHe said no more, but, with a sigh, repress'd \nThe mighty sorrow in his swelling breast. \nThen, as he roll'd his troubled eyes around, \nAn antique stone he saw, the common bound \nOf neighb'ring fields, and barrier of the ground; \nSo vast, that twelve strong men of modern days \nTh' enormous weight from earth could hardly raise. \nHe heav'd it at a lift, and, pois'd on high, \nRan stagg'ring on against his enemy, \nBut so disorder'd, that he scarcely knew \nHis way, or what unwieldly weight he threw. \nHis knocking knees are bent beneath the load, \nAnd shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood. \nThe stone drops from his arms, and, falling short \nFor want of vigor, mocks his vain effort. \nAnd as, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight, \nThe sickly fancy labors in the night; \nWe seem to run; and, destitute of force, \nOur sinking limbs forsake us in the course: \nIn vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry; \nThe nerves, unbrac'd, their usual strength deny; \nAnd on the tongue the falt'ring accents die: \nSo Turnus far'd; whatever means he tried, \nAll force of arms and points of art employ'd, \nThe Fury flew athwart, and made th' endeavor void. \nA thousand various thoughts his soul confound; \nHe star'd about, nor aid nor issue found; \nHis own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround. \nOnce more he pauses, and looks out again, \nAnd seeks the goddess charioteer in vain. \nTrembling he views the thund'ring chief advance, \nAnd brandishing aloft the deadly lance: \nAmaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe, \nForgets to ward, and waits the coming blow. \nAstonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with fear, \nAim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear. \nThe hero measur'd first, with narrow view, \nThe destin'd mark; and, rising as he threw, \nWith its full swing the fatal weapon flew. \nNot with less rage the rattling thunder falls, \nOr stones from batt'ring-engines break the walls: \nSwift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong, \nThe lance drove on, and bore the death along. \nNaught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail, \nNor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail: \nIt pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound \nTransfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground. \nWith groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky: \nWoods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply. \nNow low on earth the lofty chief is laid, \nWith eyes cast upward, and with arms display'd, \nAnd, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd: \n\"I know my death deserv'd, nor hope to live: \nUse what the gods and thy good fortune give. \nYet think, O think, if mercy may be shown- \nThou hadst a father once, and hast a son- \nPity my sire, now sinking to the grave; \nAnd for Anchises' sake old Daunus save! \nOr, if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death, \nGive to my friends my body void of breath! \nThe Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life; \nThine is the conquest, thine the royal wife: \nAgainst a yielded man, 't is mean ignoble strife.\" \nIn deep suspense the Trojan seem'd to stand, \nAnd, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand. \nHe roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt \nHis manly soul with more compassion melt; \nWhen, casting down a casual glance, he spied \nThe golden belt that glitter'd on his side, \nThe fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore \nFrom dying Pallas, and in triumph wore. \nThen, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries \n(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes) \n\"Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend, \nClad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend? \nTo his sad soul a grateful off'ring go! \n'T is Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow.\" \nHe rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word, \nDeep in his bosom drove the shining sword. \nThe streaming blood distain'd his arms around, \nAnd the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound. \n\nTHE END\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}
