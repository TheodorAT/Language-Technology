       "'BOOK I\\n\\nSing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought\\ncountless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying\\ndown to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures,\\nfor so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the\\nson of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with\\none another. \\n\\nAnd which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the\\nson of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence\\nupon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had\\ndishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships\\nof the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a great\\nransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed\\nwith a suppliant\\'s wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but most of\\nall the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs. \\n\\n\"Sons of Atreus,\" he cried, \"and all other Achaeans, may the gods\\nwho dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach\\nyour homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for\\nher, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.\" \\n\\nOn this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting\\nthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,\\nwho spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. \"Old man,\" said\\nhe, \"let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming\\nhereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you\\nnothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos\\nfar from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting\\nmy couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for\\nyou.\" \\n\\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by\\nthe shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom\\nlovely Leto had borne. \"Hear me,\" he cried, \"O god of the silver bow,\\nthat protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy\\nmight, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple\\nwith garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats,\\ngrant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the\\nDanaans.\" \\n\\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious\\nfrom the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his\\nshoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled\\nwithin him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as\\ndark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow\\nin the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their hounds,\\nbut presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and all\\nday long the pyres of the dead were burning. \\n\\nFor nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon\\nthe tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,\\nwho saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon\\nthem. Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus,\" said he, \"I deem that we should now turn roving home\\nif we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and\\npestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader\\nof dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus\\nApollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we have\\nbroken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will\\naccept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take\\naway the plague from us.\" \\n\\nWith these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest of\\naugurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He\\nit was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through\\nthe prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With\\nall sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:- \\n\\n\"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of\\nKing Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear\\nthat you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that\\nI shall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the\\nAchaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger\\nof a king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge\\ntill he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will\\nprotect me.\" \\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon\\nyou from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose\\noracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his\\nhand upon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth-\\nno, not though you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost\\nof the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nThereon the seer spoke boldly. \"The god,\" he said, \"is angry neither\\nabout vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest\\'s sake, whom Agamemnon\\nhas dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a\\nransom for her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and will\\nyet send others. He will not deliver the Danaans from this pestilence\\ntill Agamemnon has restored the girl without fee or ransom to her\\nfather, and has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse. Thus we may perhaps\\nappease him.\" \\n\\nWith these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heart\\nwas black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchas\\nand said, \"Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things concerning\\nme, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You have\\nbrought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come seeing\\namong Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would\\nnot take a ransom for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set\\nmy heart on keeping her in my own house, for I love her better even\\nthan my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she is alike in form and\\nfeature, in understanding and accomplishments. Still I will give her\\nup if I must, for I would have the people live, not die; but you must\\nfind me a prize instead, or I alone among the Argives shall be without\\none. This is not well; for you behold, all of you, that my prize is\\nto go elsewhither.\" \\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond\\nall mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have\\nno common store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities\\nhave been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made\\nalready. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove grants\\nus to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold.\"\\n\\nThen Agamemnon said, \"Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not\\nthus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade\\nme. Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss\\nand give up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize\\nin fair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or\\nthat of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall\\nrue my coming. But of this we will take thought hereafter; for the\\npresent, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her\\nexpressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseis\\nalso; further, let some chief man among us be in command, either Ajax,\\nor Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you\\nare, that we may offer sacrifice and appease the the anger of the\\ngod.\" \\n\\nAchilles scowled at him and answered, \"You are steeped in insolence\\nand lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your\\nbidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here\\nfor any ill the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel with them.\\nThey have not raided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests\\non the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and them there is a great\\nspace, both mountain and sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence!\\nfor your pleasure, not ours- to gain satisfaction from the Trojans\\nfor your shameless self and for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten\\nto rob me of the prize for which I have toiled, and which the sons\\nof the Achaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans sack any rich\\ncity of the Trojans do I receive so good a prize as you do, though\\nit is my hands that do the better part of the fighting. When the sharing\\ncomes, your share is far the largest, and I, forsooth, must go back\\nto my ships, take what I can get and be thankful, when my labour of\\nfighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will\\nbe much better for me to return home with my ships, for I will not\\nstay here dishonoured to gather gold and substance for you.\"\\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Fly if you will, I shall make you no prayers\\nto stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and above all\\nJove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me\\nas you are, for you are ever quarrelsome and ill affected. What though\\nyou be brave? Was it not heaven that made you so? Go home, then, with\\nyour ships and comrades to lord it over the Myrmidons. I care neither\\nfor you nor for your anger; and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo\\nis taking Chryseis from me, I shall send her with my ship and my followers,\\nbut I shall come to your tent and take your own prize Briseis, that\\nyou may learn how much stronger I am than you are, and that another\\nmay fear to set himself up as equal or comparable with me.\"\\n\\nThe son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy breast\\nwas divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside, and\\nkill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger.\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from\\nits scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had sent her\\nin the love she bore to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by\\nhis yellow hair, visible to him alone, for of the others no man could\\nsee her. Achilles turned in amaze, and by the fire that flashed from\\nher eyes at once knew that she was Minerva. \"Why are you here,\" said\\nhe, \"daughter of aegis-bearing Jove? To see the pride of Agamemnon,\\nson of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shall surely be- he shall pay\\nfor this insolence with his life.\" \\n\\nAnd Minerva said, \"I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bid\\nyou stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you alike.\\nCease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him\\nif you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you- and\\nit shall surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times\\nas splendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore, and\\nobey.\" \\n\\n\"Goddess,\" answered Achilles, \"however angry a man may be, he must\\ndo as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear\\nthe prayers of him who has obeyed them.\" \\n\\nHe stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it\\nback into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to\\nOlympus among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.\\n\\nBut the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus, for\\nhe was still in a rage. \"Wine-bibber,\" he cried, \"with the face of\\na dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host\\nin fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this\\nas you do death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes\\nfrom any man who contradicts you. You devour your people, for you\\nare king over a feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward\\nyou would insult no man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a great\\noath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf nor\\nshoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left its parent stem\\nupon the mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and bark, and\\nnow the sons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians of the\\ndecrees of heaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter\\nthey shall look fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the\\nday of your distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand\\nof Hector, you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your\\nheart with rage for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest\\nof the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nWith this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on the\\nground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning fiercely\\nfrom his place upon the other side. Then uprose smooth-tongued Nestor,\\nthe facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his lips\\nsweeter than honey. Two generations of men born and bred in Pylos\\nhad passed away under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third.\\nWith all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-\\n\\n\"Of a truth,\" he said, \"a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean land.\\nSurely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be glad\\nat heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are\\nso excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you;\\ntherefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend\\nof men even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.\\nNever again can I behold such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd\\nof his people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus\\nson of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest men\\never born upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought\\nthe fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them.\\nI came from distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they would\\nhave me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now living\\ncould withstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded\\nby them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent\\nway. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl\\naway, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles;\\nand you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who\\nby the grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon.\\nYou are strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon\\nis stronger than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus,\\ncheck your anger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who\\nin the day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, all that you have said is true, but\\nthis fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord\\nof all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be.\\nGranted that the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also\\ngiven him the right to speak with railing?\" \\n\\nAchilles interrupted him. \"I should be a mean coward,\" he cried, \"were\\nI to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not me,\\nfor I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to\\nyour heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl,\\nfor those that take were those also that gave. But of all else that\\nis at my ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others\\nmay see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood.\"\\n\\nWhen they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up the\\nassembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back\\nto his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company,\\nwhile Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty\\noarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb\\nfor the god. And Ulysses went as captain. \\n\\nThese, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. But\\nthe son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purified\\nthemselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they offered hecatombs\\nof bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore, and the smoke\\nwith the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards heaven.\\n\\nThus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon did\\nnot forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty\\nmessengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. \"Go,\" said he, \"to\\nthe tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and\\nbring her hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others\\nand take her- which will press him harder.\" \\n\\nHe charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon they\\nwent their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to the tents\\nand ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent\\nand his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood\\nfearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak,\\nbut he knew them and said, \"Welcome, heralds, messengers of gods and\\nmen; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but with Agamemnon who\\nhas sent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her\\nand give her to them, but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods,\\nby mortal men, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon\\'s anger, that if\\never again there be need of me to save the people from ruin, they\\nshall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is mad with rage and\\nknows not how to look before and after that the Achaeans may fight\\nby their ships in safety.\" \\n\\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis\\nfrom the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with\\nthem to the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. Then\\nAchilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and looking\\nout upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in prayer\\nto his immortal mother, \"Mother,\" he cried, \"you bore me doomed to\\nlive but for a little season; surely Jove, who thunders from Olympus,\\nmight have made that little glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon, son\\nof Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me of my prize by\\nforce.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was\\nsitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father. Forthwith\\nshe rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down before\\nhim as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said, \"My\\nson, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it not\\nfrom me, but tell me, that we may know it together.\" \\n\\nAchilles drew a deep sigh and said, \"You know it; why tell you what\\nyou know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of Eetion,\\nsacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans\\nshared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as the\\nmeed of Agamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the ships\\nof the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a great\\nransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo, wreathed\\nwith a suppliant\\'s wreath, and he besought the Achaeans, but most\\nof all the two sons of Atreus who were their chiefs. \\n\\n\"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting\\nthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,\\nwho spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So he went back\\nin anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then\\nthe god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick\\non one another, for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host\\nof the Achaeans. At last a seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared\\nto us the oracles of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we\\nshould appease him. Whereon the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened\\nthat which he has since done. The Achaeans are now taking the girl\\nin a ship to Chryse, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but\\nthe heralds have just taken from my tent the daughter of Briseus,\\nwhom the Achaeans had awarded to myself. \\n\\n\"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and\\nif you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid\\nof Jove. Ofttimes in my father\\'s house have I heard you glory in that\\nyou alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when\\nthe others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put\\nhim in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to\\nOlympus the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men\\nAegaeon, for he is stronger even than his father; when therefore he\\ntook his seat all-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other gods\\nwere afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of\\nall this, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans.\\nLet the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish\\non the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their king,\\nand that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to the\\nforemost of the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nThetis wept and answered, \"My son, woe is me that I should have borne\\nor suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free from\\nall sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you\\nshould be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers:\\nwoe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I will\\ngo to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove, if\\nhe will hear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your ships,\\nnurse your anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from fight.\\nFor Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast among the Ethiopians,\\nand the other gods went with him. He will return to Olympus twelve\\ndays hence; I will then go to his mansion paved with bronze and will\\nbeseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade him.\"\\n\\nOn this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had been\\ntaken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.\\nWhen they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid\\nthem in the ship\\'s hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the\\nmast into its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would\\nhave her lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast\\nthe hawsers. They then got out upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatomb\\nfor Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the\\naltar to deliver her into the hands of her father. \"Chryses,\" said\\nhe, \"King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child, and\\nto offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may\\npropitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow upon the Argives.\"\\n\\nSo saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her gladly,\\nand they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of the\\ngod. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle\\nover the victims, while Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud\\non their behalf. \"Hear me,\" he cried, \"O god of the silver bow, that\\nprotectest Chryse and holy Cilla, and rulest Tenedos with thy might.\\nEven as thou didst hear me aforetime when I prayed, and didst press\\nhardly upon the Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful\\npestilence from the Danaans.\" \\n\\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done\\npraying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of\\nthe victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the thigh-bones,\\nwrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat\\non the top of them, and then Chryses laid them on the wood fire and\\npoured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged\\nspits in their hands. When the thigh-bones were burned and they had\\ntasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces\\nupon the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off:\\nthen, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they\\nate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied.\\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, pages filled the\\nmixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving\\nevery man his drink-offering. \\n\\nThus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning\\nhim and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their\\nvoices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid\\nthemselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when\\nthe child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they again set\\nsail for the host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair wind, so\\nthey raised their mast and hoisted their white sails aloft. As the\\nsail bellied with the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water,\\nand the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. When they\\nreached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the vessel\\nashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath\\nher, and went their ways to their own tents and ships. \\n\\nBut Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not\\nto the honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed\\nat his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry. \\n\\nNow after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to Olympus,\\nand Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her son\\nhad laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through\\ngreat heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty\\nson of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. She sat herself\\ndown before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while with\\nher right she caught him under the chin, and besought him, saying-\\n\\n\"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the\\nimmortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is\\nto be cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking\\nhis prize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord\\nof counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give\\nmy son his due and load him with riches in requital.\" \\n\\nJove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still\\nkept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. \"Incline\\nyour head,\" said she, \"and promise me surely, or else deny me- for\\nyou have nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly you disdain\\nme.\" \\n\\nAt this Jove was much troubled and answered, \"I shall have trouble\\nif you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with\\nher taunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before\\nthe other gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back\\nnow, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will\\nbring it about as wish. See, I incline my head that you believe me.\\nThis is the most solemn that I can give to any god. I never recall\\nmy word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded\\nmy head.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosial\\nlocks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus reeled.\\n\\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to his\\nhouse, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged\\ninto the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before\\nthe coming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting,\\nbut all stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat.\\nBut Juno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman\\'s daughter,\\nsilver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began\\nto upbraid him. \"Trickster,\" she cried, \"which of the gods have you\\nbeen taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters\\nin secret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could\\nhelp it, one word of your intentions.\" \\n\\n\"Juno,\" replied the sire of gods and men, \"you must not expect to\\nbe informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find\\nit hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there\\nis no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to\\nkeep a matter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions.\"\\n\\n\"Dread son of Saturn,\" answered Juno, \"what are you talking about?\\nI? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in everything.\\nStill, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman\\'s daughter Thetis\\nhas been talking you over, for she was with you and had hold of your\\nknees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that you have\\nbeen promising her to give glory to Achilles, and to kill much people\\nat the ships of the Achaeans.\" \\n\\n\"Wife,\" said Jove, \"I can do nothing but you suspect me and find it\\nout. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the\\nmore, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say;\\nI mean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for\\nif I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were\\non your side it would profit you nothing.\" \\n\\nOn this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat\\ndown in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout\\nthe house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and\\npacify his mother Juno. \"It will be intolerable,\" said he, \"if you\\ntwo fall to wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack\\nof mortals. If such ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no\\npleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my mother- and she must\\nherself know that it will be better- to make friends with my dear\\nfather Jove, lest he again scold her and disturb our feast. If the\\nOlympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from our seats, he can do\\nso, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair words, and he will\\nthen soon be in a good humour with us.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his\\nmother\\'s hand. \"Cheer up, my dear mother,\" said he, \"and make the\\nbest of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you\\nget a thrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help for\\nthere is no standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to\\nhelp you, he caught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly\\nthreshold. All day long from morn till eve, was I falling, till at\\nsunset I came to ground in the island of Lemnos, and there I lay,\\nwith very little life left in me, till the Sintians came and tended\\nme.\" \\n\\nJuno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her son\\'s\\nhands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served\\nit round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed\\ngods laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ing bustling about\\nthe heavenly mansion. \\n\\nThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted,\\nand every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied. Apollo\\nstruck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices, calling\\nand answering one another. But when the sun\\'s glorious light had faded,\\nthey went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame Vulcan with\\nhis consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove, the Olympian\\nLord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always slept; and\\nwhen he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden\\nthrone by his side. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK II\\n\\nNow the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly,\\nbut Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to Achilles,\\nand destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In the end\\nhe deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King Agamemnon;\\nso he called one to him and said to it, \"Lying Dream, go to the ships\\nof the Achaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word to\\nword as I now bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under\\narms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels\\namong the gods; Juno has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides\\nthe Trojans.\" \\n\\nThe dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the\\nships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found\\nhim in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his\\nhead in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured\\nabove all his councillors, and said:- \\n\\n\"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his host\\nand so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear\\nme at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who, though he be\\nnot near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get\\nthe Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There\\nare no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them\\nover to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of\\nJove. Remember this, and when you wake see that it does not escape\\nyou.\" \\n\\nThe dream then left him, and he thought of things that were, surely\\nnot to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he was to\\ntake the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of\\nJove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store alike for Danaans\\nand Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the divine message still\\nringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt\\nso fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals\\non to his comely feet, and slung his silver-studded sword about his\\nshoulders; then he took the imperishable staff of his father, and\\nsallied forth to the ships of the Achaeans. \\n\\nThe goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might\\nherald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent\\nthe criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them\\nand the people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of\\nthe elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were\\nassembled he laid a cunning counsel before them. \\n\\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"I have had a dream from heaven in the dead\\nof night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor\\'s. It\\nhovered over my head and said, \\'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one\\nwho has the welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shoulders\\nshould dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from\\nJove, who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities\\nyou. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall\\ntake Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno\\nhas brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans\\nat the hands of Jove. Remember this.\\' The dream then vanished and\\nI awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of the Achaeans. But\\nit will be well that I should first sound them, and to this end I\\nwill tell them to fly with their ships; but do you others go about\\namong the host and prevent their doing so.\" \\n\\nHe then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all sincerity\\nand goodwill addressed them thus: \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes\\nand councillors of the Argives, if any other man of the Achaeans had\\ntold us of this dream we should have declared it false, and would\\nhave had nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it is the foremost\\nman among us; we must therefore set about getting the people under\\narms.\" \\n\\nWith this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred\\nkings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the\\npeople pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally\\nfrom some hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring\\nflowers, bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude\\npour from ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon\\nthe wide-watered shore, while among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger\\nof Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-mell\\nof mad confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as\\nthe people sought their places. Nine heralds went crying about among\\nthem to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till at\\nlast they were got into their several places and ceased their clamour.\\nThen King Agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. This was the work of\\nVulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. Jove gave it to Mercury,\\nslayer of Argus, guide and guardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops,\\nthe mighty charioteer, and Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people.\\nAtreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes\\nin his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord\\nof all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed\\nthe Argives. \\n\\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven\\nhas been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise\\nthat I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has\\nplayed me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos\\nwith the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid\\nmany a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his\\npower is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean\\nhost, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against men fewer\\nin number than themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think\\nthat the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and\\nthat they have each been numbered- the Trojans by the roll of their\\nhouseholders, and we by companies of ten; think further that each\\nof our companies desired to have a Trojan householder to pour out\\ntheir wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many a company\\nwould have to go without its cup-bearer. But they have in the town\\nallies from other places, and it is these that hinder me from being\\nable to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of Jove years are gone;\\nthe timbers of our ships have rotted; their tackling is sound no longer.\\nOur wives and little ones at home look anxiously for our coming, but\\nthe work that we came hither to do has not been done. Now, therefore,\\nlet us all do as I say: let us sail back to our own land, for we shall\\nnot take Troy.\" \\n\\nWith these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of\\nthem as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to\\nand fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south\\nwinds break from heaven\\'s clouds to lash them; or as when the west\\nwind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast,\\neven so were they swayed as they flew with loud cries towards the\\nships, and the dust from under their feet rose heavenward. They cheered\\neach other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels\\nin front of them; they began taking away the stays from underneath\\nthem, and the welkin rang with their glad cries, so eager were they\\nto return. \\n\\nThen surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that was\\nnot fated. But Juno said to Minerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing\\nJove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over\\nthe broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still\\nkeeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at\\nTroy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak\\nfairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into the\\nsea.\" \\n\\nMinerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the\\ntopmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of\\nthe Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, standing\\nalone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grieved\\nand sorry; so she went close up to him and said, \"Ulysses, noble son\\nof Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and\\nbe off home to your own land in this way? Will you leave Priam and\\nthe Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many\\nof the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about\\nat once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man, that\\nthey draw not their ships into the sea.\" \\n\\nUlysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak\\nfrom him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca,\\nwho waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went\\nstraight up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral, imperishable\\nstaff. With this he went about among the ships of the Achaeans.\\n\\nWhenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke him\\nfairly. \"Sir,\" said he, \"this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand\\nto your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not\\nyet know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere long\\nwill visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of us\\nat the council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry\\nand do us a mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and the hand\\nof Jove is with them.\" \\n\\nBut when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he\\nstruck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, \"Sirrah, hold your\\npeace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward and\\nno soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all\\nbe kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one man\\nmust be supreme- one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has given\\nthe sceptre of sovereignty over you all.\" \\n\\nThus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people hurried\\nback to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as the\\nthunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and all\\nthe sea is in an uproar. \\n\\nThe rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places,\\nbut Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue- a man of\\nmany words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a railer against\\nall who were in authority, who cared not what he said, so that he\\nmight set the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest man of all those\\nthat came before Troy- bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two\\nshoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a\\npoint, but there was little hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses\\nhated him worst of all, for it was with them that he was most wont\\nto wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he began heaping\\nhis abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and disgusted, yet\\nnone the less he kept on brawling and bawling at the son of Atreus.\\n\\n\"Agamemnon,\" he cried, \"what ails you now, and what more do you want?\\nYour tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever\\nwe take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have yet more\\ngold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when\\nI or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some young girl\\nto hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans,\\nshould bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards, women rather\\nthan men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to\\nstew in his own meeds of honour, and discover whether we were of any\\nservice to him or no. Achilles is a much better man than he is, and\\nsee how he has treated him- robbing him of his prize and keeping it\\nhimself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son\\nof Atreus, you would never again insult him.\" \\n\\nThus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and rebuked\\nhim sternly. \"Check your glib tongue, Thersites,\" said be, \"and babble\\nnot a word further. Chide not with princes when you have none to back\\nyou. There is no viler creature come before Troy with the sons of\\nAtreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them nor\\nkeep harping about going home. We do not yet know how things are going\\nto be, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with good success or\\nevil. How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded\\nhim so many prizes? I tell you, therefore- and it shall surely be-\\nthat if I again catch you talking such nonsense, I will either forfeit\\nmy own head and be no more called father of Telemachus, or I will\\ntake you, strip you stark naked, and whip you out of the assembly\\ntill you go blubbering back to the ships.\" \\n\\nOn this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till\\nhe dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody\\nweal on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish\\nas he wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him,\\nyet they laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying,\\n\"Ulysses has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council,\\nbut he never did the Argives a better turn than when he stopped this\\nfellow\\'s mouth from prating further. He will give the kings no more\\nof his insolence.\" \\n\\nThus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and Minerva\\nin the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those who\\nwere far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore\\nwith all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:- \\n\\n\"King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among all\\nmankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out from\\nArgos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of\\nTroy, and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set\\noff homeward. True it is that they have had toil enough to be disheartened.\\nA man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even for a single\\nmonth, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but\\nit is now nine long years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore,\\nblame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed\\nif we go home empty after so long a stay- therefore, my friends, be\\npatient yet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings\\nof Calchas were false or true. \\n\\n\"All who have not since perished must remember as though it were yesterday\\nor the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were detained in\\nAulis when we were on our way hither to make war on Priam and the\\nTrojans. We were ranged round about a fountain offering hecatombs\\nto the gods upon their holy altars, and there was a fine plane-tree\\nfrom beneath which there welled a stream of pure water. Then we saw\\na prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out of the ground, with\\nblood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from under the altar\\non to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of young sparrows, quite\\nsmall, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves,\\neight in all, and their mother that hatched them made nine. The serpent\\nate the poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting\\nher little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught\\nher by the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had eaten both\\nthe sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him become\\na sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into stone, and\\nwe stood there wondering at that which had come to pass. Seeing, then,\\nthat such a fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, Calchas\\nforthwith declared to us the oracles of heaven. \\'Why, Achaeans,\\' said\\nhe, \\'are you thus speechless? Jove has sent us this sign, long in\\ncoming, and long ere it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for\\never. As the serpent ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that\\nhatched them, which makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at Troy,\\nbut in the tenth shall take the town.\\' This was what he said, and\\nnow it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, all of you, till\\nwe take the city of Priam.\" \\n\\nOn this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with\\nthe uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. \"Shame\\non you,\" he cried, \"to stay talking here like children, when you should\\nfight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that\\nwe have taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our\\ndrink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have\\nput our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our talking\\nhere shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of Atreus,\\nby your own steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on to battle, and\\nleave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain,\\nto get back to Argos ere they have learned whether Jove be true or\\na liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that we should\\nsucceed, when we Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon\\nthe Trojans. He showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning\\non our right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has\\nfirst lain with the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and\\nsorrow that he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if\\nany man is in such haste to be at home again, let him lay his hand\\nto his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all. But, O\\nking, consider and give ear to my counsel, for the word that I say\\nmay not be neglected lightly. Divide your men, Agamemnon, into their\\nseveral tribes and clans, that clans and tribes may stand by and help\\none another. If you do this, and if the Achaeans obey you, you will\\nfind out who, both chiefs and peoples, are brave, and who are cowards;\\nfor they will vie against the other. Thus you shall also learn whether\\nit is through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice of man that you\\nshall fail to take the town.\" \\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, you have again outdone the sons of\\nthe Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo,\\nthat I had among them ten more such councillors, for the city of King\\nPriam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it.\\nBut the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless wranglings and strife.\\nAchilles and I are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter I\\nwas the first to offend; if we can be of one mind again, the Trojans\\nwill not stave off destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your\\nmorning meal, that our hosts join in fight. Whet well your spears;\\nsee well to the ordering of your shields; give good feeds to your\\nhorses, and look your chariots carefully over, that we may do battle\\nthe livelong day; for we shall have no rest, not for a moment, till\\nnight falls to part us. The bands that bear your shields shall be\\nwet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your hands shall weary upon\\nyour spears, your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, and\\nif I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at\\nthe ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey\\nto dogs and vultures.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves\\nrun high before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty\\nheadland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as\\nthe storms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans\\nrise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted\\ntheir fires at their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice every\\nman to one or other of the gods, and praying each one of them that\\nhe might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed\\na fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of Saturn, and invited\\nthe princes and elders of his host. First he asked Nestor and King\\nIdomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly\\nUlysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his own accord,\\nfor he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round the bull\\nwith the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed, saying,\\n\"Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, and ridest\\nupon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, nor the\\nnight fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gates are\\nconsumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt of Hector\\nabout his heart, and that full many of his comrades may bite the dust\\nas they fall dying round him.\" \\n\\nThus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer.\\nHe accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil\\ncontinually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal\\nupon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed\\nit. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers\\nof fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These they\\nburned upon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inward\\nmeats, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-bones were\\nburned, and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up\\nsmall, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done,\\nand drew them off; then, when they had finished their work and the\\nfeast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so\\nthat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\\ndrink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. \"King Agamemnon,\"\\nsaid he, \"let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the work that\\nheaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds summon the people to\\ngather at their several ships; we will then go about among the host,\\nthat we may begin fighting at once.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent\\nthe criers round to call the people in assembly. So they called them,\\nand the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of Atreus\\nchose their men and marshalled them, while Minerva went among them\\nholding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death. From\\nit there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven, and\\neach one of them worth a hundred oxen. With this she darted furiously\\neverywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, urging them forward, and\\nputting courage into the heart of each, so that he might fight and\\ndo battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in their eyes even\\nthan returning home in their ships. As when some great forest fire\\nis raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so\\nas they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the firmament\\nof heaven. \\n\\nThey were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the plain\\nabout the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and thither,\\nglorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the\\nfen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribes pour\\nfrom ships and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and the ground\\nrang as brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood as thick\\nupon the flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in summer.\\n\\nAs countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman\\'s homestead in\\nthe time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even so\\ndid the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and destroy\\nthem. \\n\\nThe chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight began,\\ndrafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flocks when they\\nhave got mixed while feeding; and among them went King Agamemnon,\\nwith a head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waist like Mars,\\nand a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull that lords it\\nover the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make the son of Atreus\\nstand peerless among the multitude of heroes. \\n\\nAnd now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me- for\\nyou are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things,\\nwhile we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs and princes\\nof the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so that I could\\nnot name every single one of them though I had ten tongues, and though\\nmy voice failed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless\\nyou, O Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount\\nthem to me. Nevertheless, I will tell the captains of the ships and\\nall the fleet together. \\n\\nPeneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains\\nof the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis,\\nand who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with\\nThespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma,\\nEilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea\\nand the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the\\nhaunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and\\nGlisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous\\ngrove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and\\nAnthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in each\\nthere were a hundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians.\\n\\nAscalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt in\\nAspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble maiden\\nbore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had gone with\\nMars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with her. With\\nthese there came thirty ships. \\n\\nThe Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty\\nIphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus,\\nrocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt\\nin Anemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus,\\nand Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains\\ncame forty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans,\\nwhich were stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.\\n\\nAjax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not\\nso great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was\\na little man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of\\nthe spear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt\\nin Cynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, and\\nThronium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships\\nof the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea. \\n\\nThe fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,\\nHistiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perched\\ntown of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra; Elephenor\\nof the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son of Chalcodon,\\nand chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleet of foot\\nand wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would ever\\nstrive to tear open the corslets of their foes with their long ashen\\nspears. Of these there came fifty ships. \\n\\nAnd they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great\\nErechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove\\'s daughter,\\nMinerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own rich\\nsanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him with\\nsacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus,\\nson of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the marshalling of\\nchariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone rival him, for he was\\nolder. With him there came fifty ships. \\n\\nAjax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside\\nthose of the Athenians. \\n\\nThe men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns, with\\nHermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the vineyard\\nlands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came from Aegina\\nand Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud battle-cry, and Sthenelus\\nson of famed Capaneus. With them in command was Euryalus, son of king\\nMecisteus, son of Talaus; but Diomed was chief over them all. With\\nthese there came eighty ships. \\n\\nThose who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae;\\nOrneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old; Hyperesia,\\nhigh Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-land round about\\nHelice; these sent a hundred ships under the command of King Agamemnon,\\nson of Atreus. His force was far both finest and most numerous, and\\nin their midst was the king himself, all glorious in his armour of\\ngleaming bronze- foremost among the heroes, for he was the greatest\\nking, and had most men under him. \\n\\nAnd those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills, Pharis,\\nSparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae, Amyclae, and\\nHelos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; these were led by\\nMenelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and of them\\nthere were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others. Among them\\nwent Menelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for\\nhe longed to avenge the toil and sorrow that he had suffered for the\\nsake of Helen. \\n\\nThe men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the river\\nAlpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum, Helos,\\nand Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy\\nfor ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytus lived and\\nreigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses, daughters\\nof aegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing against him; whereon they\\nwere angry, and maimed him. They robbed him of his divine power of\\nsong, and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These were\\ncommanded by Nestor, knight of Gerene, and with him there came ninety\\nships. \\n\\nAnd those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene, near\\nthe tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the men\\nof Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie,\\nand bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus and Parrhasia;\\nof these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, and they had\\nsixty ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in each one of them,\\nbut Agamemnon found them the ships in which to cross the sea, for\\nthey were not a people that occupied their business upon the waters.\\n\\nThe men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is enclosed\\nbetween Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock Olene and Alesium.\\nThese had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships, with many\\nEpeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachus and Thalpius- the\\none, son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus- both of the race of\\nActor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynces, and Polyxenus,\\nson of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas. \\n\\nAnd those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt\\nbeyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, and\\nthe son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with his\\nfather, and went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came forty\\nships. \\n\\nUlysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum with\\nits forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, with\\nthe mainland also that was over against the islands. These were led\\nby Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelve\\nships. \\n\\nThoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in Pleuron,\\nOlenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for the great\\nking Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was also\\ngolden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetolians to be\\ntheir king. And with Thoas there came forty ships. \\n\\nThe famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,\\nand the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and Lycastus\\nthat lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus and Rhytium,\\nwith the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete.\\nAll these were led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of murderous\\nMars. And with these there came eighty ships. \\n\\nTlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of stature,\\nbrought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These dwelt in\\nRhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindus, Ielysus,\\nand Cameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These were commanded by Tlepolemus,\\nson of Hercules by Astyochea, whom he had carried off from Ephyra,\\non the river Selleis, after sacking many cities of valiant warriors.\\nWhen Tlepolemus grew up, he killed his father\\'s uncle Licymnius, who\\nhad been a famous warrior in his time, but was then grown old. On\\nthis he built himself a fleet, gathered a great following, and fled\\nbeyond the sea, for he was menaced by the other sons and grandsons\\nof Hercules. After a voyage. during which he suffered great hardship,\\nhe came to Rhodes, where the people divided into three communities,\\naccording to their tribes, and were dearly loved by Jove, the lord,\\nof gods and men; wherefore the son of Saturn showered down great riches\\nupon them. \\n\\nAnd Nireus brought three ships from Syme- Nireus, who was the handsomest\\nman that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus-\\nbut he was a man of no substance, and had but a small following.\\n\\nAnd those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the city\\nof Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commanded by Pheidippus\\nand Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son of Hercules. And\\nwith them there came thirty ships. \\n\\nThose again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; and\\nthose of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were called\\nMyrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over which\\nAchilles was in command. But they now took no part in the war, inasmuch\\nas there was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed by his ships,\\nfurious about the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he had taken from\\nLyrnessus at his own great peril, when he had sacked Lyrnessus and\\nThebe, and had overthrown Mynes and Epistrophus, sons of king Evenor,\\nson of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still grieving, but ere\\nlong he was again to join them. \\n\\nAnd those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus, sanctuary\\nof Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea, and Pteleum\\nthat lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaus had been\\ncaptain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under the earth.\\nHe had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeks in sorrow,\\nand his house was only half finished, for he was slain by a Dardanian\\nwarrior while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil of Troy.\\nStill, though his people mourned their chieftain, they were not without\\na leader, for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled them; he was\\nson of Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son of Phylacus, and he\\nwas own brother to Protesilaus, only younger, Protesilaus being at\\nonce the elder and the more valiant. So the people were not without\\na leader, though they mourned him whom they had lost. With him there\\ncame forty ships. \\n\\nAnd those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe, Glaphyrae,\\nand the populous city of Iolcus, these with their eleven ships were\\nled by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore to him, loveliest\\nof the daughters of Pelias. \\n\\nAnd those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and rugged\\nOlizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and they\\nhad seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good archers;\\nbut Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the Island of Lemnos, where\\nthe sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had been bitten by a poisonous\\nwater snake. There he lay sick and sorry, and full soon did the Argives\\ncome to miss him. But his people, though they felt his loss were not\\nleaderless, for Medon, the bastard son of Oileus by Rhene, set them\\nin array. \\n\\nThose, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they that\\nheld Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were commanded\\nby the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of healing, Podalirius\\nand Machaon. And with them there came thirty ships. \\n\\nThe men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia, with\\nthose that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus, these were\\nled by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them there came forty\\nships. \\n\\nThose that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white city\\nof Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was son of Pirithous,\\nwho was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him to Pirithous\\non the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain savages\\nand drove them from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoetes was\\nnot sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the race of Mars,\\nwho was son of Coronus, the son of Caeneus. And with these there came\\nforty ships. \\n\\nGuneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followed\\nby the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona,\\nand held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sends\\nits waters into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver eddies\\nof the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for the Titaresius\\nis a branch of dread Orcus and of the river Styx. \\n\\nOf the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They were\\nthey that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleet\\nof foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.\\n\\nSuch were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O Muse,\\nwas the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that followed\\nafter the sons of Atreus? \\n\\nOf the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest.\\nThey were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They were\\nof the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo,\\nof the silver bow, had bred them in Perea- both of them mares, and\\nterrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was\\nmuch the foremost so long as Achilles\\' anger lasted, for Achilles\\nexcelled him greatly and he had also better horses; but Achilles was\\nnow holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel with Agamemnon,\\nand his people passed their time upon the sea shore, throwing discs\\nor aiming with spears at a mark, and in archery. Their horses stood\\neach by his own chariot, champing lotus and wild celery. The chariots\\nwere housed under cover, but their owners, for lack of leadership,\\nwandered hither and thither about the host and went not forth to fight.\\n\\nThus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned\\nbeneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land\\nabout Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even\\nso did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.\\n\\nAnd now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad\\nnews among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young,\\nat Priam\\'s gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the\\nvoice of Priam\\'s son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed\\nas watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes, to look out\\nfor any sally of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke, saying,\\n\"Old man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war is at hand.\\nI have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such a host as is\\nnow advancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city as thick\\nas leaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you above all\\nothers, do as I say. There are many allies dispersed about the city\\nof Priam from distant places and speaking divers tongues. Therefore,\\nlet each chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally\\nin array and leading them forth to battle.\" \\n\\nThus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at once\\nbroke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were opened,\\nand the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the tramp\\nas of a great multitude. \\n\\nNow there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon the\\nplain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb\\nof lithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.\\n\\nPriam\\'s son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the Trojans,\\nand with him were arrayed by far the greater number and most valiant\\nof those who were longing for the fray. \\n\\nThe Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to Anchises,\\nwhen she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the mountain\\nslopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two sons of\\nAntenor, Archilochus and Acamas, both skilled in all the arts of war.\\n\\nThey that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men of\\nsubstance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are of\\nTrojan blood- these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollo\\nhad taught to use the bow. \\n\\nThey that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia, and\\nthe high mountain of Tereia- these were led by Adrestus and Amphius,\\nwhose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops of Percote,\\nwho excelled in all kinds of divination. He told them not to take\\npart in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured them to\\ndestruction. \\n\\nThey that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, and\\nArisbe- these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave commander-\\nAsius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, of\\nthe breed that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.\\n\\nHippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in fertile\\nLarissa- Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons of\\nthe Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus. \\n\\nAcamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those that\\ncame from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont. \\n\\nEuphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the Ciconian\\nspearsmen. \\n\\nPyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the broad\\nwaters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the earth.\\n\\nThe Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from\\nEnetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held\\nCytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river\\nParthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini. \\n\\nOdius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant\\nAlybe, where there are mines of silver. \\n\\nChromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in\\naugury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by the\\nhand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slew\\nothers also of the Trojans. \\n\\nPhorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far\\ncountry of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray. \\n\\nMesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes,\\nborn to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dwelt\\nunder Mt. Tmolus. \\n\\nNastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held Miletus\\nand the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of the river Maeander\\nand the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were commanded by Nastes\\nand Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He came into the fight\\nwith gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold was of\\nno avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the\\nfleet descendant of Aeacus, and Achilles bore away his gold.\\n\\nSarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by the\\neddying waters of the Xanthus. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK III\\n\\nWhen the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,\\nthe Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream\\noverhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters of\\nOceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle\\nin the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently, in high\\nheart, and minded to stand by one another. \\n\\nAs when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain\\ntops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man\\ncan see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust\\nfrom under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.\\n\\nWhen they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward\\nas champion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin\\nof a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears\\nshod with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to\\nmeet him in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before\\nthe ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase\\nof some goat or horned stag, and devours it there and then, though\\ndogs and youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his\\neyes caught sight of Alexandrus, for he deemed that now he should\\nbe revenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit\\nof armour. \\n\\nAlexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in\\nfear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted,\\ntrembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some\\nmountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the throng of Trojan\\nwarriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son Atreus.\\n\\nThen Hector upbraided him. \"Paris,\" said he, \"evil-hearted Paris,\\nfair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had\\nnever been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live\\nto be disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock\\nat us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to\\nsee but who has neither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you\\nare, get your following together and sail beyond the seas? Did you\\nnot from your a far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among\\na people of warriors- to bring sorrow upon your father, your city,\\nand your whole country, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness\\nto yourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what\\nmanner of man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would\\nbe your lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair\\nfavour, when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are\\na weak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones\\nfor the wrongs you have done them.\" \\n\\nAnd Alexandrus answered, \"Hector, your rebuke is just. You are hard\\nas the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the\\ntimber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge\\nof your scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus\\nhas given me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the\\ngods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for the\\nasking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans\\nand Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in their midst\\nfor Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and\\nprove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear\\nthem to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace\\nwhereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the others go home\\nto Argos and the land of the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nWhen Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan\\nranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they\\nall sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at him with\\nstones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying, \"Hold, Argives,\\nshoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak.\"\\n\\nThey ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. \"Hear\\nfrom my mouth,\" said he, \"Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of Alexandrus,\\nthrough whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and\\nAchaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight\\nin the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall\\nbe victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all\\nshe has, to bear them to his own home, but let the rest swear to a\\nsolemn covenant of peace.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of the\\nloud battle-cry addressed them. \"And now,\" he said, \"hear me too,\\nfor it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of\\nAchaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much\\nhave suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did\\nme. Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more.\\nBring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and\\nSun, and we will bring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priam\\ncome, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his sons are\\nhigh-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must not be transgressed\\nor taken in vain. Young men\\'s minds are light as air, but when an\\nold man comes he looks before and after, deeming that which shall\\nbe fairest upon both sides.\" \\n\\nThe Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they\\nthought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots\\ntoward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying\\nit down upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with\\na little space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city\\nto bring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius\\nto fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had\\nsaid. \\n\\nMeanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law, wife\\nof the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodice,\\nthe fairest of Priam\\'s daughters. She found her in her own room, working\\nat a great web of purple linen, on which she was embroidering the\\nbattles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had made them fight\\nfor her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said, \"Come hither,\\nchild, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and Achaeans till\\nnow they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle,\\nbut now they have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields,\\nsitting still with their spears planted beside them. Alexandrus and\\nMenelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to the the\\nwife of him who is the victor.\" \\n\\nThus spoke the goddess, and Helen\\'s heart yearned after her former\\nhusband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over\\nher head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone,\\nbut attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus,\\nand Clymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.\\n\\nThe two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were seated\\nby the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus, Clytius,\\nand Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to fight, but\\nthey were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrup\\ndelicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. When they\\nsaw Helen coming towards the tower, they said softly to one another,\\n\"Small wonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endure so much and\\nso long, for the sake of a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely.\\nStill, fair though she be, let them take her and go, or she will breed\\nsorrow for us and for our children after us.\" \\n\\nBut Priam bade her draw nigh. \"My child,\" said he, \"take your seat\\nin front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen\\nand your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you\\nwho are to blame. It is they that have brought about this terrible\\nwar with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great\\nand goodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and\\nso royal. Surely he must be a king.\" \\n\\n\"Sir,\" answered Helen, \"father of my husband, dear and reverend in\\nmy eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here\\nwith your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling\\ndaughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to\\nbe, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the\\nhero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and\\na brave soldier, brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my\\nabhorred and miserable self.\" \\n\\nThe old man marvelled at him and said, \"Happy son of Atreus, child\\nof good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great\\nmultitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people\\nof Otreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river\\nSangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers\\nof men, came up against them, but even they were not so many as the\\nAchaeans.\" \\n\\nThe old man next looked upon Ulysses; \"Tell me,\" he said, \"who is\\nthat other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the\\nchest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks\\nin front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his\\newes.\" \\n\\nAnd Helen answered, \"He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of Laertes.\\nHe was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner of stratagems\\nand subtle cunning.\" \\n\\nOn this Antenor said, \"Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once\\ncame here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I received\\nthem in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and\\nconversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans,\\nMenelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses\\nhad the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their message,\\nand the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not\\nsay much, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly\\nand to the point, though he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses,\\non the other hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent and\\nkept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful\\nmovement of his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man\\nunpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for a mere churl\\nor simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came driving\\nfrom his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, then there was\\nnone to touch him, and no man thought further of what he looked like.\"\\n\\nPriam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, \"Who is that great and\\ngoodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest\\nof the Argives?\" \\n\\n\"That,\" answered Helen, \"is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, and\\non the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus looking\\nlike a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him. Often\\ndid Menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting\\nus from Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I\\ncould tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor,\\nbreaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they are children\\nof my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have not left\\nLacedaemon, or else, though they have brought their ships, they will\\nnot show themselves in battle for the shame and disgrace that I have\\nbrought upon them.\" \\n\\nShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earth\\nin their own land of Lacedaemon. \\n\\nMeanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through\\nthe city- two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and\\nIdaeus brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to\\nPriam and said, \"Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and Achaeans\\nbid you come down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant.\\nAlexandrus and Menelaus are to fight for Helen in single combat, that\\nshe and all her wealth may go with him who is the victor. We are to\\nswear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we others shall dwell\\nhere in Troy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the\\nAchaeans.\" \\n\\nThe old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the\\nhorses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,\\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him;\\nthey then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When they\\nreached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the chariot,\\nand with measured pace advanced into the space between the hosts.\\n\\nAgamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought\\non the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they\\npoured water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus\\ndrew the dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs\\'\\nheads; this the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean\\nprinces, and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. \"Father\\nJove,\" he cried, \"that rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and\\nthou oh Sun, that seest and givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers,\\nand ye who in the realms below chastise the soul of him that has broken\\nhis oath, witness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain.\\nIf Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and all her wealth,\\nwhile we sail home with our ships; but if Menelaus kills Alexandrus,\\nlet the Trojans give back Helen and all that she has; let them moreover\\npay such fine to the Achaeans as shall be agreed upon, in testimony\\namong those that shall be born hereafter. Aid if Priam and his sons\\nrefuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay here\\nand fight on till I have got satisfaction.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and\\nlaid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had\\nreft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl\\ninto the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans\\nand Achaeans among one another, \"Jove, most great and glorious, and\\nye other everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them who shall\\nfirst sin against their oaths- of them and their children- may be\\nshed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wives become\\nthe slaves of strangers.\" \\n\\nThus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.\\nThen Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, \"Hear me, Trojans\\nand Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius:\\nI dare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and\\nMenelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shall\\nfall.\" \\n\\nOn this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He\\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two\\nthen went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and\\ncast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first.\\nMeanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying, \"Father\\nJove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that he\\nwho first brought about this war between us may die, and enter the\\nhouse of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths.\"\\n\\nGreat Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,\\nand the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several\\nstations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying,\\nwhile Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly armour.\\nFirst he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted with\\nancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his brother\\nLycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded\\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On\\nhis comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair\\nthat nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spear\\nthat suited his hands. In like fashion Menelaus also put on his armour.\\n\\nWhen they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierce\\nof aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans were\\nstruck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on\\nthe measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against\\nthe other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the round shield of\\nthe son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield\\nturned its point. Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as\\nhe did so. \"King Jove,\" he said, \"grant me revenge on Alexandrus who\\nhas wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come\\na man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of his host.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of Alexandrus.\\nThrough shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt by his flank,\\nbut Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then the son\\nof Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part of his\\nhelmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces from his\\nhand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, \"Father Jove, of all gods\\nthou art the most despiteful; I made sure of my revenge, but the sword\\nhas broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I have\\nnot killed him.\" \\n\\nWith this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume\\nof his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The strap\\nof the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and Menelaus\\nwould have dragged him off to his own great glory had not Jove\\'s daughter\\nVenus been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that\\nthe empty helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades\\namong the Achaeans, and was again springing upon Alexandrus to run\\nhim through with a spear, but Venus snatched him up in a moment (as\\na god can do), hid him under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him\\nto his own bedchamber. \\n\\nThen she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with the\\nTrojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman\\nwho used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and\\nof whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed\\nrobe and said, \"Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to the\\nhouse; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed\\nin gorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just come from fighting,\\nbut rather that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was\\nsitting down.\" \\n\\nWith these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she marked\\nthe beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling\\neyes, she marvelled at her and said, \"Goddess, why do you thus beguile\\nme? Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom\\nyou have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished\\nAlexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with him. You are\\ncome here to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth\\nbe goddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to Olympus;\\nworry about him and look after him till he make you his wife, or,\\nfor the matter of that, his slave- but me? I shall not go; I can garnish\\nhis bed no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women of Troy.\\nBesides, I have trouble on my mind.\" \\n\\nVenus was very angry, and said, \"Bold hussy, do not provoke me; if\\nyou do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I have\\nloved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans,\\nand you shall come to a bad end.\" \\n\\nAt this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and\\nwent in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan\\nwomen. \\n\\nWhen they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set about\\ntheir work, but Helen went into her own room, and the laughter-loving\\ngoddess took a seat and set it for her facing Alexandrus. On this\\nHelen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down, and with eyes askance\\nbegan to upbraid her husband. \\n\\n\"So you are come from the fight,\" said she; \"would that you had fallen\\nrather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You used\\nto brag that you were a better man with hands and spear than Menelaus.\\ngo, but I then, an challenge him again- but I should advise you not\\nto do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet him in single combat,\\nyou will soon all by his spear.\" \\n\\nAnd Paris answered, \"Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches. This\\ntime, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me; another\\ntime I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will stand by\\nme. Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Never yet was\\nI so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment- not even when\\nI first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you-\\nnot even when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in the\\nisland of Cranae was I so enthralled by desire of you as now.\" On\\nthis he led her towards the bed, and his wife went with him.\\n\\nThus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus\\nstrode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no\\nman, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If\\nthey had seen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of\\nthem hated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men,\\nspoke, saying, \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory\\nhas been with Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all her wealth,\\nand pay such fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them\\nthat shall be born hereafter.\" \\n\\nThus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK IV\\n\\nNow the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor\\nwhile Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as\\nthey pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon\\nthe town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno, talking\\nat her so as to provoke her. \"Menelaus,\" said he, \"has two good friends\\namong the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva of Alalcomene, but\\nthey only sit still and look on, while Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus\\'\\nside to defend him in any danger; indeed she has just rescued him\\nwhen he made sure that it was all over with him- for the victory really\\ndid lie with Menelaus. We must consider what we shall do about all\\nthis; shall we set them fighting anew or make peace between them?\\nIf you will agree to this last Menelaus can take back Helen and the\\ncity of Priam may remain still inhabited.\" \\n\\nMinerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by side\\nhatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father,\\nfor she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but Juno\\ncould not contain herself. \"Dread son of Saturn,\" said she, \"what,\\npray, is the meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to go for nothing,\\nand the sweat that I have sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while\\ngetting the people together against Priam and his children? Do as\\nyou will, but we other gods shall not all of us approve your counsel.\"\\n\\nJove was angry and answered, \"My dear, what harm have Priam and his\\nsons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of Ilius?\\nWill nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat Priam\\nraw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it your\\nown way then; for I would not have this matter become a bone of contention\\nbetween us. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, if ever\\nI want to sack a city belonging to friends of yours, you must not\\ntry to stop me; you will have to let me do it, for I am giving in\\nto you sorely against my will. Of all inhabited cities under the sun\\nand stars of heaven, there was none that I so much respected as Ilius\\nwith Priam and his whole people. Equitable feasts were never wanting\\nabout my altar, nor the savour of burning fat, which is honour due\\nto ourselves.\" \\n\\n\"My own three favourite cities,\" answered Juno, \"are Argos, Sparta,\\nand Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased with them. I\\nshall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, and tried\\nto stay you, I should take nothing by it, for you are much stronger\\nthan I am, but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am a god\\nand of the same race with yourself. I am Saturn\\'s eldest daughter,\\nand am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I am your\\nwife, and you are king over the gods. Let it be a case, then, of give-and-take\\nbetween us, and the rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Minerva\\nto go and take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that\\nthe Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the\\nAchaeans.\" \\n\\nThe sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva, \"Go\\nat once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that the Trojans\\nshall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted\\nfrom the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as some\\nbrilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as a sign\\nto mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of light follows\\nin its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe as they\\nbeheld, and one would turn to his neighbour, saying, \"Either we shall\\nagain have war and din of combat, or Jove the lord of battle will\\nnow make peace between us.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus, son\\nof Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find Pandarus,\\nthe redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing among the stalwart\\nheroes who had followed him from the banks of the Aesopus, so she\\nwent close up to him and said, \"Brave son of Lycaon, will you do as\\nI tell you? If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus you will win honour\\nand thanks from all the Trojans, and especially from prince Alexandrus-\\nhe would be the first to requite you very handsomely if he could see\\nMenelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your hand.\\nTake your home aim then, and pray to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer;\\nvow that when you get home to your strong city of Zelea you will offer\\na hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.\" \\n\\nHis fool\\'s heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case.\\nThis bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed\\nas it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen\\nas the arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms\\nlong, and a worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them\\nwell down, and giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung\\nhis bow he laid it carefully on the ground, and his brave followers\\nheld their shields before him lest the Achaeans should set upon him\\nbefore he had shot Menelaus. Then he opened the lid of his quiver\\nand took out a winged arrow that had yet been shot, fraught with the\\npangs of death. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian\\nApollo, the famous archer, vowing that when he got home to his strong\\ncity of Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his\\nhonour. He laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and\\ndrew both notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near\\nthe bow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly,\\nand the bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly\\non over the heads of the throng. \\n\\nBut the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove\\'s daughter,\\ndriver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee and ward off\\nthe piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a mother whisks\\na fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly; she guided it\\nto the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed over\\nhis double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt that\\nwent tightly round him. It went right through this and through the\\ncuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the belt beneath it,\\nwhich he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows; it was this\\nthat served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went through\\nit and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood began flowing from\\nthe wound. \\n\\nAs when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a piece\\nof ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to be laid\\nup in a treasure house- many a knight is fain to bear it, but the\\nking keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and driver may be\\nproud- even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your legs\\ndown to your fair ancles stained with blood. \\n\\nWhen King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was afraid,\\nand so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbs of the\\narrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft were still\\noutside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaved a deep\\nsigh as he held Menelaus\\'s hand in his own, and his comrades made\\nmoan in concert. \"Dear brother, \"he cried, \"I have been the death\\nof you in pledging this covenant and letting you come forward as our\\nchampion. The Trojans have trampled on their oaths and have wounded\\nyou; nevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings\\nand the right hands of fellowship in which have put our trust shall\\nnot be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now,\\nhe. will yet fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their\\nlives and with their wives and children. The day will surely come\\nwhen mighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam\\'s people,\\nwhen the son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them\\nwith his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This\\nshall surely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your\\nlot now to die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans\\nwill at once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory\\nof still keeping Helen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie\\nhere at Troy with your purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggart\\nTrojan leap upon your tomb and say, \\'Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak\\nhis vengeance; he brought his army in vain; he is gone home to his\\nown land with empty ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.\\' Thus\\nwill one of them say, and may the earth then swallow me.\"\\n\\nBut Menelaus reassured him and said, \"Take heart, and do not alarm\\nthe people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer\\nbelt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass\\nand the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me.\" \\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be even\\nso, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it\\nto relieve your pain.\" \\n\\nHe then said to Talthybius, \"Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the\\ngreat physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately.\\nSome Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our\\ndismay, and to his own great glory.\" \\n\\nTalthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to find\\nMachaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors who had\\nfollowed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and said, \"Son\\nof Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and see Menelaus\\nimmediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an\\narrow to our dismay and to his own great glory.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed through\\nthe spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they came to the\\nplace where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying with the chieftains\\ngathered in a circle round him. Machaon passed into the middle of\\nthe ring and at once drew the arrow from the belt, bending its barbs\\nback through the force with which he pulled it out. He undid the burnished\\nbelt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt of mail which the\\nbronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped\\naway the blood and applied some soothing drugs which Chiron had given\\nto Aesculapius out of the good will he bore him. \\n\\nWhile they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forward\\nagainst them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed the\\nfight. \\n\\nYou would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and unwilling\\nto fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariot rich\\nwith bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son of\\nPtolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readiness\\nagainst the time his limbs should weary of going about and giving\\norders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw\\nmen hasting to the front he stood by them and cheered them on. \"Argives,\"\\nsaid he, \"slacken not one whit in your onset; father Jove will be\\nno helper of liars; the Trojans have been the first to break their\\noaths and to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured of vultures;\\nwe shall take their city and carry off their wives and children in\\nour ships.\" \\n\\nBut he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined\\nto fight. \"Argives,\" he cried, \"cowardly miserable creatures, have\\nyou no shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can\\nno longer scud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight?\\nYou are as dazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans\\nreach the sterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whether\\nthe son of Saturn will hold his hand over you to protect you?\"\\n\\nThus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing through\\nthe crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round Idomeneus,\\nwho was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while Meriones was bringing\\nup the battalions that were in the rear. Agamemnon was glad when he\\nsaw him, and spoke him fairly. \"Idomeneus,\" said he, \"I treat you\\nwith greater distinction than I do any others of the Achaeans, whether\\nin war or in other things, or at table. When the princes are mixing\\nmy choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed\\nallowance, but your cup is kept always full like my own, that you\\nmay drink whenever you are minded. Go, therefore, into battle, and\\nshow yourself the man you have been always proud to be.\"\\n\\nIdomeneus answered, \"I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised you\\nfrom the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we may\\njoin battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon their covenants.\\nDeath and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have been the first\\nto break their oaths and to attack us.\" \\n\\nThe son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the two\\nAjaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when a goat-herd\\nfrom some high post watches a storm drive over the deep before the\\nwest wind- black as pitch is the offing and a mighty whirlwind draws\\ntowards him, so that he is afraid and drives his flock into a cave-\\neven thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark mass to\\nbattle under the Ajaxes, horrid with shield and spear. Glad was King\\nAgamemnon when he saw them. \"No need,\" he cried, \"to give orders to\\nsuch leaders of the Argives as you are, for of your own selves you\\nspur your men on to fight with might and main. Would, by father Jove,\\nMinerva, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are, for the city\\nof Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack\\nit.\" \\n\\nWith this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker\\nof the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, in\\ncompany with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherd\\nof his people. He placed his knights with their chariots and horses\\nin the front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom\\nhe could trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle,\\nthat they might fight whether they would or no. He gave his orders\\nto the knights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand,\\nso as to avoid confusion. \"Let no man,\" he said, \"relying on his strength\\nor horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with the\\nTrojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your attack;\\nbut let each when he meets an enemy\\'s chariot throw his spear from\\nhis own; this be much the best; this is how the men of old took towns\\nand strongholds; in this wise were they minded.\" \\n\\nThus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight,\\nand King Agamemnon was glad. \"I wish,\" he said to him, that your limbs\\nwere as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but\\nage, the common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would\\nthat it had fallen upon some other, and that you were still young.\"\\n\\nAnd Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, \"Son of Atreus, I too would\\ngladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but the gods\\nwill not give us everything at one and the same time. I was then young,\\nand now I am old; still I can go with my knights and give them that\\ncounsel which old men have a right to give. The wielding of the spear\\nI leave to those who are younger and stronger than myself.\"\\n\\nAgamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,\\nson of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the Athenians\\nloud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning Ulysses, with\\nhis sturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not yet heard the battle-cry,\\nfor the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had only just begun to move,\\nso they were standing still, waiting for some other columns of the\\nAchaeans to attack the Trojans and begin the fighting. When he saw\\nthis Agamemnon rebuked them and said, \"Son of Peteos, and you other,\\nsteeped in cunning, heart of guile, why stand you here cowering and\\nwaiting on others? You two should be of all men foremost when there\\nis hard fighting to be done, for you are ever foremost to accept my\\ninvitation when we councillors of the Achaeans are holding feast.\\nYou are glad enough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink\\nwine as long as you please, whereas now you would not care though\\nyou saw ten columns of Achaeans engage the enemy in front of you.\"\\n\\nUlysses glared at him and answered, \"Son of Atreus, what are you talking\\nabout? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeans are in\\nfull fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to do so,\\nthat the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremost of\\nthem. You are talking idly.\" \\n\\nWhen Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly at\\nhim and withdrew his words. \"Ulysses,\" said he, \"noble son of Laertes,\\nexcellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders\\nto give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are\\nof a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and\\nif any ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing.\"\\n\\nHe then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son\\nof Tydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with\\nSthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to upbraid\\nhim. \"Son of Tydeus,\" he said, \"why stand you cowering here upon the\\nbrink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever ahead of\\nhis men when leading them on against the foe- so, at least, say they\\nthat saw him in battle, for I never set eyes upon him myself. They\\nsay that there was no man like him. He came once to Mycenae, not as\\nan enemy but as a guest, in company with Polynices to recruit his\\nforces, for they were levying war against the strong city of Thebes,\\nand prayed our people for a body of picked men to help them. The men\\nof Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but Jove dissuaded them\\nby showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus, therefore, and Polynices\\nwent their way. When they had got as far the deep-meadowed and rush-grown\\nbanks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as their envoy, and\\nhe found the Cadmeans gathered in great numbers to a banquet in the\\nhouse of Eteocles. Stranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding\\nhimself single-handed among so many, but challenged them to contests\\nof all kinds, and in each one of them was at once victorious, so mightily\\ndid Minerva help him. The Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and\\nset a force of fifty youths with two captains- the godlike hero Maeon,\\nson of Haemon, and Polyphontes, son of Autophonus- at their head,\\nto lie in wait for him on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every\\nman of them, save only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven\\'s\\nomens. Such was Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but\\nhe cannot fight as his father did.\" \\n\\nDiomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon;\\nbut the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, \"Son of Atreus,\\ntell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boast ourselves\\nas even better men than our fathers; we took seven-gated Thebes, though\\nthe wall was stronger and our men were fewer in number, for we trusted\\nin the omens of the gods and in the help of Jove, whereas they perished\\nthrough their own sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in like\\nhonour with us.\" \\n\\nDiomed looked sternly at him and said, \"Hold your peace, my friend,\\nas I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge the Achaeans\\nforward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, and his the\\nshame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us acquit ourselves with\\nvalour.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so fiercely\\nabout his body that even a brave man might well have been scared to\\nhear it. \\n\\nAs when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west\\nwind has lashed it into fury- it has reared its head afar and now\\ncomes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high over\\nthe jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions- even so\\ndid the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly to battle.\\nThe chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but the men said never\\na word; no man would think it, for huge as the host was, it seemed\\nas though there was not a tongue among them, so silent were they in\\ntheir obedience; and as they marched the armour about their bodies\\nglistened in the sun. But the clamour of the Trojan ranks was as that\\nof many thousand ewes that stand waiting to be milked in the yards\\nof some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating\\nof their lambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but their\\ntongues were diverse, and they came from many different places. These\\nwere inspired of Mars, but the others by Minerva- and with them came\\nPanic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister and friend\\nof murderous Mars, who, from being at first but low in stature, grows\\ntill she uprears her head to heaven, though her feet are still on\\nearth. She it was that went about among them and flung down discord\\nto the waxing of sorrow with even hand between them. \\n\\nWhen they were got together in one place shield clashed with shield\\nand spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed shields beat\\none upon another, and there was a tramp as of a great multitude- death-cry\\nand shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with\\nblood. As torrents swollen with rain course madly down their deep\\nchannels till the angry floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd\\nthe hillside hears their roaring from afar- even such was the toil\\nand uproar of the hosts as they joined in battle. \\n\\nFirst Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,\\nson of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at the\\nprojecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the\\npoint of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; headlong\\nas a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he dropped\\nKing Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and captain of the proud Abantes\\nbegan dragging him out of reach of the darts that were falling around\\nhim, in haste to strip him of his armour. But his purpose was not\\nfor long; Agenor saw him haling the body away, and smote him in the\\nside with his bronze-shod spear- for as he stooped his side was left\\nunprotected by his shield- and thus he perished. Then the fight between\\nTrojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew upon\\neach other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.\\n\\nForthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius, son\\nof Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois, as\\nshe was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with her parents\\nto see their flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but he did\\nnot live to pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off untimely\\nby the spear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast by the right\\nnipple as he was coming on among the foremost fighters; the spear\\nwent right through his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has\\ngrown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick\\nwith branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that\\nhe may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and\\nit lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell to\\nearth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the gleaming\\ncorslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid the crowd\\nand missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of Ulysses, in\\nthe groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over to the other\\nside; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it. Ulysses\\nwas furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armour through\\nthe front ranks till he was quite close; then he glared round about\\nhim and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he did so. His dart\\nwas not sped in vain, for it struck Democoon, the bastard son of Priam,\\nwho had come to him from Abydos, where he had charge of his father\\'s\\nmares. Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with\\nhis spear on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the\\nother side of his forehead. Thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and\\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\\nHector, and they that were in front, then gave round while the Argives\\nraised a shout and drew off the dead, pressing further forward as\\nthey did so. But Apollo looked down from Pergamus and called aloud\\nto the Trojans, for he was displeased. \"Trojans,\" he cried, \"rush\\non the foe, and do not let yourselves be thus beaten by the Argives.\\nTheir skins are not stone nor iron that when hit them you do them\\nno harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son of lovely Thetis, is not fighting,\\nbut is nursing his anger at the ships.\" \\n\\nThus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while Jove\\'s\\nredoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the host of\\nthe Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them slackening.\\n\\nThen fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck by\\na jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled it\\nwas Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had come\\nfrom Aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed by the pitiless\\nstone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his death throes\\nstretched out his hands towards his comrades. But Peirous, who had\\nwounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into his belly, so that\\nhis bowels came gushing out upon the ground, and darkness veiled his\\neyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of Aetolia struck him in the\\nchest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself in his lungs. Thoas\\ncame close up to him, pulled the spear out of his chest, and then\\ndrawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so that he\\ndied; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his Thracian comrades,\\nmen who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads, stood\\nround the body and kept him off with their long spears for all his\\ngreat stature and valour; so he was driven back. Thus the two corpses\\nlay stretched on earth near to one another, the one captain of the\\nThracians and the other of the Epeans; and many another fell round\\nthem. \\n\\nAnd now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could have\\ngone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva leading\\nhim by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and arrows.\\nFor many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side\\nface downwards upon the earth. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK V\\n\\nThen Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus,\\nthat he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself with\\nglory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet\\nlike the star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath\\nin the waters of Oceanus- even such a fire did she kindle upon his\\nhead and shoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly\\nof the fight. \\n\\nNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,\\npriest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus\\nand Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two\\ncame forward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he\\nbeing on foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were\\nclose up to one another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went\\nover Diomed\\'s left shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw,\\nand his spear sped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near\\nthe nipple, and he fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride\\nhis brother\\'s body, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight,\\nor he would have shared his brother\\'s fate; whereon Vulcan saved him\\nby wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old father might\\nnot be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus drove\\noff with the horses, and bade his followers take them to the ships.\\nThe Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of\\nthem in fright and the other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore,\\ntook Mars by the hand and said, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained\\nstormer of cities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to\\nfight it out, and see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the\\nvictory? Let us go away, and thus avoid his anger.\" \\n\\nSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon\\nthe steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the\\nTrojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First\\nKing Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his\\nchariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,\\njust as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders\\nand went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round\\nhim as he fell heavily to the ground. \\n\\nThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come\\nfrom Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as\\nhe was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded\\nhim as he fell heavily from the car. \\n\\nThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus,\\nson of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman\\nand keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill\\nevery kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but\\nneither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for\\nthe spear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it\\nstruck him between the shoulders and went right through his chest,\\nso that he fell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.\\n\\nMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son\\nof Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning workmanship,\\nfor Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that made the ships\\nfor Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all mischief, and brought\\nevil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus himself; for he heeded\\nnot the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him as he was flying,\\nand struck him on the right buttock. The point of the spear went through\\nthe bone into the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud\\nand fell forward on his knees. \\n\\nMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was\\na bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children,\\nfor the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up\\nto him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under\\nhis tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell\\ndead in the dust. \\n\\nAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble Dolopion,\\nwho had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was honoured\\namong the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him chase\\nas he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the arm,\\nand lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to the\\nground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can withstand,\\ncame over his eyes. \\n\\nThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of\\nTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or\\nthe Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that\\nhas burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful\\nvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven,\\nbut in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste\\nthat many a strong man hand has reclaimed- even so were the dense\\nphalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and\\nmany though they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.\\n\\nNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving\\nthe Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front\\npart of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through\\nthe metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with\\nblood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, \"Knights Trojans,\\ncome on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold\\nout much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from\\nLycia hither.\" \\n\\nThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew\\nand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.\\n\"Dear son of Capaneus,\" said he, \"come down from your chariot, and\\ndraw the arrow out of my shoulder.\" \\n\\nSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound,\\nwhereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been\\nmade in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, \"Hear me, daughter\\nof aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well\\nand stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant\\nme to come within a spear\\'s throw of that man and kill him. He has\\nbeen too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that\\nI shall not see the light of the sun much longer.\" \\n\\nThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple\\nand quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him\\nand said, \"Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I\\nhave set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus.\\nMoreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know\\ngods and men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers\\nyou battle, do not fight him; but should Jove\\'s daughter Venus come,\\nstrike her with your spear and wound her.\" \\n\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again\\ntook his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce\\neven than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain\\nshepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the\\nwall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused\\nthe brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter\\nunder cover of the buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being\\ndeserted, are smothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the\\nangry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed\\ngo furiously about among the Trojans. \\n\\nHe killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with a thrust\\nof his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with a\\nsword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his\\nneck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas\\nand Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never\\ncame back for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed\\nmade an end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the\\ntwo sons of Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now\\nworn out with age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions.\\nBut Diomed took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly,\\nfor he nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen\\ndivided his wealth among themselves. \\n\\nThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they\\nwere both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on\\nthe neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice.\\nFor all their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot\\nand stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses\\nto his comrades to take them back to the ships. \\n\\nWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through\\nthe fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus.\\nWhen he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, \"Pandarus, where\\nis now your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer,\\nin respect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in\\nLycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an\\narrow at this fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done\\nsuch deadly work among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man-\\nunless indeed he is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their\\nsacrifices, and and has set his hand against them in his displeasure.\"\\n\\nAnd the son of Lycaon answered, \"Aeneas, I take him for none other\\nthan the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his\\nhelmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but\\nif he is the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without\\nheaven\\'s help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud\\nof darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I\\nhave taken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my\\narrow went through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure\\nI should send him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I\\nhave not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover\\nI have neither horse nor chariot. In my father\\'s stables there are\\neleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with\\ncloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of\\nhorses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again\\nand again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take\\nchariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle,\\nbut I would not listen to him; it would have been much better if I\\nhad done so, but I was thinking about the horses, which had been used\\nto eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a great gathering\\nof men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot\\nto Ilius armed only with my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of\\nno use, for I have already hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus\\nand of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, I have only\\nmade them still more furious. I did ill to take my bow down from its\\npeg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius in Hector\\'s service,\\nand if ever I get home again to set eyes on my native place, my wife,\\nand the greatness of my house, may some one cut my head off then and\\nthere if I do not break the bow and set it on a hot fire- such pranks\\nas it plays me.\" \\n\\nAeneas answered, \"Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go\\nagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial\\nof arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros\\ncan speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight.\\nIf Jove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry\\nus safely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins\\nwhile I stand upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man\\'s\\nonset while I look after the horses.\" \\n\\n\"Aeneas.\" replied the son of Lycaon, \"take the reins and drive; if\\nwe have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better\\nfor their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they\\nexpect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the\\nfight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses.\\nTherefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my\\nspear.\" \\n\\nThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son\\nof Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to\\nDiomed, \"Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two\\nheroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful\\narcher, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is Anchises,\\nwhile his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us retreat. Do\\nnot, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get killed.\"\\n\\nDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: \"Talk not of flight, for\\nI shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight\\nnor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount,\\nbut will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid\\nof no man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall\\nnot take both back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your\\nheart- if Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both,\\nstay your horses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot;\\nthen be sure you spring Aeneas\\' horses and drive them from the Trojan\\nto the Achaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to\\nTros in payment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live\\nand move under the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his\\nmares to them without Laomedon\\'s knowledge, and they bore him six\\nfoals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the other two to\\nAeneas. We shall win great glory if we can take them.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up\\nto them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. \"Great and mighty son,\"\\nsaid he, \"of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will\\nnow try with my spear.\" \\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck\\nthe shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed\\non till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted\\nout and said, \"You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand\\nout for long, and the glory of the fight is mine.\" \\n\\nBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, \"You have missed, not hit,\\nand before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you\\nshall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.\" \\n\\nWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus\\'s\\nnose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the\\nbronze point cut through the root of his to tongue, coming out under\\nhis chin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he\\nfell heavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and\\nhe was reft of life and strength. \\n\\nAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing\\nlest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion\\nin the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before him and\\na cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should\\ndare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so\\nhuge and great that as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless\\nhe bore it aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas\\non the groin where the hip turns in the joint that is called the \"cup-bone.\"\\nThe stone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its\\njagged edges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees,\\nand propped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness\\nof night fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have\\nperished then and there, had not his mother, Jove\\'s daughter Venus,\\nwho had conceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been\\nquick to mark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her\\ndear son. She protected him by covering him with a fold of her own\\nfair garment, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast\\nand kill him. \\n\\nThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son\\nof Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given\\nhim. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding\\nthe reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas\\'s\\nhorses and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he\\nhad so done he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom\\nhe valued above all others as the one who was most like-minded with\\nhimself, to take them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot,\\nseized the reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of\\nTydeus. \\n\\nNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear\\nin hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses\\nthat can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster\\nof cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he\\nflew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand.\\nThe point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven\\nfor her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her\\nhand, so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins\\nof the blessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do\\nnot eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours,\\nand are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but\\nPhoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness,\\nlest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him;\\nand Diomed shouted out as he left her, \"Daughter of Jove, leave war\\nand battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women?\\nIf you meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder\\nat the very name of war.\" \\n\\nThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the\\nwind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all\\nbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,\\nwith his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon\\nshe fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her\\nhave his horses. \"Dear brother,\" she cried, \"save me, and give me\\nyour horses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly\\nwounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with\\nfather Jove.\" \\n\\nThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She mounted\\nthe chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her and\\ntook the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew\\nforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where\\nthe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them\\nfrom the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus\\nflung herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms\\nabout her and caressed her, saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings\\nhas been treating you in this way, as though you had been doing something\\nwrong in the face of day?\" \\n\\nAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, \"Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus,\\nwounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best\\nof all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between\\nTrojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with\\nthe immortals.\" \\n\\n\"Bear it, my child,\" replied Dione, \"and make the best of it. We dwellers\\nin Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and we lay\\nmuch suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and Ephialtes,\\nchildren of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay thirteen\\nmonths imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then perished\\nhad not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told Mercury,\\nwho stole him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by the severity\\nof his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son of Amphitryon\\nwounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed arrow, and nothing\\ncould assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same man,\\nthe son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an arrow even at the gates\\nof hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove\\non great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the arrow in his brawny\\nshoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon healed him by spreading\\nsoothing herbs on the wound, for Hades was not of mortal mould. Daring,\\nhead-strong, evildoer who recked not of his sin in shooting the gods\\nthat dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus\\non against yourself, fool that he is for not reflecting that no man\\nwho fights with gods will live long or hear his children prattling\\nabout his knees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of\\nTydeus see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger\\nthan you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus,\\nrouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her wedded\\nlord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with\\nboth hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But\\nMinerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their\\nmocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak. \"Father Jove,\" said\\nshe, \"do not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been\\npersuading some one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of\\nwhom she is so very fond, and while caressing one or other of them\\nshe must have torn her delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman\\'s\\nbrooch.\" \\n\\nThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his side.\\n\"My child,\" said he, \"it has not been given you to be a warrior. Attend,\\nhenceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and leave all\\nthis fighting to Mars and to Minerva.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he knew\\nhim to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the\\nmighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his\\narmour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him,\\nand thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming\\non for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to\\nhim with an awful voice and said, \"Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw\\noff; think not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the\\nearth cannot hold their own with the immortals.\" \\n\\nThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger\\nof the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him\\nin sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty\\nsanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold,\\nwhile Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness\\nof Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans\\nhacked at the bucklers about one another\\'s breasts, hewing each other\\'s\\nround shields and light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo\\nsaid to Mars, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities,\\ncan you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight\\neven with father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went\\nup to the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and\\nafterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god.\"\\n\\nHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars\\nwent about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the\\nlikeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. \"Sons of Priam,\"\\nsaid he, \"how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by\\nthe Achaeans? Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas\\nthe son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour\\nas Hector himself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from\\nthe stress of the fight.\" \\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon\\nrebuked Hector very sternly. \"Hector,\" said he, \"where is your prowess\\nnow? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies\\nyou could hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law.\\nI see not one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it\\nis we, your allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come\\nfrom afar, even from Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where\\nI have left my wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever\\nis needy; nevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground\\nagainst any who would fight me though I have nothing here for the\\nAchaeans to plunder, while you look on, without even bidding your\\nmen stand firm in defence of their wives. See that you fall not into\\nthe hands of your foes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they\\nsack your fair city forthwith. Keep this before your mind night and\\nday, and beseech the captains of your allies to hold on without flinching,\\nand thus put away their reproaches from you.\" \\n\\nSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang from\\nhis chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host\\nbrandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising\\nthe terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the\\nAchaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven\\nback. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor,\\nwhen men are winnowing- while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to\\nsift the chaff from the grain, and the chaff- heaps grow whiter and\\nwhiter- even so did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses\\'\\nhoofs raised to the firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them\\nback to battle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce\\nMars, to help the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and\\nwent about everywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told\\nhim that when he saw Pallas, Minerva leave the fray he was to put\\ncourage into the hearts of the Trojans- for it was she who was helping\\nthe Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary,\\nand filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his place among\\nhis comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of\\na good courage; but they could not ask him how it had all happened,\\nfor they were too busy with the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife,\\nwho raged insatiably in their midst. \\n\\nThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless\\nof the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds\\nwhich the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there\\nis no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds\\nwhose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions- even so\\ndid the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The\\nson of Atreus went about among them and exhorted them. \"My friends,\"\\nsaid he, \"quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one\\nanother\\'s eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour\\nmore often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life\\nnor name.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the\\nfront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the\\nTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was\\never quick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King\\nAgamemnon struck his shield and went right through it, for the shield\\nstayed it not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his\\nbelly, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to\\nthe ground. \\n\\nThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and Orsilochus.\\nTheir father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of Phere\\nand was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream flows\\nthrough the land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who ruled\\nover much people and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat\\ntwin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of\\nwar. These, when they grew up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet\\nin the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they\\nboth of them fell. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths\\nof some mountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep\\nand cattle till they get killed by the hand of man, so were these\\ntwo vanquished by Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the ground.\\n\\nBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the\\nfront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars\\negged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas;\\nbut Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing\\nthat the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour to\\nnothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands\\nand spears against one another eager to do battle, Antilochus placed\\nhimself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though he was, drew\\nback on seeing the two heroes side by side in front of him, so they\\ndrew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans\\nand committed the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades.\\nThey then turned back and fought in the front ranks. \\n\\nThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian warriors.\\nMenelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on his chariot,\\nwhile Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the son of Atymnius,\\nwho was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with a stone upon\\nthe elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell from his\\nhands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck him\\non the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the\\nchariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and\\nshoulders buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soil\\ntill his horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus\\nlashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.\\n\\nBut Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry\\nrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.\\nMars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil\\nof battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now\\nin front of Hector and now behind him. \\n\\nDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide\\nplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river\\nrolling swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts\\nback in fear- even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said\\nto his men, \"My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the\\nspear so well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now\\nMars is with him in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore\\ntowards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight\\nwith gods.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,\\nboth in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in\\nwar. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close\\nup and hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man\\nof great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land,\\nbut his lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons.\\nAjax struck him in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his\\nbelly, and he fell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him\\nto strip him of his armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him,\\nmany of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel upon the body\\nand drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him\\nthat he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The\\nTrojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with\\ntheir spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant\\nthough he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.\\n\\nThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong\\nhand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both\\nbrave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and\\ngrandson of great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke\\nfirst. \"Sarpedon,\" said he, \"councillor of the Lycians, why should\\nyou come skulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call\\nyou son of aegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were\\nof old his children. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted\\nfather, who came here for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had\\nsix ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius\\nand made a wilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your\\npeople are falling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming\\nfrom Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates\\nof Hades vanquished by my hand.\" \\n\\nAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, \"Tlepolemus, your\\nfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon\\'s folly in refusing payment\\nto one who had served him well. He would not give your father the\\nhorses which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you shall\\nmeet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your\\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\" \\n\\nThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw\\nat the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his\\nthroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell\\nupon his eyes. Tlepolemus\\'s spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh\\nwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone,\\nbut his father as yet warded off destruction from him. \\n\\nHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the\\nweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in\\nsuch haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing\\nthe spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile\\nthe Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was\\nmoved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted\\nwhether to pursue the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian\\nrank and file; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the\\nson of Jove; Minerva, therefore, turned him against the main body\\nof the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus,\\nHalius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not\\ngreat Hector marked him, and sped to the front of the fight clad in\\nhis suit of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad\\nwhen he saw him coming, and besought him, saying, \"Son of Priam, let\\nme not he here to fall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and\\nsince I may not return home to gladden the hearts of my wife and of\\nmy infant son, let me die within the walls of your city.\"\\n\\nHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon\\nthe Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon\\naway and laid him beneath Jove\\'s spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his\\nfriend and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted\\nand a mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again,\\nfor the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new\\nlife, and brought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Mars\\nand Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars\\nwas with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned\\ntowards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by\\nMars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned\\ncharioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son\\nof Oenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed\\nof great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians\\nwho lived near him, owners of a fertile country. \\n\\nNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said to\\nMinerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the promise\\nwe made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked the\\ncity of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars rage thus furiously.\\nLet us go into the fray at once.\" \\n\\nMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter\\nof great Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe\\nwith all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were\\non either side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were\\nof gold, imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze,\\nwondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round\\nthe axle upon either side. The car itself was made with plaited bands\\nof gold and silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round\\nit. From the body of the car there went a pole of silver, on to the\\nend of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that\\nwere to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno put her steeds\\nunder the yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry. \\n\\nMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with\\nher own hands, on to her father\\'s threshold, and donned the shirt\\nof Jove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis\\nabout. her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and\\non it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold;\\nmoreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim and\\nawful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set\\nher helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both in\\nfront and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; then\\nshe stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stout\\nand sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes who\\nhave displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven\\nbellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates over which the\\nflours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open\\nthe dense cloud that hides them, or to close it. Through these the\\ngoddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found the son of Saturn\\nsitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed\\nher horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn, lord of all. \"Father\\nJove,\" said she, \"are you not angry with Mars for these high doings?\\nhow great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has destroyed to my\\ngreat grief, and without either right or reason, while the Cyprian\\nand Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease and setting this unrighteous\\nmadman on to do further mischief. I hope, Father Jove, that you will\\nnot be angry if I hit Mars hard, and chase him out of the battle.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more\\noften than any one else does.\" \\n\\nJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward\\nnothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see\\nwhen he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the\\nloud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they\\nreached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois and\\nScamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot.\\nShe hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up\\nfor them to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves\\nin their eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part\\nwhere the bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed,\\nfighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance,\\nthere Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced\\nStentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together. \"Argives,\"\\nshe cried; \"shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only;\\nas long as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear was so deadly that\\nthe Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates,\\nbut now they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships.\"\\n\\nWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva\\nsprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his chariot\\nand horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For the\\nsweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield irritated\\nthe hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up the strap\\nto wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his\\nhorses and said, \"The son of Tydeus is not such another as his father.\\nTydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into\\nthe fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went all unattended\\nas envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade him feast\\nin their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit which was\\never present with him, he challenged the youth of the Cadmeans, and\\nat once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily did I help\\nhim. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be instant in\\nfighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or you are afraid\\nand out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no true son\\nof Tydeus the son of Oeneus.\" \\n\\nDiomed answered, \"I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove,\\nand will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart,\\nnor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your own instructions;\\nyou told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if Jove\\'s daughter\\nVenus came into battle I was to wound her with my spear. Therefore\\nI am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather in this place,\\nfor I know that Mars is now lording it in the field.\" \\n\\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus,\" replied Minerva, \"man after my own heart,\\nfear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend\\nyou. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear\\nnot this raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then\\non the other. But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying\\nhe would help the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he\\nis with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.\" \\n\\nWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot\\non to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the\\ngoddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed.\\nThe oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess\\nand the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight\\nat Mars. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius\\nand bravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his\\narmour, and Minerva donned the helmet of Hades, that he might not\\nsee her; when, therefore, he saw Diomed, he made straight for him\\nand let Periphas lie where he had fallen. As soon as they were at\\nclose quarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and\\nyoke, thinking to take Diomed\\'s life, but Minerva caught the spear\\nin her hand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then\\nthrew, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars\\'s stomach\\nwhere his under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing\\nhis fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as\\nloudly as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the\\nAchaeans and Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry\\nhe raised. \\n\\nAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even\\nso did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens.\\nWith all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great\\npain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal\\nblood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying,\\n\"Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are continually\\nsuffering in the most cruel manner at one another\\'s hands while helping\\nmortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad\\ntermagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of some\\nkind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you neither\\nscold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature\\nis your daughter. See how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent\\nhis rage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian and\\nwounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me\\ntoo as though he were a god. Had I not run for it I must either have\\nlain there for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpes, or\\nhave been eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left\\nin me.\" \\n\\nJove looked angrily at him and said, \"Do not come whining here, Sir\\nFacing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for\\nyou are ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable\\nand stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage\\nher, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I\\ncannot let you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own off-spring,\\nand it was by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you\\nhad been the son of any other god, you are so destructive that by\\nthis time you should have been lying lower than the Titans.\"\\n\\nHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing herbs\\nupon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As the\\njuice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though\\nit is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then\\nHebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his\\nseat by his father Jove all glorious to behold. \\n\\nBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put\\na stop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house\\nof Jove. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK VI\\n\\nThe fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it\\nwould, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain\\nas they aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the\\nstreams of Simois and Xanthus. \\n\\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke\\na phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades\\nby killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians,\\nbeing both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting\\npeak of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead\\ninto the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes. \\n\\nThen Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived\\nin the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had\\na house by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit\\nnot one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomed\\nkilled both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his charioteer-\\nso the pair passed beneath the earth. \\n\\nEuryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of\\nAesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to noble\\nBucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard.\\nWhile tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and she conceived\\ntwin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and he stripped the\\narmour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killed Astyalus, Ulysses\\nPidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fell by the spear\\nof Nestor\\'s son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men, killed Elatus\\nwho dwelt in Pedasus by the banks of the river Satnioeis. Leitus killed\\nPhylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus slew Melanthus.\\n\\nThen Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his horses\\nran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the plain,\\nand broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the city along\\nwith the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out, and fell\\nin the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot; Menelaus\\ncame up to him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him by the knees\\nbegging for his life. \"Take me alive,\" he cried, \"son of Atreus, and\\nyou shall have a full ransom for me: my father is rich and has much\\ntreasure of gold, bronze, and wrought iron laid by in his house. From\\nthis store he will give you a large ransom should he hear of my being\\nalive and at the ships of the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nThus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to\\na squire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon came\\nrunning up to him and rebuked him. \"My good Menelaus,\" said he, \"this\\nis no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so well\\nat the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of them-\\nnot even the child unborn and in its mother\\'s womb; let not a man\\nof them be left alive, but let all in Ilius perish, unheeded and forgotten.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his words\\nwere just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him, whereon\\nKing Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then the son\\nof Atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his spear from\\nthe body. \\n\\nMeanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, \"My friends, Danaan\\nwarriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead,\\nand bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we\\ncan; the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them\\nlater at your leisure.\" \\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the\\nTrojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had not\\nPriam\\'s son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas,\\n\"Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the Trojans and Lycians,\\nfor you are foremost at all times, alike in fight and counsel; hold\\nyour ground here, and go about among the host to rally them in front\\nof the gates, or they will fling themselves into the arms of their\\nwives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you have put heart\\ninto all our companies, we will stand firm here and fight the Danaans\\nhowever hard they press us, for there is nothing else to be done.\\nMeanwhile do you, Hector, go to the city and tell our mother what\\nis happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the temple of\\nMinerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and open the doors\\nof the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva, let her\\nlay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house- the one she sets\\nmost store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelve yearling\\nheifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of the goddess,\\nif she will take pity on the town, with the wives and little ones\\nof the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from falling on the goodly\\ncity of Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men\\'s souls with\\npanic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not fear even their\\ngreat champion Achilles, son of a goddess though he be, as we do this\\nman: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with\\nhim in prowess\" \\n\\nHector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot, and\\nwent about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears, urging\\nthe men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle. Thereon\\nthey rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave ground and ceased\\ntheir murderous onset, for they deemed that some one of the immortals\\nhad come down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, so strangely\\nhad they rallied. And Hector shouted to the Trojans, \"Trojans and\\nallies, be men, my friends, and fight with might and main, while I\\ngo to Ilius and tell the old men of our council and our wives to pray\\nto the gods and vow hecatombs in their honour.\" \\n\\nWith this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went round\\nhis shield beat against his neck and his ancles. \\n\\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into the\\nopen space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When they\\nwere close up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first\\nto speak. \"Who, my good sir,\" said he, \"who are you among men? I have\\nnever seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond all\\nothers if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face\\nmy might. If, however, you are one of the immortals and have come\\ndown from heaven, I will not fight you; for even valiant Lycurgus,\\nson of Dryas, did not live long when he took to fighting with the\\ngods. He it was that drove the nursing women who were in charge of\\nfrenzied Bacchus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi\\non the ground as murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus\\nhimself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him\\nto her bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which\\nthe man reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry\\nwith Lycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he live\\nmuch longer after he had become hateful to the immortals. Therefore\\nI will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them that\\neat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your doom.\"\\n\\nAnd the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me of\\nmy lineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees.\\nThose of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring returns\\nthe forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the generations\\nof mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away. If, then,\\nyou would learn my descent, it is one that is well known to many.\\nThere is a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land of horses, called\\nEphyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind.\\nHe was the son of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus, who was father\\nto Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing comeliness\\nand beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and being stronger than\\nhe, drove him from the land of the Argives, over which Jove had made\\nhim ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted after him, and would\\nhave had him lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honourable\\nman and would not, so she told lies about him to Proteus. \\'Proetus,\\'\\nsaid she, \\'kill Bellerophon or die, for he would have had converse\\nwith me against my will.\\' The king was angered, but shrank from killing\\nBellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia with lying letters of introduction,\\nwritten on a folded tablet, and containing much ill against the bearer.\\nHe bade Bellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the\\nend that he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia,\\nand the gods convoyed him safely. \\n\\n\"When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king received\\nhim with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nine heifers\\nin his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the tenth\\nday, he questioned him and desired to see the letter from his son-in-law\\nProetus. When he had received the wicked letter he first commanded\\nBellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera, who was not\\na human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of a lion and the\\ntail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, and she breathed\\nforth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he was guided\\nby signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famed Solymi, and this,\\nhe said, was the hardest of all his battles. Thirdly, he killed the\\nAmazons, women who were the peers of men, and as he was returning\\nthence the king devised yet another plan for his destruction; he picked\\nthe bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed them in ambuscade, but\\nnot a man ever came back, for Bellerophon killed every one of them.\\nThen the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of a god,\\nso he kept him in Lycia, gave him his daughter in marriage, and made\\nhim of equal honour in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave\\nhim a piece of land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards\\nand tilled fields, to have and to hold. \\n\\n\"The king\\'s daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander, Hippolochus,\\nand Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay with Laodameia, and\\nshe bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon came to be hated\\nby all the gods, he wandered all desolate and dismayed upon the Alean\\nplain, gnawing at his own heart, and shunning the path of man. Mars,\\ninsatiate of battle, killed his son Isander while he was fighting\\nthe Solymi; his daughter was killed by Diana of the golden reins,\\nfor she was angered with her; but Hippolochus was father to myself,\\nand when he sent me to Troy he urged me again and again to fight ever\\namong the foremost and outvie my peers, so as not to shame the blood\\nof my fathers who were the noblest in Ephyra and in all Lycia. This,\\nthen, is the descent I claim.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted his\\nspear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. \"Then,\"\\nhe said, you are an old friend of my father\\'s house. Great Oeneus\\nonce entertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchanged\\npresents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon a double\\ncup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do not remember\\nTydeus, for he was taken from us while I was yet a child, when the\\narmy of the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes. Henceforth,\\nhowever, I must be your host in middle Argos, and you mine in Lycia,\\nif I should ever go there; let us avoid one another\\'s spears even\\nduring a general engagement; there are many noble Trojans and allies\\nwhom I can kill, if I overtake them and heaven delivers them into\\nmy hand; so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whose lives\\nyou may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour, that\\nall present may know of the old ties that subsist between us.\"\\n\\nWith these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one another\\'s\\nhands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn made Glaucus\\ntake leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour for bronze,\\nthe worth of a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.\\n\\nNow when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wives\\nand daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to ask after\\ntheir sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set about\\npraying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.\\n\\nPresently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned with\\ncolonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers- all\\nof hewn stone- built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept,\\neach with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side the courtyard,\\nthere were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for Priam\\'s daughters,\\nbuilt near one another, where his sons-in-law slept with their wives.\\nWhen Hector got there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodice\\nthe fairest of her daughters. She took his hand within her own and\\nsaid, \"My son, why have you left the battle to come hither? Are the\\nAchaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about the city that you\\nhave thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jove from the citadel?\\nWait till I can bring you wine that you may make offering to Jove\\nand to the other immortals, and may then drink and be refreshed. Wine\\ngives a man fresh strength when he is wearied, as you now are with\\nfighting on behalf of your kinsmen.\" \\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unman\\nme and I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering to Jove\\nwith unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and filth may\\nnot pray to the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, and go with\\nofferings to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there, upon\\nthe knees of Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in\\nyour house- the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to sacrifice\\ntwelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the\\ntemple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, with the\\nwives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from\\noff the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights with fury, and fills men\\'s\\nsouls with panic. Go, then, to the temple of Minerva, while I seek\\nParis and exhort him, if he will hear my words. Would that the earth\\nmight open her jaws and swallow him, for Jove bred him to be the bane\\nof the Trojans, and of Priam and Priam\\'s sons. Could I but see him\\ngo down into the house of Hades, my heart would forget its heaviness.\"\\n\\nHis mother went into the house and called her waiting-women who gathered\\nthe matrons throughout the city. She then went down into her fragrant\\nstore-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, the work of Sidonian\\nwomen, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidon when he sailed\\nthe seas upon that voyage during which he carried off Helen. Hecuba\\ntook out the largest robe, and the one that was most beautifully enriched\\nwith embroidery, as an offering to Minerva: it glittered like a star,\\nand lay at the very bottom of the chest. With this she went on her\\nway and many matrons with her. \\n\\nWhen they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter of\\nCisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojans had\\nmade her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their hands to\\nthe goddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay it upon\\nthe knees of Minerva, praying the while to the daughter of great Jove.\\n\"Holy Minerva,\" she cried, \"protectress of our city, mighty goddess,\\nbreak the spear of Diomed and lay him low before the Scaean gates.\\nDo this, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers that have never yet\\nknown the goad, in your temple, if you will have pity upon the town,\\nwith the wives and little ones If the Trojans.\" Thus she prayed, but\\nPallas Minerva granted not her prayer. \\n\\nWhile they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hector\\nwent to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built for him by\\nthe foremost builders in the land. They had built him his house, storehouse,\\nand courtyard near those of Priam and Hector on the acropolis. Here\\nHector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in his hand; the bronze\\npoint gleamed in front of him, and was fastened to the shaft of the\\nspear by a ring of gold. He found Alexandrus within the house, busied\\nabout his armour, his shield and cuirass, and handling his curved\\nbow; there, too, sat Argive Helen with her women, setting them their\\nseveral tasks; and as Hector saw him he rebuked him with words of\\nscorn. \"Sir,\" said he, \"you do ill to nurse this rancour; the people\\nperish fighting round this our town; you would yourself chide one\\nwhom you saw shirking his part in the combat. Up then, or ere long\\nthe city will be in a blaze.\" \\n\\nAnd Alexandrus answered, \"Hector, your rebuke is just; listen therefore,\\nand believe me when I tell you that I am not here so much through\\nrancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire to indulge\\nmy grief. My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, and I hold\\nit better that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait, then,\\nwhile I put on my armour, or go first and I will follow. I shall be\\nsure to overtake you.\" \\n\\nHector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. \"Brother,\" said\\nshe, \"to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind had caught\\nme up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had borne me to some\\nmountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that should have swept\\nme away ere this mischief had come about. But, since the gods have\\ndevised these evils, would, at any rate, that I had been wife to a\\nbetter man- to one who could smart under dishonour and men\\'s evil\\nspeeches. This fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nor never\\nwill be, and he will surely reap what he has sown. Still, brother,\\ncome in and rest upon this seat, for it is you who bear the brunt\\nof that toil that has been caused by my hateful self and by the sin\\nof Alexandrus- both of whom Jove has doomed to be a theme of song\\namong those that shall be born hereafter.\" \\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all the goodwill\\nyou bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the Trojans, who\\nmiss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge your husband, and\\nof his own self also let him make haste to overtake me before I am\\nout of the city. I must go home to see my household, my wife and my\\nlittle son, for I know not whether I shall ever again return to them,\\nor whether the gods will cause me to fill by the hands of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThen Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did not\\nfind Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of\\nher maids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within,\\nhe stood on the threshold of the women\\'s rooms and said, \"Women, tell\\nme, and tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the house?\\nWas it to my sisters, or to my brothers\\' wives? or is she at the temple\\nof Minerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?\"\\n\\nHis good housekeeper answered, \"Hector, since you bid me tell you\\ntruly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers\\' wives,\\nnor yet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiating\\nthe awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she had\\nheard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeans were\\nin great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the nurse\\nwent with her carrying the child.\" \\n\\nHector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went\\ndown the streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gone\\nthrough the city and had reached the Scaean gates through which he\\nwould go out on to the plain, his wife came running towards him, Andromache,\\ndaughter of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe under the wooded slopes\\nof Mt. Placus, and was king of the Cilicians. His daughter had married\\nHector, and now came to meet him with a nurse who carried his little\\nchild in her bosom- a mere babe. Hector\\'s darling son, and lovely\\nas a star. Hector had named him Scamandrius, but the people called\\nhim Astyanax, for his father stood alone as chief guardian of Ilius.\\nHector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak, and\\nAndromache stood by him weeping and taking his hand in her own. \"Dear\\nhusband,\" said she, \"your valour will bring you to destruction; think\\non your infant son, and on my hapless self who ere long shall be your\\nwidow- for the Achaeans will set upon you in a body and kill you.\\nIt would be better for me, should I lose you, to lie dead and buried,\\nfor I shall have nothing left to comfort me when you are gone, save\\nonly sorrow. I have neither father nor mother now. Achilles slew my\\nfather when he sacked Thebe the goodly city of the Cilicians. He slew\\nhim, but did not for very shame despoil him; when he had burned him\\nin his wondrous armour, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the\\nmountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, planted a grove\\nof elms about his tomb. I had seven brothers in my father\\'s house,\\nbut on the same day they all went within the house of Hades. Achilles\\nkilled them as they were with their sheep and cattle. My mother- her\\nwho had been queen of all the land under Mt. Placus- he brought hither\\nwith the spoil, and freed her for a great sum, but the archer- queen\\nDiana took her in the house of your father. Nay- Hector- you who to\\nme are father, mother, brother, and dear husband- have mercy upon\\nme; stay here upon this wall; make not your child fatherless, and\\nyour wife a widow; as for the host, place them near the fig-tree,\\nwhere the city can be best scaled, and the wall is weakest. Thrice\\nhave the bravest of them come thither and assailed it, under the two\\nAjaxes, Idomeneus, the sons of Atreus, and the brave son of Tydeus,\\neither of their own bidding, or because some soothsayer had told them.\"\\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Wife, I too have thought upon all this, but\\nwith what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if I\\nshirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save\\nto fight bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown\\nalike for my father and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely\\ncome when mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam\\'s people,\\nbut I grieve for none of these- not even for Hecuba, nor King Priam,\\nnor for my brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust before\\ntheir foes- for none of these do I grieve as for yourself when the\\nday shall come on which some one of the Achaeans shall rob you for\\never of your freedom, and bear you weeping away. It may be that you\\nwill have to ply the loom in Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or\\nto fetch water from the springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutally\\nby some cruel task-master; then will one say who sees you weeping,\\n\\'She was wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojans during\\nthe war before Ilius.\\' On this your tears will break forth anew for\\nhim who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May I lie\\ndead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hear your\\ncry as they carry you into bondage.\" \\n\\nHe stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and nestled\\nin his nurse\\'s bosom, scared at the sight of his father\\'s armour,\\nand at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his helmet.\\nHis father and mother laughed to see him, but Hector took the helmet\\nfrom his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground. Then he took\\nhis darling child, kissed him, and dandled him in his arms, praying\\nover him the while to Jove and to all the gods. \"Jove,\" he cried,\\n\"grant that this my child may be even as myself, chief among the Trojans;\\nlet him be not less excellent in strength, and let him rule Ilius\\nwith his might. Then may one say of him as he comes from battle, \\'The\\nson is far better than the father.\\' May he bring back the blood-stained\\nspoils of him whom he has laid low, and let his mother\\'s heart be\\nglad.\\'\" \\n\\nWith this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who took\\nhim to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As her husband\\nwatched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed her fondly,\\nsaying, \"My own wife, do not take these things too bitterly to heart.\\nNo one can hurry me down to Hades before my time, but if a man\\'s hour\\nis come, be he brave or be he coward, there is no escape for him when\\nhe has once been born. Go, then, within the house, and busy yourself\\nwith your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering\\nof your servants; for war is man\\'s matter, and mine above all others\\nof them that have been born in Ilius.\" \\n\\nHe took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back\\nagain to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towards\\nhim. When she reached her home she found her maidens within, and bade\\nthem all join in her lament; so they mourned Hector in his own house\\nthough he was yet alive, for they deemed that they should never see\\nhim return safe from battle, and from the furious hands of the Achaeans.\\n\\nParis did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly armour\\noverlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast as his feet\\ncould take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and gallops\\ngloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to bathe in\\nthe fair-flowing river- he holds his head high, and his mane streams\\nupon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies like the\\nwind to the haunts and feeding ground of the mares- even so went forth\\nParis from high Pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in his armour, and\\nhe laughed aloud as he sped swiftly on his way. Forthwith he came\\nupon his brother Hector, who was then turning away from the place\\nwhere he had held converse with his wife, and he was himself the first\\nto speak. \"Sir,\" said he, \"I fear that I have kept you waiting when\\nyou are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you bade me.\"\\n\\n\"My good brother,\" answered Hector, you fight bravely, and no man\\nwith any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But you\\nare careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear\\nthe ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have suffered much\\non your account. Let us be going, and we will make things right hereafter,\\nshould Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of our deliverance before\\never-living gods of heaven in our own homes, when we have chased the\\nAchaeans from Troy.\" \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK VII\\n\\nWith these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother\\nAlexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends\\na breeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have\\nlaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so welcome\\nwas the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans. \\n\\nThereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he lived\\nin Ame, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of Phylomedusa.\\nHector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in\\nthe neck under the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaucus, moreover, son\\nof Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight\\nsmote Iphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as he was springing\\non to his chariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell to earth from\\nthe car, and there was no life left in him. \\n\\nWhen, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the Argives,\\nshe darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, and Apollo,\\nwho was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he wanted\\nthe Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and King\\nApollo son of Jove was first to speak. \"What would you have said he,\\n\"daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hither\\nfrom Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline\\nthe scales of victory in favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade you-\\nfor it will be better thus- stay the combat for to-day, but let them\\nrenew the fight hereafter till they compass the doom of Ilius, since\\nyou goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva answered, \"So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind that\\nI came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me, then,\\nhow do you propose to end this present fighting?\" \\n\\nApollo, son of Jove, replied, \"Let us incite great Hector to challenge\\nsome one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the Achaeans will\\nbe shamed into finding a man who will fight him.\" \\n\\nMinerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of\\nthe gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, \"Hector son of\\nPriam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then persuade\\nyou. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats,\\nand challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you in single\\ncombat. I have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour\\nof your doom is not yet come.\" \\n\\nHector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the Trojans,\\ngrasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and they all sat\\ndown. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But Minerva and\\nApollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father Jove\\'s high\\noak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together,\\nbristling with shield and helmet and spear. As when the rising west\\nwind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow dark beneath it,\\nso sat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector\\nspoke thus:- \\n\\n\"Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded;\\nJove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to nothing,\\nand foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers\\nof Troy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The princes of\\nthe Achaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him, then,\\nthat will fight me stand forward as your champion against Hector.\\nThus I say, and may Jove be witness between us. If your champion slay\\nme, let him strip me of my armour and take it to your ships, but let\\nhim send my body home that the Trojans and their wives may give me\\nmy dues of fire when I am dead. In like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe\\nme glory and I slay your champion, I will strip him of his armour\\nand take it to the city of Ilius, where I will hang it in the temple\\nof Apollo, but I will give up his body, that the Achaeans may bury\\nhim at their ships, and the build him a mound by the wide waters of\\nthe Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sails his ship over\\nthe sea, \\'This is the monument of one who died long since a champion\\nwho was slain by mighty Hector.\\' Thus will one say, and my fame shall\\nnot be lost.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline\\nthe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus rose\\nand rebuked them, for he was angry. \"Alas,\" he cried, \"vain braggarts,\\nwomen forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon\\nus if no man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned\\nevery man of you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious\\nin your places. I will myself go out against this man, but the upshot\\nof the fight will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your\\nlife would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for\\nhe was far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung\\nupon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand\\nand said, \"Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient\\nin spite of passion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger\\nthan yourself as Hector son of Priam, who is feared by many another\\nas well as you. Even Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are,\\nshrank from meeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the\\nAchaeans will send some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and\\nfond of battle though he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under\\nhim if he comes out alive from the hurly-burly of this fight.\"\\n\\nWith these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother, whereon\\nhis squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders. Then\\nNestor rose and spoke, \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"the Achaean land is\\nfallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and orator\\namong the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to question me\\nconcerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How would it not\\ngrieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before Hector? Many\\na time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave\\nhis body and go down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove,\\nMinerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the\\nPylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon\\nunder the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river\\nIardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their champion,\\nwith the armour of King Areithous upon his shoulders- Areithous whom\\nmen and women had surnamed \\'the Mace-man,\\' because he fought neither\\nwith bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron\\nmace. Lycurgus killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him\\nin a narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus\\nwas too quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell\\nto earth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which\\nMars had given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when\\nhe grew old and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire\\nEreuthalion, who in this same armour challenged the foremost men among\\nus. The others quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade me fight\\nhim though none other would venture; I was the youngest man of them\\nall; but when I fought him Minerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the\\nbiggest and strongest man that ever I killed, and covered much ground\\nas he lay sprawling upon the earth. Would that I were still young\\nand strong as I then was, for the son of Priam would then soon find\\none who would face him. But you, foremost among the whole host though\\nyou be, have none of you any stomach for fighting Hector.\"\\n\\nThus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started to\\ntheir feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him brave\\nDiomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in\\nvalour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his brother\\nin arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of Andraemon,\\nand Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor knight of Gerene again spoke, saying:\\n\"Cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. If he come alive\\nout of this fight he will have done good service alike to his own\\nsoul and to the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrown\\nit into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people lifted their\\nhands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into\\nthe vault of heaven, \"Father Jove, grant that the lot fall on Ajax,\\nor on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene himself.\"\\n\\nAs they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and\\nfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted- the lot of Ajax.\\nThe herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the\\nAchaeans, going from left to right; but they none of of them owned\\nit. When, however, in due course he reached the man who had written\\nupon it and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand,\\nand the herald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw him mark he knew it\\nand was glad; he threw it to the ground and said, \"My friends, the\\nlot is mine, and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put\\non my armour; meanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves\\nthat the Trojans may not hear you- or aloud if you will, for we fear\\nno man. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for\\nI was born and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.\"\\n\\nWith this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus\\nwould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, \"Father\\nJove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory\\nto Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector\\nalso and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess.\\n\\nThus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming bronze.\\nWhen he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Mars when\\nhe takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with one another-\\neven so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring forward with\\na grim smile on his face as he brandished his long spear and strode\\nonward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but the Trojans\\ntrembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector beat quickly,\\nbut he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks behind him,\\nfor he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his shield in\\nfront of him like a wall- a shield of bronze with seven folds of oxhide-\\nthe work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the best worker\\nin leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full-fed bulls,\\nand over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding this\\nshield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector, and\\nmenaced him saying, \"Hector, you shall now learn, man to man, what\\nkind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted\\nAchilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in\\nanger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of\\nus who are well able to face you; therefore begin the fight.\"\\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the host,\\ntreat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot fight.\\nI have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. I am\\nquick to turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this\\nI deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots and\\nhorsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Mars;\\nhowbeit I would not take such a man as you are off his guard- but\\nI will smite you openly if I can.\" \\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck\\nthe sevenfold shield in its outermost layer- the eighth, which was\\nof bronze- and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide\\nit stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield\\nof the son of Priam. The terrible spear went through his gleaming\\nshield, and pressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship;\\nit pierced the shirt against his side, but he swerved and thus saved\\nhis life. They then each of them drew out the spear from his shield,\\nand fell on one another like savage lions or wild boars of great strength\\nand endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax\\'s shield,\\nbut the bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned.\\nAjax then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear\\nwent through it and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack;\\nit gashed his neck and the blood came pouring from the wound, but\\neven so Hector did not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with his\\nbrawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the\\nplain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax on the boss that was\\nin its middle, so that the bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught\\nup a far larger stone, swung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious\\nforce. This millstone of a rock broke Hector\\'s shield inwards and\\nthrew him down on his back with the shield crushing him under it,\\nbut Apollo raised him at once. Thereon they would have hacked at one\\nanother in close combat with their swords, had not heralds, messengers\\nof gods and men, come forward, one from the Trojans and the other\\nfrom the Achaeans- Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable men;\\nthese parted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said,\\n\"My sons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both are\\ndear to Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the behests\\nof night may not be well gainsaid.\" \\n\\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \"Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was\\nhe that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will accept\\nhis saying.\" \\n\\nThen Hector said, \"Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and strength,\\nand judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all others of the\\nAchaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will fight\\nanew till heaven decide between us, and give victory to one or to\\nthe other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not\\nbe well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your\\nships, and more especially those of your own followers and clansmen,\\nwhile I, in the great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans\\nand their women, who vie with one another in their prayers on my behalf.\\nLet us, moreover, exchange presents that it may be said among the\\nAchaeans and Trojans, \\'They fought with might and main, but were reconciled\\nand parted in friendship.\\' \\n\\nOn this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and leathern\\nbaldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with purple. Thus\\nthey parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans, and the other\\nto that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their hero come\\nto them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty Ajax. They\\nled him, therefore, to the city as one that had been saved beyond\\ntheir hopes. On the other side the Achaeans brought Ajax elated with\\nvictory to Agamemnon. \\n\\nWhen they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon sacrificed\\nfor them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son of Saturn.\\nThey flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into joints;\\nthese they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them on the\\nspits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off. When\\nthey had done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it, and\\nevery man had his full and equal share, so that all were satisfied,\\nand King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin,\\nas a mark of special honour. As soon as they had had enough to cat\\nand drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak;\\nwith all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the Achaeans\\nare now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the Scamander,\\nand their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it will be well\\nwhen morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheel\\nour dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from the\\nships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades\\nhome to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow\\nthat shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let\\nus set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships,\\nand let it have well-made gates that there may be a way through them\\nfor our chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round\\nit to keep off both horse and foot, that the Trojan chieftains may\\nnot bear hard upon us.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the\\nTrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis\\nby the gates of King Priam\\'s palace; and wise Antenor spoke. \"Hear\\nme he said, \"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even\\nas I am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the\\nsons of Atreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn\\ncovenants, and shall not prosper till we have done as I say.\"\\n\\nHe then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to speak.\\n\"Antenor,\" said he, \"your words are not to my liking; you can find\\na better saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken\\nin good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason.\\nI will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that I will\\nnot give up the woman; but the wealth that I brought home with her\\nfrom Argos I will restore, and will add yet further of my own.\"\\n\\nOn this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race\\nof Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity\\nand goodwill addressed them thus: \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and\\nallies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now\\nas hitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful.\\nAt daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus\\nsons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel\\nhas come about; and let him also be instant with them that they now\\ncease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew,\\ntill heaven decide between us and give victory to one or to the other.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took supper\\nin their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his wa to the ships.\\nHe found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of\\nAgamemnon\\'s ship, and took his place in the midst of them. \"Son of\\nAtreus,\" he said, \"and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the\\nother noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus\\nthrough whom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find\\nit acceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships to Troy-\\nwould that he had sooner perished- he will restore, and will add yet\\nfurther of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife of Menelaus,\\nthough the Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me inquire further\\nif you will cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will\\nfight anew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one\\nor to the other.\" \\n\\nThey all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud war-cry\\nspoke, saying, \"Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet\\nHelen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at\\nhand.\" \\n\\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed\\nhad spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, \"Idaeus, you\\nhave heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as\\nconcerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are\\nonce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let\\nJove the mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, and\\nIdaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and Dardanians\\nwere gathered in council waiting his return; when he came, he stood\\nin their midst and delivered his message. As soon as they heard it\\nthey set about their twofold labour, some to gather the corpses, and\\nothers to bring in wood. The Argives on their part also hastened from\\ntheir ships, some to gather the corpses, and others to bring in wood.\\n\\nThe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into the\\nvault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when\\nthe two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they\\nwashed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and lifted\\nthem upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail aloud,\\nso they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having\\nburned them went back to the city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner\\nheaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned\\nthem went back to their ships. \\n\\nNow in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the\\nAchaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was\\nraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall\\nto shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that\\nthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and close outside\\nit they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with\\nstakes. \\n\\nThus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove\\nthe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune,\\nlord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, \"Father Jove, what mortal in\\nthe whole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you\\nnot how the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven\\na trench all round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The\\nThe fame of this wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will\\nno longer think anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself\\nbuilt with so much labour for Laomedon.\" \\n\\nJove was displeased and answered, \"What, O shaker of the earth, are\\nyou talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed\\nat what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself.\\nSurely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships, you can\\nshatter their wall and Ring it into the sea; you can cover the beach\\nwith sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be utterly\\neffaced.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was\\ncompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their\\nsupper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus\\nthe son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted\\nthem with ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to\\nthe sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the Achaeans\\nbought their wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides,\\nsome with whole heifers, and some again with captives. They spread\\na goodly banquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did\\nthe Trojans and their allies in the city. But all the time Jove boded\\nthem ill and roared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold\\nupon them, and they spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground,\\nnor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty\\nson of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed\\nthe boon of sleep. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK VIII\\n\\nNow when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse\\nlight over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmost\\ncrest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave\\near. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"gods and goddesses, that I may speak even\\nas I am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross\\nme, but obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an\\nend. If I see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans,\\nhe shall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to Olympus;\\nor I will hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into the deepest pit\\nunder the earth, where the gates are iron and the floor bronze, as\\nfar beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may\\nlearn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find out for\\nyourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it\\nall of you, gods and goddesses together- tug as you will, you will\\nnot drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to earth; but were\\nI to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and sea into\\nthe bargain, then would I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus\\nand leave you all dangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above\\nall others either of gods or men.\" \\n\\nThey were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had\\nspoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, \"Father, son of\\nSaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be gainsaid,\\nbut we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are perishing and\\ncoming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain\\nfrom actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to\\nthe Argives that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\"\\n\\nJove smiled at her and answered, \"Take heart, my child, Trito-born;\\nI am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you.\"\\n\\nWith this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes\\nof glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about the body,\\nseized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon he\\nlashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt\\nearth and starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained\\nIda, mother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove and\\nfragrant altar. There the father of gods and men stayed his horses,\\ntook them from the chariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he\\ntook his seat all glorious upon the topmost crests, looking down upon\\nthe city of Troy and the ships of the Achaeans. \\n\\nThe Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and afterwards\\nput on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewise armed\\nthemselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless\\neager perforce to do battle for their wives and children. All the\\ngates were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with\\nthe tramp as of a great multitude. \\n\\nWhen they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield,\\nand spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty was\\nthe din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another- death-\\ncry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red\\nwith blood. \\n\\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weapons\\nbeat against one another, and the people fell, but when the sun had\\nreached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden scales, and\\nput two fates of death within them, one for the Trojans and the other\\nfor the Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, and when he lifted\\nit up the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught scale of the\\nAchaeans settled down upon the ground, while that of the Trojans rose\\nheavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the glare\\nof his lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear\\nfell upon them and they were sore afraid. \\n\\nIdomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two Ajaxes,\\nservants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerene alone\\nstood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but one\\nof his horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had\\nhit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins\\nto grow away from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded\\nin his anguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw\\nothers into confusion. The old man instantly began cutting the traces\\nwith his sword, but Hector\\'s fleet horses bore down upon him through\\nthe rout with their bold charioteer, even Hector himself, and the\\nold man would have perished there and then had not Diomed been quick\\nto mark, and with a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.\\n\\n\"Ulysses,\" he cried, \"noble son of Laertes where are you flying to,\\nwith your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struck with\\na spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend Nestor\\nfrom this man\\'s furious onset.\" \\n\\nUlysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the Achaeans,\\nand the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the thick of the\\nfight took his stand before the horses of the son of Neleus. \"Sir,\"\\nsaid he, \"these young warriors are pressing you hard, your force is\\nspent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught, and your\\nhorses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what the horses\\nof Tros can do- how cleverly they can scud hither and thither over\\nthe plain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from the hero\\nAeneas. Let our squires attend to your own steeds, but let us drive\\nmine straight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn how furiously\\nI too can wield my spear.\" \\n\\nNestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the doughty\\nsquires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor\\'s horses,\\nwhile the two both mounted Diomed\\'s chariot. Nestor took the reins\\nin his hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up with\\nHector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was charging\\nfull speed towards them. He missed him, but struck his charioteer\\nand squire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple\\nwhile the reins were in his hands, so that he died there and then,\\nand the horses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. Hector\\nwas greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie\\nfor all his sorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor\\ndid his steeds have to go long without one, for he presently found\\nbrave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind\\nthe horses, giving the reins into his hand. \\n\\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have been\\npenned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men been\\nquick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just\\nin front of Diomed\\'s horses with a flare of burning brimstone. The\\nhorses were frightened and tried to back beneath the car, while the\\nreins dropped from Nestor\\'s hands. Then he was afraid and said to\\nDiomed, \"Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see you not that\\nthe hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafes victory to Hector;\\nto-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grant it to ourselves;\\nno man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of Jove, for he is far\\nstronger than any.\" \\n\\nDiomed answered, \"All that you have said is true; there is a grief\\nhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk among\\nthe Trojans and say, \\'The son of Tydeus fled before me to the ships.\\'\\nThis is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow me.\"\\n\\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Nestor, \"what mean you? Though Hector say\\nthat you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe\\nhim, nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.\"\\n\\nSo saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,\\nand with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their\\ndarts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, \"Son of Tydeus,\\nthe Danaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at\\ntable, the meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.\\nHenceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than\\na woman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale\\nour walls through any Hinching upon my part; neither shall you carry\\noff our wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand.\"\\n\\nThe son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his horses\\nround again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice did Jove\\nthunder from the heights of. Ida in token to the Trojans that he would\\nturn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted to them and said,\\n\"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be men,\\nmy friends, and fight with might and with main; I see that Jove is\\nminded to vouchsafe victory and great glory to myself, while he will\\ndeal destruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building\\nthis weak and worthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses\\nwill spring lightly over their trench, and when I am at their ships\\nforget not to bring me fire that I may burn them, while I slaughter\\nthe Argives who will be all dazed and bewildered by the smoke.\"\\n\\nThen he cried to his horses, \"Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon\\nand goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the honey-sweet\\ncorn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has fed you, and\\nfor she has mixed wine and water for you to drink whenever you would,\\nbefore doing so even for me who am her own husband. Haste in pursuit,\\nthat we may take the shield of Nestor, the fame of which ascends to\\nheaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rods and all, and that we may\\nstrip from the shoulders of Diomed. the cuirass which Vulcan made\\nhim. Could we take these two things, the Achaeans would set sail in\\ntheir ships this self-same night.\" \\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she shook\\nwith rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god of Neptune,\\n\"What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find no compassion\\nin your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you many a welcome\\noffering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then. If all of us\\nwho are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back and keep Jove\\nfrom helping them, he would have to sit there sulking alone on Ida.\"\\n\\nKing Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, \"Juno, rash of tongue,\\nwhat are you talking about? We other gods must not set ourselves against\\nJove, for he is far stronger than we are.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch,\\nfrom the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and warriors,\\nwho were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that the hand of\\nJove was with him. He would even have set fire to the ships and burned\\nthem, had not Queen Juno put it into the mind of Agamemnon, to bestir\\nhimself and to encourage the Achaeans. To this end he went round the\\nships and tents carrying a great purple cloak, and took his stand\\nby the huge black hull of Ulysses\\' ship, which was middlemost of all;\\nit was from this place that his voice would carry farthest, on the\\none hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other\\ntowards those of Achilles- for these two heroes, well assured of their\\nown strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends\\nof the line. From this spot then, with a voice that could be heard\\nafar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying, \"Argives, shame on you cowardly\\ncreatures, brave in semblance only; where are now our vaunts that\\nwe should prove victorious- the vaunts we made so vaingloriously in\\nLemnos, when we ate the flesh of horned cattle and filled our mixing-bowls\\nto the brim? You vowed that you would each of you stand against a\\nhundred or two hundred men, and now you prove no match even for one-\\nfor Hector, who will be ere long setting our ships in a blaze. Father\\nJove, did you ever so ruin a great king and rob him so utterly of\\nhis greatness? yet, when to my sorrow I was coming hither, I never\\nlet my ship pass your altars without offering the fat and thigh-bones\\nof heifers upon every one of them, so eager was I to sack the city\\nof Troy. Vouchsafe me then this prayer- suffer us to escape at any\\nrate with our lives, and let not the Achaeans be so utterly vanquished\\nby the Trojans.\" \\n\\nThus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him\\nthat his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle,\\nmost unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its\\ntalons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the Achaeans\\nsacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; When, therefore, the people\\nsaw that the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely upon\\nthe Trojans and fought more boldly. \\n\\nThere was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that\\nhe had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight sooner\\nthan the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he slew\\nan armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon. He had\\nturned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the back\\nmidway between his shoulders and went right through his chest, and\\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his chariot.\\n\\nAfter him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two Ajaxes\\nclothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his companion in\\narms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus the brave son\\nof Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his place under\\ncover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax lifted his shield\\nTeucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng,\\nthe man would fall dead; then Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child\\nto its mother, and again duck down under his shield. \\n\\nWhich of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and\\nthen Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike Lycophontes,\\nAmopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. these in turn did he lay\\nlow upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw him making\\nhavoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him and said,\\n\"Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain among the\\nhost, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory\\nof your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care of you in\\nhis own house when you were a child, bastard though you were. Cover\\nhim with glory though he is far off; I will promise and I will assuredly\\nperform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me to sack the city\\nof Ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after my own-\\na tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who shall go\\nup into your bed.\" \\n\\nAnd Teucer answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge\\nme; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have never\\nceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and\\nkill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buried\\nin the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was\\nbent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit\\nPriam\\'s brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair Castianeira,\\nlovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, and now he bowed\\nhis head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed down by\\nshowers in spring- even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight\\nof his helmet. \\n\\nAgain he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again\\nhis arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector\\'s\\nbrave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he\\nwas driving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as\\nhe fell headlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him.\\nHector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for\\nall his sorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother\\nCebriones, who was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he had\\nsaid. Hector thereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to the\\nground, and seizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intent\\nkill him. Teucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid\\nit upon the bow-string, but Hector struck him with the jagged stone\\nas he was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit\\nhim just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, a\\nvery deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his wrist\\nwas less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward on\\nhis knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and running towards\\nhim bestrode him and sheltered him with his shield. Meanwhile his\\ntwo trusty squires, Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, came up\\nand bore him to the ships groaning in his great pain. \\n\\nJove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the Achaeans\\nto their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their head. As\\na hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he gives\\nhim chase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did Hector\\nfollow close upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as they\\nrushed panic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set\\nstakes and trench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the hands\\nof the Trojans, they halted at their ships, calling upon one another\\nand praying every man instantly as they lifted up their hands to the\\ngods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring\\nlike those of Gorgo or murderous Mars. \\n\\nJuno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to Minerva,\\n\"Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take no more thought\\nfor the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever do so? See\\nhow they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of but a single\\nman. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury, and has\\nalready done great mischief.\" \\n\\nMinerva answered, \"Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his own\\nland, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is\\nmad with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets\\nhow often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labours Eurystheus\\nhad laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up to heaven, and\\nthen Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the sense to\\nforesee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of Hades,\\nto fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come back\\nalive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates\\nme, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed his knees\\nand took hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do honour\\nto Achilles. I shall know what to do next time he begins calling me\\nhis grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go within the\\nhouse of aegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we shall then find\\nout whether Priam\\'s son Hector will be glad to meet us in the highways\\nof battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds and vultures with\\nthe fat of their flesh as they he dead by the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,\\nobeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened steeds,\\nwhile Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her richly vesture,\\nmade with her own hands, on to the threshold of her father, and donned\\nthe shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle. Then she stepped into\\nher flaming chariot, and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and\\nstrong with which she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased\\nher. Juno lashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they\\nflew open of their own accord- gates over which the Hours preside,\\nin whose hands are heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud\\nthat hides them or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove\\ntheir obedient steeds. \\n\\nBut father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent\\nwinged Iris with a message to them. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, turn\\nthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to\\nfighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this is what\\nI mean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them\\nfrom their chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them\\nall ten years to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them;\\nmy grey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her father\\nmeans. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say\\nshe always contradicts me.\" \\n\\nWith this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights of\\nIda to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the\\nouter gates of its many valleys and gave them her message. \"What,\"\\nsaid she, \"are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbids going.\\nThis is what he says, and this is he means to do, he will lame your\\nhorses for you, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break\\nit in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal the wounds his\\nlightning will inflict upon you, that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess,\\nwhat quarrelling with your father means. He is less hurt and angry\\nwith Juno, for whatever he says she always contradicts him but you,\\nbold bold hussy, will you really dare to raise your huge spear in\\ndefiance of Jove?\" \\n\\nWith this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, \"Of a truth, child\\nof aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men\\'s battles further\\nin defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have it, and\\nlet Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans and Danaans according\\nto his own pleasure.\" \\n\\nShe turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them\\nfast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the\\nend wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon their\\ngolden thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were\\nvery angry. \\n\\nPresently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered the\\nassembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horses\\nfor him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. Jove\\nthen sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath him.\\nMinerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spoke nor\\nasked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said, \"Minerva\\nand Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing so many\\nof your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might\\nof my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were\\nboth of you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its\\nterrible doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been-\\nI should have struck you with lighting, and your chariots would never\\nhave brought you back again to Olympus.\" \\n\\nMinerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and brooded\\nmischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word, for she\\nwas in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her father;\\nbut Juno could not contain herself and said, \"What, dread son of Saturn,\\nare you talking about? We know how great your power is, nevertheless\\nwe have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are perishing and\\ncoming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain\\nfrom actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to\\nthe Argives, that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,\\nyou will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of the Argives,\\nfor fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the\\nson of Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships\\'\\nsterns about the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is how it\\nis decreed; for aught I care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath\\nearth and sea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus with\\nneither ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go\\non and on till you get there, and I shall not care one whit for your\\ndispleasure; you are the greatest vixen living.\" \\n\\nJuno made him no answer. The sun\\'s glorious orb now sank into Oceanus\\nand drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the Trojans when\\nlight failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness\\nfall upon the Achaeans. \\n\\nThen Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a council\\non the open space near the river, where there was a spot ear corpses.\\nThey left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speech\\nhe made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze point\\nof which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the spear-head\\nwas of gold Spear in hand he spoke. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"Trojans,\\nDardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I should destroy the\\nships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back to Ilius, but\\ndarkness came on too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their\\nships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey the behests of\\nnight, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots\\nand give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep\\nand cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your horses\\nand gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires\\nwhose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try to fly beyond\\nthe sea by night, and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested;\\nmany a man among them must take a dart with him to nurse at home,\\nhit with spear or arrow as he is leaping on board his ship, that others\\nmay fear to bring war and weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the\\nheralds tell it about the city that the growing youths and grey-bearded\\nmen are to camp upon its heaven-built walls. Let the women each of\\nthem light a great fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept\\nlest the town be entered by surprise while the host is outside. See\\nto it, brave Trojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the\\nmoment; at daybreak I will instruct you further. I pray in hope to\\nJove and to the gods that we may then drive those fate-sped hounds\\nfrom our land, for \\'tis the fates that have borne them and their ships\\nhither. This night, therefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning\\nlet us put on our armour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the\\nAchaeans; I shall then know whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus\\nwill drive me back from the ships to the wall, or whether I shall\\nmyself slay him and carry off his bloodstained spoils. To-morrow let\\nhim show his mettle, abide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break\\nof day, he shall be among the first to fall and many another of his\\ncomrades round him. Would that I were as sure of being immortal and\\nnever growing old, and of being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo,\\nas I am that this day will bring evil to the Argives.\" \\n\\nThus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took their\\nsweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each by his\\nown chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the city,\\nthey brought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered much\\nwood. They then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals, and\\nthe wind carried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven- but the\\nblessed gods partook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Ilius with\\nPriam and Priam\\'s people. Thus high in hope they sat through the livelong\\nnight by the highways of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle.\\nAs when the stars shine clear, and the moon is bright- there is not\\na breath of air, not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it\\nstands out in the ineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of\\nheaven; the stars can all of them be told and the heart of the shepherd\\nis glad- even thus shone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilius\\nmidway between the ships and the river Xanthus. A thousand camp-fires\\ngleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each there sat fifty men,\\nwhile the horses, champing oats and corn beside their chariots, waited\\ntill dawn should come. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK IX\\n\\nThus did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stained Rout,\\nhad taken fast hold of the Achaeans and their princes were all of\\nthem in despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace- the\\nnorth and the northwest- spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury\\nof the main- in a moment the dark waves uprear their heads and scatter\\ntheir sea-wrack in all directions- even thus troubled were the hearts\\nof the Achaeans. \\n\\nThe son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a\\ncouncil man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made haste\\nalso himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their assembly.\\nAgamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataract on the\\nside of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he spoke\\nto the Achaeans. \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes and councillors of\\nthe Argives, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel\\nJove gave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city of Troy\\nbefore returning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me\\ngo ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is\\nthe will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust as he\\nwill yet lay others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore, let\\nus all do as I say and sail back to our own country, for we shall\\nnot take Troy.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat sorrowful\\nthere, but they all held their peace, till at last Diomed of the loud\\nbattle-cry made answer saying, \"Son of Atreus, I will chide your folly,\\nas is my right in council. Be not then aggrieved that I should do\\nso. In the first place you attacked me before all the Danaans and\\nsaid that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives young and old\\nknow that you did so. But the son of scheming Saturn endowed you by\\nhalves only. He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, but valour,\\nwhich is the highest both right and might he did not give you. Sir,\\nthink you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and\\ncowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon going home-\\ngo- the way is open to you; the many ships that followed you from\\nMycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stay here\\ntill we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should turn homeward\\nwith their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still fight on till we\\nreach the goal of Ilius, for for heaven was with us when we came.\"\\n\\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed,\\nand presently Nestor rose to speak. \"Son of Tydeus,\" said he, \"in\\nwar your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all\\nwho are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light of\\nwhat you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end\\nof the whole matter. You are still young- you might be the youngest\\nof my own children- still you have spoken wisely and have counselled\\nthe chief of the Achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless I am\\nolder than you and I will tell you every\" thing; therefore let no\\nman, not even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments\\ncivil discord is a clanless, hearthless outlaw. \\n\\n\"Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers,\\nbut let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that is\\nwithout the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men;\\nwhen they have been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give your\\norders, for you are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast for\\nyour councillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so;\\nthere is abundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of the Achaeans\\nbring from Thrace daily. You have everything at your disposal wherewith\\nto entertain guests, and you have many subjects. When many are got\\ntogether, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest- and sorely\\ndo we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit his watchfires\\nhard by our ships. Who can be other than dismayed? This night will\\neither be the ruin of our host, or save it.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinels\\nwent out in their armour under command of Nestor\\'s son Thrasymedes,\\na captain of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus and Ialmenus:\\nthere were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the son of Creion,\\nnoble Lycomedes. There were seven captains of the sentinels, and with\\neach there went a hundred youths armed with long spears: they took\\ntheir places midway between the trench and the wall, and when they\\nhad done so they lit their fires and got every man his supper.\\n\\nThe son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to his\\nquarters prepared a great feast in their honour. They laid their hands\\non the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had\\nenough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose counsel was ever truest,\\nwas the first to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, with all\\nsincerity and goodwill addressed them thus. \\n\\n\"With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\\nwill I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over much\\npeople. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and\\nto uphold righteousness, that you may take thought for your people\\nunder you; therefore it behooves you above all others both to speak\\nand to give ear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have\\nbeen minded to speak wisely. All turns on you and on your commands,\\ntherefore I will say what I think will be best. No man will be of\\na truer mind than that which has been mine from the hour when you,\\nsir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent against\\nmy judgment. I urged you not to do so, but you yielded to your own\\npride, and dishonoured a hero whom heaven itself had honoured- for\\nyou still hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however,\\nlet us think how we may appease him, both with presents and fair speeches\\nthat may conciliate him.\" \\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, you have reproved my folly justly.\\nI was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in himself a host,\\nand Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroying much people\\nof the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded to my worser\\nmind; therefore I will make amends, and will give him great gifts\\nby way of atonement. I will tell them in the presence of you all.\\nI will give him seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire,\\nand ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons and\\ntwelve strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich,\\nindeed, both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as my\\nhorses have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians,\\nwhom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty.\\nI will give him these, and with them her whom I erewhile took from\\nhim, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a great oath that I never\\nwent up into her couch, nor have been with her after the manner of\\nmen and women. \\n\\n\"All these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter the gods\\nvouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when we Achaeans\\nare dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and bronze to\\nhis liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest\\nafter Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest\\nof all lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I will show him like honour\\nwith my own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance.\\nI have three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and lphianassa, let\\nhim take the one of his choice, freely and without gifts of wooing,\\nto the house of Peleus; I will add such dower to boot as no man ever\\nyet gave his daughter, and will give him seven well established cities,\\nCardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where there is grass; holy Pherae and\\nthe rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of\\nPedasus, all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The\\nmen that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour\\nhim with gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to his comfortable\\nordinances. All this will I do if he will now forgo his anger. Let\\nhim then yieldit is only Hades who is utterly ruthless and unyielding-\\nand hence he is of all gods the one most hateful to mankind. Moreover\\nI am older and more royal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey\\nme.\" \\n\\nThen Nestor answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon.\\nThe gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then send chosen messengers,\\nwho may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleus without delay. Let\\nthose go whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear to Jove, lead the way;\\nlet Ajax and Ulysses follow, and let the heralds Odius and Eurybates\\ngo with them. Now bring water for our hands, and bid all keep silence\\nwhile we pray to Jove the son of Saturn, if so be that he may have\\nmercy upon us.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants\\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the\\nmixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\\nevery man his drink-offering; then, when they had made their offerings,\\nand had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set out from\\nthe tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, looking first to\\none and then to another, but most especially at Ulysses, was instant\\nwith them that they should prevail with the noble son of Peleus.\\n\\nThey went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed earnestly\\nto earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of the son of Aeacus\\nmight incline favourably towards them. When they reached the ships\\nand tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on a lyre,\\nfair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver. It\\nwas part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the city\\nof Eetion, and he was now diverting himself with it and singing the\\nfeats of heroes. He was alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite to\\nhim and said nothing, waiting till he should cease singing. Ulysses\\nand Ajax now came in- Ulysses leading the way -and stood before him.\\nAchilles sprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and\\nPatroclus, when he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greeted\\nthem saying, \"All hail and welcome- you must come upon some great\\nmatter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nWith this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered\\nwith purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him,\\n\"Son of Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water\\nwith the wine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear\\nfriends, who are now under my roof.\" \\n\\nPatroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block in\\nfront of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the loin\\nalso of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held the meat\\nwhile Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put them\\non spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn high. When\\nthe flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on top\\nof them, lifting them up and setting them upon the spit-racks; and\\nhe sprinkled them with salt. When the meat was roasted, he set it\\non platters, and handed bread round the table in fair baskets, while\\nAchilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took his seat facing\\nUlysses against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus\\noffer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire,\\nand they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.\\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made a sign\\nto Phoenix, and when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup with wine\\nand pledged Achilles. \\n\\n\"Hail,\" said he, \"Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer, neither\\nin the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been plenty to eat\\nand drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter. Sir, we are\\nin the face of great disaster, and without your help know not whether\\nwe shall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans and their allies have\\ncamped hard by our ships and by the wall; they have lit watchfires\\nthroughout their host and deem that nothing can now prevent them from\\nfalling on our fleet. Jove, moreover, has sent his lightnings on their\\nright; Hector, in all his glory, rages like a maniac; confident that\\nJove is with him he fears neither god nor man, but is gone raving\\nmad, and prays for the approach of day. He vows that he will hew the\\nhigh sterns of our ships in pieces, set fire to their hulls, and make\\nhavoc of the Achaeans while they are dazed and smothered in smoke;\\nI much fear that heaven will make good his boasting, and it will prove\\nour lot to perish at Troy far from our home in Argos. Up, then, and\\nlate though it be, save the sons of the Achaeans who faint before\\nthe fury of the Trojans. You will repent bitterly hereafter if you\\ndo not, for when the harm is done there will be no curing it; consider\\nere it be too late, and save the Danaans from destruction.\\n\\n\"My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon,\\ndid he not charge you saying, \\'Son, Minerva and Juno will make you\\nstrong if they choose, but check your high temper, for the better\\npart is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and the Achaeans old\\nand young will respect you more for doing so.\\' These were his words,\\nbut you have forgotten them. Even now, however, be appeased, and put\\naway your anger from you. Agamemnon will make you great amends if\\nyou will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you what he has said\\nin his tent that he will give you. He will give you seven tripods\\nthat have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of gold; twenty\\niron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have won races and carried\\noff prizes. Rich indeed both in land and gold is he who has as many\\nprizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon. Moreover he will give\\nyou seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he chose for himself,\\nwhen you took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty. He will give you these,\\nand with them her whom he erewhile took from you, the daughter of\\nBriseus, and he will swear a great oath, he has never gone up into\\nher couch nor been with her after the manner of men and women. All\\nthese things will he give you now down, and if hereafter the gods\\nvouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you can come when we Achaeans\\nare dividing the spoil, and load your ship with gold and bronze to\\nyour liking. You can take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest after\\nHelen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all\\nlands, you shall be his son-in-law, and he will show you like honour\\nwith his own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance.\\nAgamemnon has three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa;\\nyou may take the one of your choice, freely and without gifts of wooing,\\nto the house of Peleus; he will add such dower to boot as no man ever\\nyet gave his daughter, and will give you seven well-established cities,\\nCardamyle, Enope, and Hire where there is grass; holy Pheras and the\\nrich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus,\\nall near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that\\ndwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour you with\\ngifts as though were a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances.\\nAll this will he do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though\\nyou hate both him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the\\nrest of the Achaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they\\nwill honour you as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands.\\nYou might even kill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he\\nis infatuated, and declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have\\nbrought can hold his own against him.\" \\n\\nAchilles answered, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give you\\nformal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be no\\nmore of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do\\nI hate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hides\\nanother in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will be\\nappeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the\\nDanaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my fighting. He that\\nfights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero are\\nheld in equal honour, and death deals like measure to him who works\\nand him who is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships- with\\nmy life ever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes\\nit to her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so man a long\\nnight have I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by\\nday against those who were fighting for their women. With my ships\\nI have taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed\\nwith my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one of\\nthem, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where\\nhe was by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept\\nmuch himself. \\n\\n\"Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the chieftains\\nand kings, and these have them still; from me alone of the Achaeans\\ndid he take the woman in whom I delighted- let him keep her and sleep\\nwith her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the Trojans? What\\nmade the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them? Was it not\\nfor the sake of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the only men in the\\nworld who love their wives? Any man of common right feeling will love\\nand cherish her who is his own, as I this woman, with my whole heart,\\nthough she was but a fruitling of my spear. Agamemnon has taken her\\nfrom me; he has played me false; I know him; let him tempt me no further,\\nfor he shall not move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses, and to the\\nother princes to save his ships from burning. He has done much without\\nme already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep and wide\\nall round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but even so\\nhe stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as I fought the\\nAchaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from the city walls;\\nhe would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak tree, but no further.\\nOnce he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escape my onset: now,\\nhowever, since I am in no mood to fight him, I will to-morrow offer\\nsacrifice to Jove and to all the gods; I will draw my ships into the\\nwater and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning, if you care to\\nlook, you will see my ships on the Hellespont, and my men rowing out\\nto sea with might and main. If great Neptune vouchsafes me a fair\\npassage, in three days I shall be in Phthia. I have much there that\\nI left behind me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shall bring\\nback still further store of gold, of red copper, of fair women, and\\nof iron, my share of the spoils that we have taken; but one prize,\\nhe who gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I now bid you,\\nand tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him and beware of\\nhim should he think that he can yet dupe others for his effrontery\\nnever fails him. \\n\\n\"As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I\\nwill take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in common\\nwith him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozen\\nme further; let him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of his\\nreason. I loathe his presents, and for himself care not one straw.\\nHe may offer me ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay-\\nnot though it be all that he has in the world, both now or ever shall\\nhave; he may promise me the wealth of Orchomenus or of Egyptian Thebes,\\nwhich is the richest city in the whole world, for it has a hundred\\ngates through each of which two hundred men may drive at once with\\ntheir chariots and horses; he may offer me gifts as the sands of the\\nsea or the dust of the plain in multitude, but even so he shall not\\nmove me till I have been revenged in full for the bitter wrong he\\nhas done me. I will not marry his daughter; she may be fair as Venus,\\nand skilful as Minerva, but I will have none of her: let another take\\nher, who may be a good match for her and who rules a larger kingdom.\\nIf the gods spare me to return home, Peleus will find me a wife; there\\nare Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia, daughters of kings that have\\ncities under them; of these I can take whom I will and marry her.\\nMany a time was I minded when at home in Phthia to woo and wed a woman\\nwho would make me a suitable wife, and to enjoy the riches of my old\\nfather Peleus. My life is more to me than all the wealth of Ilius\\nwhile it was yet at peace before the Achaeans went there, or than\\nall the treasure that lies on the stone floor of Apollo\\'s temple beneath\\nthe cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and sheep are to be had for harrying,\\nand a man buy both tripods and horses if he wants them, but when his\\nlife has once left him it can neither be bought nor harried back again.\\n\\n\"My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may\\nmeet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive but\\nmy name will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die,\\nbut it will be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of you, then,\\nI say, \\'Go home, for you will not take Ilius.\\' Jove has held his hand\\nover her to protect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore,\\nas in duty bound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans the message\\nthat I have sent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving\\nof their ships and people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the\\none that they have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him\\nsleep here that he may sail with me in the morning if he so will.\\nBut I will not take him by force.\" \\n\\nThey all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he\\nhad denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his great\\nfear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said, \"Noble\\nAchilles, if you are now minded to return, and in the fierceness of\\nyour anger will do nothing to save the ships from burning, how, my\\nson, can I remain here without you? Your father Peleus bade me go\\nwith you when he sent you as a mere lad from Phthia to Agamemnon.\\nYou knew nothing neither of war nor of the arts whereby men make their\\nmark in council, and he sent me with you to train you in all excellence\\nof speech and action. Therefore, my son, I will not stay here without\\nyou- no, not though heaven itself vouchsafe to strip my years from\\noff me, and make me young as I was when I first left Hellas the land\\nof fair women. I was then flying the anger of father Amyntor, son\\nof Ormenus, who was furious with me in the matter of his concubine,\\nof whom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother. My\\nmother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the woman\\nmyself, that so she hate my father, and in the course of time I yielded.\\nBut my father soon came to know, and cursed me bitterly, calling the\\ndread Erinyes to witness. He prayed that no son of mine might ever\\nsit upon knees- and the gods, Jove of the world below and awful Proserpine,\\nfulfilled his curse. I took counsel to kill him, but some god stayed\\nmy rashness and bade me think on men\\'s evil tongues and how I should\\nbe branded as the murderer of my father: nevertheless I could not\\nbear to stay in my father\\'s house with him so bitter a against me.\\nMy cousins and clansmen came about me, and pressed me sorely to remain;\\nmany a sheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog\\ndid they set down to roast before the fire; many a jar, too, did they\\nbroach of my father\\'s wine. Nine whole nights did they set a guard\\nover me taking it in turns to watch, and they kept a fire always burning,\\nboth in the cloister of the outer court and in the inner court at\\nthe doors of the room wherein I lay; but when the darkness of the\\ntenth night came, I broke through the closed doors of my room, and\\nclimbed the wall of the outer court after passing quickly and unperceived\\nthrough the men on guard and the women servants. I then fled through\\nHellas till I came to fertile Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King\\nPeleus, who made me welcome and treated me as a father treats an only\\nson who will be heir to all his wealth. He made me rich and set me\\nover much people, establishing me on the borders of Phthia where I\\nwas chief ruler over the Dolopians. \\n\\n\"It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with all\\nmy heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had gone\\nout elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up the\\ndainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to your\\nlips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness\\nover my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heaven\\nhad vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and I made a son of you,\\nAchilles, that in my hour of need you might protect me. Now, therefore,\\nI say battle with your pride and beat it; cherish not your anger for\\never; the might and majesty of heaven are more than ours, but even\\nheaven may be appeased; and if a man has sinned he prays the gods,\\nand reconciles them to himself by his piteous cries and by frankincense,\\nwith drink-offerings and the savour of burnt sacrifice. For prayers\\nare as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes askance,\\nthey follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being fierce and fleet of\\nfoot, leaves them far behind him, and ever baneful to mankind outstrips\\nthem even to the ends of the world; but nevertheless the prayers come\\nhobbling and healing after. If a man has pity upon these daughters\\nof Jove when they draw near him, they will bless him and hear him\\ntoo when he is praying; but if he deny them and will not listen to\\nthem, they go to Jove the son of Saturn and pray that he may presently\\nfall into sin- to his ruing bitterly hereafter. Therefore, Achilles,\\ngive these daughters of Jove due reverence, and bow before them as\\nall good men will bow. Were not the son of Atreus offering you gifts\\nand promising others later- if he were still furious and implacable-\\nI am not he that would bid you throw off your anger and help the Achaeans,\\nno matter how great their need; but he is giving much now, and more\\nhereafter; he has sent his captains to urge his suit, and has chosen\\nthose who of all the Argives are most acceptable to you; make not\\nthen their words and their coming to be of none effect. Your anger\\nhas been righteous so far. We have heard in song how heroes of old\\ntime quarrelled when they were roused to fury, but still they could\\nbe won by gifts, and fair words could soothe them. \\n\\n\"I have an old story in my mind- a very old one- but you are all friends\\nand I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians were fighting and\\nkilling one another round Calydon- the Aetolians defending the city\\nand the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Diana of the golden throne\\nwas angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had not offered her his\\nharvest first-fruits. The other gods had all been feasted with hecatombs,\\nbut to the daughter of great Jove alone he had made no sacrifice.\\nHe had forgotten her, or somehow or other it had escaped him, and\\nthis was a grievous sin. Thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure\\nsent a prodigious creature against him- a savage wild boar with great\\nwhite tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands, uprooting apple-trees\\nin full bloom and throwing them to the ground. But Meleager son of\\nOeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities and killed it- for\\nit was so monstrous that not a few were needed, and many a man did\\nit stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this the goddess set the Curetes\\nand the Aetolians fighting furiously about the head and skin of the\\nboar. \\n\\n\"So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the Curetes,\\nand for all their numbers they could not hold their ground under the\\ncity walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angered as even\\na wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed with his mother Althaea,\\nand therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fair Cleopatra,\\nwho was daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and of Ides the man\\nthen living. He it was who took his bow and faced King Apollo himself\\nfor fair Marpessa\\'s sake; her father and mother then named her Alcyone,\\nbecause her mother had mourned with the plaintive strains of the halcyon-bird\\nwhen Phoebus Apollo had carried her off. Meleager, then, stayed at\\nhome with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt by reason of\\nhis mother\\'s curses. His mother, grieving for the death of her brother,\\nprayed the gods, and beat the earth with her hands, calling upon Hades\\nand on awful Proserpine; she went down upon her knees and her bosom\\nwas wet with tears as she prayed that they would kill her son- and\\nErinys that walks in darkness and knows no ruth heard her from Erebus.\\n\\n\"Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and\\nthe dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon the elders\\nof the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest of their\\npriests, and begged him to come out and help them, promising him a\\ngreat reward. They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the most fertile\\nin the plain of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the other open\\nplough-land. The old warrior Oeneus implored him, standing at the\\nthreshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. His sisters\\nand his mother herself besought him sore, but he the more refused\\nthem; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to him also\\nprayed him, but they could not move him till the foe was battering\\nat the very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaled the walls\\nand were setting fire to the city. Then at last his sorrowing wife\\ndetailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken; she reminded\\nhim how the men are slain, and the city is given over to the flames,\\nwhile the women and children are carried into captivity; when he heard\\nall this, his heart was touched, and he donned his armour to go forth.\\nThus of his own inward motion he saved the city of the Aetolians;\\nbut they now gave him nothing of those rich rewards that they had\\noffered earlier, and though he saved the city he took nothing by it.\\nBe not then, my son, thus minded; let not heaven lure you into any\\nsuch course. When the ships are burning it will be a harder matter\\nto save them. Take the gifts, and go, for the Achaeans will then honour\\nyou as a god; whereas if you fight without taking them, you may beat\\nthe battle back, but you will not be held in like honour.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no\\nneed of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will abide\\nwith me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs are\\nstrong. I say further- and lay my saying to your heart- vex me no\\nmore with this weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son\\nof Atreus. Love him so well, and you may lose the love I bear you.\\nYou ought to help me rather in troubling those that trouble me; be\\nking as much as I am, and share like honour with myself; the others\\nshall take my answer; stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in\\nyour bed; at daybreak we will consider whether to remain or go.\"\\n\\nOn this she nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to prepare\\na bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take their leave. Ajax\\nson of Telamon then said, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, let us be\\ngone, for I see that our journey is vain. We must now take our answer,\\nunwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who are waiting to receive\\nit. Achilles is savage and remorseless; he is cruel, and cares nothing\\nfor the love his comrades lavished upon him more than on all the others.\\nHe is implacable- and yet if a man\\'s brother or son has been slain\\nhe will accept a fine by way of amends from him that killed him, and\\nthe wrong-doer having paid in full remains in peace among his own\\npeople; but as for you, Achilles, the gods have put a wicked unforgiving\\nspirit in your heart, and this, all about one single girl, whereas\\nwe now offer you the seven best we have, and much else into the bargain.\\nBe then of a more gracious mind, respect the hospitality of your own\\nroof. We are with you as messengers from the host of the Danaans,\\nand would fain he held nearest and dearest to yourself of all the\\nAchaeans.\" \\n\\n\"Ajax,\" replied Achilles, \"noble son of Telamon, you have spoken much\\nto my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, and remember\\nhow the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though I were some\\nvile tramp, and that too in the presence of the Argives. Go, then,\\nand deliver your message; say that I will have no concern with fighting\\ntill Hector, son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of the Myrmidons\\nin his murderous course, and flings fire upon their ships. For all\\nhis lust of battle, I take it he will be held in check when he is\\nat my own tent and ship.\" \\n\\nOn this they took every man his double cup, made their drink-offerings,\\nand went back to the ships, Ulysses leading the way. But Patroclus\\ntold his men and the maid-servants to make ready a comfortable bed\\nfor Phoenix; they therefore did so with sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet\\nof fine linen. The old man then laid himself down and waited till\\nmorning came. But Achilles slept in an inner room, and beside him\\nthe daughter of Phorbas lovely Diomede, whom he had carried off from\\nLesbos. Patroclus lay on the other side of the room, and with him\\nfair Iphis whom Achilles had given him when he took Scyros the city\\nof Enyeus. \\n\\nWhen the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeans\\nrose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. King\\nAgamemnon was the first to do so. Tell me, Ulysses,\" said he, \"will\\nhe save the ships from burning, or did be refuse, and is he still\\nfurious?\" \\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\\nAchilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever,\\nand spurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with\\nthe Achaeans to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself,\\nhe said that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water.\\nHe said further that he should advise every one to sail home likewise,\\nfor that you will not reach the goal of Ilius. \\'Jove,\\' he said, \\'has\\nlaid his hand over the city to protect it, and the people have taken\\nheart.\\' This is what he said, and the others who were with me can\\ntell you the same story- Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them,\\nwho may be trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep,\\nfor so Achilles would have it, that he might go home with him in the\\nmorning if he so would; but he will not take him by force.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and dejected,\\nby reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refused them, till\\npresently Diomed said, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\\nyou ought not to have sued the son of Peleus nor offered him gifts.\\nHe is proud enough as it is, and you have encouraged him in his pride\\nam further. Let him stay or go as he will. He will fight later when\\nhe is in the humour, and heaven puts it in his mind to do so. Now,\\ntherefore, let us all do as I say; we have eaten and drunk our fill,\\nlet us then take our rest, for in rest there is both strength and\\nstay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears, forthwith bring out\\nyour host and your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them on,\\nand yourself fighting among the foremost.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They then\\nmade their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent, where\\nthey laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK X\\n\\nNow the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night\\nthrough, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he could\\nget no rest. As when fair Juno\\'s lord flashes his lightning in token\\nof great rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground,\\nor again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war,\\neven so did Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled\\nwithin him. When he looked upon the plain of Troy he marvelled at\\nthe many watchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at the sound of\\npipes and flutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned\\ntowards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls\\nbefore Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness of\\nhis soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at once to Nestor son\\nof Neleus, and see if between them they could find any way of the\\nAchaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt, bound\\nhis sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny\\nlion over his shoulders- a skin that reached his feet- and took his\\nspear in his hand. \\n\\nNeither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives\\nwho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the Trojans.\\nHe covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther, put\\na casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny\\nhand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most powerful\\nof the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though he were\\na god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting his goodly\\narray about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his brother\\nhad come. \\n\\nMenelaus spoke first. \"Why,\" said he, \"my dear brother, are you thus\\narming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the Trojans?\\nI greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and spy upon\\nthe enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of great daring.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd\\ncounsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his\\nmind, and inclines towards Hector\\'s sacrifices rather than ours. I\\nnever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in\\none day as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans-\\nand that too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god\\nnor goddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore,\\nwith all speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.\\nMeanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among\\nthe companies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they\\nwill listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and Meriones\\nbrother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. It was to them\\nmore particularly that we gave this charge.\" \\n\\nMenelaus replied, \"How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with them\\nand wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given\\nyour orders?\" \"Wait,\" answered King Agamemnon, \"for there are so many\\npaths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man\\non your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and\\nby his father\\'s name, give each all titular observance, and stand\\nnot too much upon your own dignity; we must take our full share of\\ntoil, for at our birth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us.\"\\n\\nWith these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went on\\nto Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent\\nhard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him- his shield,\\nhis two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle\\nwith which the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people\\ninto battle- for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his\\nelbow and looked up at Agamemnon. \"Who is it,\" said he, \"that goes\\nthus about the host and the ships alone and in the dead of night,\\nwhen men are sleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for\\nsome comrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but speak. What\\nis your business?\" \\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\\nname, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has laid labour\\nand sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my limbs carry\\nme. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my\\nheart is big with war and with the jeopardy of the Achaeans. I am\\nin great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without sure counsel;\\nmy heart beats as though it would leap out of my body, and my limbs\\nfail me. If then you can do anything- for you too cannot sleep- let\\nus go the round of the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with\\ntoil and sleeping to the neglect of their duty. The enemy is encamped\\nhard and we know not but he may attack us by night.\" \\n\\nNestor replied, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\\nJove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he will\\nhave troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger.\\nI will go with you, and we will rouse others, either the son of Tydeus,\\nor Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some one\\nhad also better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their ships\\nare not near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however refrain\\nfrom blaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him- and I will\\nsay so plainly, even at the risk of offending you- for sleeping and\\nleaving all this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about imploring\\naid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme danger.\"\\n\\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly,\\nfor he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself- not indeed\\nfrom sloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects\\nme to take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before\\nI was, and came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to\\ncall the very men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We\\nshall find them with the watch outside the gates, for it was there\\nI said that we would meet them.\" \\n\\n\"In that case,\" answered Nestor, \"the Argives will not blame him nor\\ndisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them instructions.\"\\n\\nWith this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his comely\\nfeet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large, and\\nof a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear,\\nand wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First he called\\nloudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he was\\nsoon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent\\nand said, \"Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the\\nline of the ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that you\\nfind so urgent?\" And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, \"Ulysses, noble\\nson of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits.\\nCome with me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with\\nus whether we shall fight or fly.\" \\n\\nOn this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about his\\nshoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son of\\nTydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his\\ncomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as\\nfor their spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts\\nthat were driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed\\nafar like the lightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon\\nthe skin of an ox, with a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor\\nwent up to him and stirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding\\nhim and urging him to bestir himself. \"Wake up,\" he exclaimed, \"son\\nof Tydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? Can you not see that\\nthe Trojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships,\\nwith but a little space between us and them?\" \\n\\nOn these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, \"Old man, your\\nheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are there\\nno younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the\\nprinces? There is no tiring you.\" \\n\\nAnd Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, \"My son, all that you have\\nsaid is true. I have good sons, and also much people who might call\\nthe chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and\\ndeath are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for\\nyou are younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet\\nson of Phyleus.\" \\n\\nDiomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders- a\\nskin that reached his feet- and grasped his spear. When he had roused\\nthe heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the round\\nof those who were on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at\\ntheir posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As\\nsheep dogs that watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear\\na wild beast coming through the mountain forest towards them- forthwith\\nthere is a hue and cry of dogs and men, and slumber is broken- even\\nso was sleep chased from the eyes of the Achaeans as they kept the\\nwatches of the wicked night, for they turned constantly towards the\\nplain whenever they heard any stir among the Trojans. The old man\\nwas glad bade them be of good cheer. \"Watch on, my children,\" said\\nhe, \"and let not sleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph\\nover us.\" \\n\\nWith this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of the\\nAchaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the brave\\nson of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were\\nbeyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held their meeting\\non the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses, for it\\nwas here that when night fell Hector had turned back from his onslaught\\non the Argives. They sat down, therefore, and held debate with one\\nanother. \\n\\nNestor spoke first. \"My friends,\" said he, \"is there any man bold\\nenough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or us news\\nof what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by the ships\\naway from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\\nthey will retire within their walls. If he could learn all this and\\ncome back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in the mouths\\nof all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs from all\\nour ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb- which\\nis a present of surpassing value- and he would be asked as a guest\\nto all feasts and clan-gatherings.\" \\n\\nThey all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke saying,\\n\"Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over against\\nus, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greater confidence\\nand comfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some opportunity\\nwhich the other has not caught sight of; if a man is alone he is less\\nfull of resource, and his wit is weaker.\" \\n\\nOn this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes, servants\\nof Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did\\nMenelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host of\\nthe Trojans, for he was ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon\\nking of men spoke thus: \"Diomed,\" said he, \"son of Tydeus, man after\\nmy own heart, choose your comrade for yourself- take the best man\\nof those that have offered, for many would now go with you. Do not\\nthrough delicacy reject the better man, and take the worst out of\\nrespect for his lineage, because he is of more royal blood.\"\\n\\nHe said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, \"If\\nyou bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I fail\\nto think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face\\nall kinds of danger- and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were\\nto go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is\\nquick to see and understand.\" \\n\\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Ulysses, \"say neither good nor ill about\\nme, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, for\\nthe night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,\\ntwo-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone\\nleft us.\" \\n\\nThey then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son\\nof Tydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his\\nship) and on his head he set a helmet of bull\\'s hide without either\\npeak or crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear.\\nMeriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set\\na leathern helmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern\\nthongs, while on the outside it was thickly studded with boar\\'s teeth,\\nwell and skilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner lining\\nof felt. This helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out of Eleon when\\nhe broke into the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. He gave it to Amphidamas\\nof Cythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift\\nto Molus, who gave it to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon\\nthe head of Ulysses. \\n\\nWhen the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains\\nbehind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon\\ntheir right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they\\nheard its cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to Minerva:\\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who spy\\nout all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships; befriend\\nme in this mine hour, and grant that we may return to the ships covered\\nwith glory after having achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring\\nsorrow to the Trojans.\" \\n\\nThen Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: \"Hear me too,\" said he,\\n\"daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with my\\nnoble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the Achaeans.\\nHe left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus, and went to\\nthe city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; on his return\\nthence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring, for\\nyou were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard me now, and\\nin return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a\\nyear old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I\\nwill gild her horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\"\\n\\nThus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they\\nhad done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their way\\nlike two lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained\\nbodies of them that had fallen. \\n\\nNeither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called\\nthe princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his counsel\\nbefore them. \"Is there one,\" said he, \"who for a great reward will\\ndo me the service of which I will tell you? He shall be well paid\\nif he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the\\nfleetest that can be found at the ships of the Achaeans, if he will\\ndare this thing; and he will win infinite honour to boot; he must\\ngo to the ships and find out whether they are still guarded as heretofore,\\nor whether now that we have beaten them the Achaeans design to fly,\\nand through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain\\nman named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald- a man rich in\\ngold and bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an\\nonly son among five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans.\\n\"I, Hector,\" said he, \"Will to the ships and will exploit them. But\\nfirst hold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the chariot,\\nbedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry the noble son of\\nPeleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail you. I will\\ngo through the host from one end to the other till I come to the ship\\nof Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are now\\nconsulting whether they shall fight or fly.\" \\n\\nWhen he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore him\\nhis oath saying, \"May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear witness\\nthat no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that\\nyou shall have your will with them for ever.\" \\n\\nThe oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on going.\\nHe hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore the skin\\nof a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret skin. Then\\nhe took a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships, but he\\nwas not to return with any news for Hector. When he had left the horses\\nand the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but Ulysses\\nperceived his coming and said to Diomed, \"Diomed, here is some one\\nfrom the camp; I am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is\\nsome thief who would plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a\\nlittle past us, we can then spring upon him and take him. If, however,\\nhe is too quick for us, go after him with your spear and hem him in\\ntowards the ships away from the Trojan camp, to prevent his getting\\nback to the town.\" \\n\\nWith this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses.\\nDolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had got\\nabout as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds\\none that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land\\nquicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their footsteps\\nhe stood still, for he made sure they were friends from the Trojan\\ncamp come by Hector\\'s orders to bid him return; when, however, they\\nwere only a spear\\'s cast, or less away form him, he saw that they\\nwere enemies as fast as his legs could take him. The others gave chase\\nat once, and as a couple of well-trained hounds press forward after\\na doe or hare that runs screaming in front of them, even so did the\\nson of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cut him off from his own\\npeople. But when he had fled so far towards the ships that he would\\nsoon have fallen in with the outposts, Minerva infused fresh strength\\ninto the son of Tydeus for fear some other of the Achaeans might have\\nthe glory of being first to hit him, and he might himself be only\\nsecond; he therefore sprang forward with his spear and said, \"Stand,\\nor I shall throw my spear, and in that case I shall soon make an end\\nof you.\" \\n\\nHe threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew\\nover the man\\'s right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He stood\\nstock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered, and\\nhe turned pale with fear. The two came breathless up to him and seized\\nhis hands, whereon he began to weep and said, \"Take me alive; I will\\nransom myself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron,\\nand from this my father will satisfy you with a very large ransom,\\nshould he hear of my being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\n\"Fear not,\" replied Ulysses, \"let no thought of death be in your mind;\\nbut tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about alone\\nin the dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships, while\\nother men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies of the slain,\\nor did Hector send you to spy out what was going on at the ships?\\nOr did you come here of your own mere notion?\" \\n\\nDolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: \"Hector, with his\\nvain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He said\\nhe would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his bronze-bedizened\\nchariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the flying night, get\\nclose to the enemy, and find out whether the ships are still guarded\\nas heretofore, or whether, now that we have beaten them, the Achaeans\\ndesign to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep\\ntheir watches.\" \\n\\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \"You had indeed set your heart\\nupon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are\\nhardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles\\nhimself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and tell me true,\\nwhere did you leave Hector when you started? Where lies his armour\\nand his horses? How, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of the\\nTrojans ordered? What are their plans? Will they stay here by the\\nships and away from the city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\\nwill they retire within their walls?\" \\n\\nAnd Dolon answered, \"I will tell you truly all. Hector and the other\\ncouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of great Ilus,\\naway from the general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask\\nme, there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host. The Trojans\\nhave their watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they, therefore,\\nare awake and keep each other to their duty as sentinels; but the\\nallies who have come from other places are asleep and leave it to\\nthe Trojans to keep guard, for their wives and children are not here.\"\\n\\nUlysses then said, \"Now tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan\\ntroops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may understand it.\"\\n\\n\"I will tell you truly all,\" replied Dolon. \"To the seaward lie the\\nCarians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and the\\nnoble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and\\nMeonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask\\nabout an this? If you want to find your way into the host of the Trojans,\\nthere are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lie apart from\\nthe others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesus son of\\nEioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongest that\\nI have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any wind\\nthat blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and he has\\nbrought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarest workmanship- too\\nsplendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet only for the gods.\\nNow, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely here, until\\nyou come back and have proved my words whether they be false or true.\"\\n\\nDiomed looked sternly at him and answered, \"Think not, Dolon, for\\nall the good information you have given us, that you shall escape\\nnow you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you\\nwill come some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as\\na spy or as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you\\nwill give no more trouble.\" \\n\\nOn this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him further,\\nbut Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his sword and\\ncut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the dust\\nwhile he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his\\nhead, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses\\nhung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and\\nprayed saying, \"Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in\\npreference to all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still further\\ntowards the horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians.\"\\n\\nWith these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree,\\nand they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs\\nof tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through\\nthe\\' flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid the\\nfallen armour and the blood, and came presently to the company of\\nThracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with their day\\'s toil;\\ntheir goodly armour was lying on the ground beside them all orderly\\nin three rows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus\\nwas sleeping in the middle, and hard by him his horses were made fast\\nto the topmost rim of his chariot. Ulysses from some way off saw him\\nand said, \"This, Diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about\\nwhich Dolon whom we killed told us. Do your very utmost; dally not\\nabout your armour, but loose the horses at once- or else kill the\\nmen yourself, while I see to the horses.\" \\n\\nThereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote\\nthem right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being\\nhacked about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion springs\\nfuriously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds without their\\nshepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian soldiers\\ntill he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and drew\\nthem aside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go forward\\nfreely without being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies,\\nfor they were not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to\\nthe king, he killed him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing\\nhard, for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the seed of Oeneus,\\nhovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses untied the horses,\\nmade them fast one to another and drove them off, striking them with\\nhis bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then\\nhe whistled as a sign to Diomed. \\n\\nBut Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he\\nmight accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which\\nthe king\\'s armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift\\nthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill\\nsome more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up\\nto him and said, \"Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be driven\\nthither, should some other god rouse the Trojans.\" \\n\\nDiomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the horses.\\nUlysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the ships of\\nthe Achaeans. \\n\\nBut Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the son\\nof Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the Trojans\\nhe roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman\\nof Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses\\nwere no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping in their\\ndeath-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend\\nby name. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people\\nkept hurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes\\nwho had now got away towards the ships. \\n\\nWhen they reached the place where they had killed Hector\\'s scout,\\nUlysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the ground,\\nplaced the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and remounted:\\nthen he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward nothing loth\\ntowards the ships as though of their own free will. Nestor was first\\nto hear the tramp of their feet. \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes and\\ncounsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right or wrong?- but I must\\nsay what I think: there is a sound in my ears as of the tramp of horses.\\nI hope it may Diomed and Ulysses driving in horses from the Trojans,\\nbut I much fear that the bravest of the Argives may have come to some\\nharm at their hands.\" \\n\\nHe had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,\\nwhereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and congratulated\\nthem. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question them. \"Tell me,\"\\nsaid he, \"renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by these horses?\\nDid you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you\\nand give them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant\\nwith the Trojans, for old warrior though I am I never hold back by\\nthe ships, but I never yet saw or heard of such horses as these are.\\nSurely some god must have met you and given them to you, for you are\\nboth of dear to Jove, and to Jove\\'s daughter Minerva.\" \\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\\nname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than these,\\nfor the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses, however,\\nabout which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomed killed\\ntheir king with the twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the\\nships we took a thirteenth man- a scout whom Hector and the other\\nTrojans had sent as a spy upon our ships.\" \\n\\nHe laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while\\nthe other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly\\nbuilt quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs\\nof leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood eating\\ntheir sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils of Dolon\\nat the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering\\nto Minerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea and washed the\\nsweat from their bodies, and from their necks and thighs. When the\\nsea-water had taken all the sweat from off them, and had refreshed\\nthem, they went into the baths and washed themselves. After they had\\nso done and had anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table,\\nand drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of wine\\nto Minerva. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XI\\n\\nAnd now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of\\nlight alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord with\\nthe ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. She took\\nher stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses\\' ship which was middlemost\\nof all, so that her voice might carry farthest on either side, on\\nthe one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the\\nother towards those of Achilles- for these two heroes, well-assured\\nof their own strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the\\ntwo ends of the line. There she took her stand, and raised a cry both\\nloud and shrill that filled the Achaeans with courage, giving them\\nheart to fight resolutely and with all their might, so that they had\\nrather stay there and do battle than go home in their ships.\\n\\nThe son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves\\nfor battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodly\\ngreaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle clasps of silver;\\nand about his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras had once\\ngiven him as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far as Cyprus\\nthat the Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore he gave\\nit to the king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of gold,\\nand ten of tin. There were serpents of cyanus that reared themselves\\nup towards the neck, three upon either side, like the rainbows which\\nthe son of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal men. About\\nhis shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and\\nthe scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang\\nit. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered his body\\nwhen he was in battle- fair to see, with ten circles of bronze running\\nall round see, wit it. On the body of the shield there were twenty\\nbosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the middle: this\\nlast was made to show a Gorgon\\'s head, fierce and grim, with Rout\\nand Panic on either side. The band for the arm to go through was of\\nsilver, on which there was a writhing snake of cyanus with three heads\\nthat sprang from a single neck, and went in and out among one another.\\nOn his head Agamemnon set a helmet, with a peak before and behind,\\nand four plumes of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; then\\nhe grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his\\narmour shot from him as a flame into the firmament, while Juno and\\nMinerva thundered in honour of the king of rich Mycene. \\n\\nEvery man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold\\nthem in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on foot\\nclad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the dawning.\\nThe chiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got there,\\nbut these came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portent of evil\\nsound about their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for he was\\nabout to send many a brave man hurrying down to Hades. \\n\\nThe Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain,\\nwere gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who was\\nhonoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of Antenor,\\nPolybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god. Hector\\'s round\\nshield showed in the front rank, and as some baneful star that shines\\nfor a moment through a rent in the clouds and is again hidden beneath\\nthem; even so was Hector now seen in the front ranks and now again\\nin the hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamed like the lightning\\nof aegis-bearing Jove. \\n\\nAnd now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a\\nrich man\\'s land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so did\\nthe Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood\\nfor yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the better\\nof the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the\\nonly god that went among them; the others were not there, but stayed\\nquietly each in his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus.\\nAll of them blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to Live victory to\\nthe Trojans, but father Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all,\\nand sat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city\\nof the Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and\\nalike upon the slayers and on the slain. \\n\\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their darts\\nrained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hour\\ndrew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get\\nhis midday meal- for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is\\ntired out, and must now have food- then the Danaans with a cry that\\nrang through all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon\\nled them on, and slew first Bienor, a leader of his people, and afterwards\\nhis comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprang from his chariot and\\nwas coming full towards him; but Agamemnon struck him on the forehead\\nwith his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail against the weapon,\\nwhich pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were battered\\nin and he was killed in full fight. \\n\\nAgamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with their\\nbreasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went on to\\nkill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the other\\nborn in wedlock; they were in the same chariot- the bastard driving,\\nwhile noble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had once taken both\\nof them prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them with fresh\\nwithes as they were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them;\\nnow, however, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in the chest above\\nthe nipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphus hard by the ear\\nand threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he stripped their goodly\\narmour from off them and recognized them, for he had already seen\\nthem at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida. As a lion fastens\\non the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great jaws, robbing\\nthem of their tender life while he on his way back to his lair- the\\nhind can do nothing for them even though she be close by, for she\\nis in an agony of fear, and flies through the thick forest, sweating,\\nand at her utmost speed before the mighty monster- so, no man of the\\nTrojans could help Isus and Antiphus, for they were themselves flying\\npanic before the Argives. \\n\\nThen King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and\\nbrave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in preventing\\nHelen\\'s being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely bribed by Alexandrus;\\nand now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the same chariot, trying\\nto bring their horses to a stand- for they had lost hold of the reins\\nand the horses were mad with fear. The son of Atreus sprang upon them\\nlike a lion, and the pair besought him from their chariot. \"Take us\\nalive,\" they cried, \"son of Atreus, and you shall receive a great\\nransom for us. Our father Antimachus has great store of gold, bronze,\\nand wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy you with a very large\\nransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nWith such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but they\\nheard no pitiful answer in return. \"If,\" said Agamemnon, \"you are\\nsons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed that\\nMenelaus and Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be killed\\nand not suffered to return, you shall now pay for the foul iniquity\\nof your father.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth, smiting\\nhim on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost upon\\nthe ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he\\ncut off his hands and his head- which he sent rolling in among the\\ncrowd as though it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and wherever\\nthe ranks were thickest thither he flew, while the other Achaeans\\nfollowed. Foot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in rout\\nbefore them, and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen, and\\nthe thundering tramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust frim off\\nthe plain. King Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and cheering\\non the Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze- the eddying\\ngusts whirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and are\\nconsumed before the blast of the flame- even so fell the heads of\\nthe flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and many a noble\\npair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways of war, for\\nlack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful now to vultures\\nthan to their wives. \\n\\nJove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage and\\ndin of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling out lustily\\nto the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son of Dardanus,\\nin the middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild fig-tree\\nmaking always for the city- the son of Atreus still shouting, and\\nwith hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the Scaean\\ngates and the oak tree, there they halted and waited for the others\\nto come up. Meanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over the middle of\\nthe plain like a herd cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked\\nthem in the dead of night- he springs on one of them, seizes her neck\\nin the grip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges\\nhimself upon her entrails- even so did King Agamemnon son of Atreus\\npursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they fled pell-mell\\nbefore him. Many a man was flung headlong from his chariot by the\\nhand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded his spear with fury.\\n\\nBut when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city, the\\nfather of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat, thunderbolt\\nin hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He then told Iris\\nof the golden wings to carry a message for him. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet\\nIris, and speak thus to Hector- say that so long as he sees Agamemnon\\nheading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, he is to keep\\naloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon\\nis wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then\\nwill I vouchsafe him strength to slay till he reach the ships and\\nnight falls at the going down of the sun.\" \\n\\nIris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the\\ncrests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariot\\nand horses. Then she said, \"Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in counsel,\\nfather Jove has sent me to bear you this message- so long as you see\\nAgamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, you\\nare to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,\\nbut when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes\\nto his chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till\\nyou reach the ships, and till night falls at the going down of the\\nsun.\" \\n\\nWhen she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armed\\nfrom his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went about\\neverywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and stirring\\nthe dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round, and again\\nmet the Achaeans, while the Argives on their part strengthened their\\nbattalions. The battle was now in array and they stood face to face\\nwith one another, Agamemnon ever pressing forward in his eagerness\\nto be ahead of all others. \\n\\nTell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who, whether\\nof the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face Agamemnon? It\\nwas Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and of great stature,\\nwho was brought up in fertile Thrace the mother of sheep. Cisses,\\nhis mother\\'s father, brought him up in his own house when he was a\\nchild- Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reached manhood, Cisses\\nwould have kept him there, and was for giving him his daughter in\\nmarriage, but as soon as he had married he set out to fight the Achaeans\\nwith twelve ships that followed him: these he had left at Percote\\nand had come on by land to Ilius. He it was that naw met Agamemnon\\nson of Atreus. When they were close up with one another, the son of\\nAtreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on the girdle below the\\ncuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strength\\nof arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for the\\npoint of the spear struck against the silver and was turned aside\\nas though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from his hand,\\nand drew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he then drew his\\nsword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the neck. So there\\nthe poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed\\nin the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from his wedded wife, of\\nwhom he had had no joy though he had given much for her: he had given\\na hundred-head of cattle down, and had promised later on to give a\\nthousand sheep and goats mixed, from the countless flocks of which\\nhe was possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreus then despoiled him, and\\ncarried off his armour into the host of the Achaeans. \\n\\nWhen noble Coon, Antenor\\'s eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were\\nhis eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon he\\ngot beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his\\narm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the\\narm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for this\\ndid he leave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that\\nflew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon Coon who was trying to\\ndrag off the body of his brother- his father\\'s son- by the foot, and\\nwas crying for help to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon\\nstruck him with a bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was dragging\\nthe dead body through the press of men under cover of his shield:\\nhe then cut off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas. Thus\\ndid the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son of\\nAtreus, and go down into the house of Hades. \\n\\nAs long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon went\\nabout attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and with\\ngreat handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and\\nthe wound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which\\nthe Eilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno and dispensers\\nof cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour- even so sharp\\nwere the pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot,\\nand bade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was in great agony.\\nWith a loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, \"My friends, princes\\nand counsellors of the Argives, defend the ships yourselves, for Jove\\nhas not suffered me to fight the whole day through against the Trojans.\"\\n\\nWith this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and\\nthey flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam\\nand their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of\\nthe battle. \\n\\nWhen Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the Trojans\\nand Lycians saying, \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors, be\\nmen, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their best\\nman has left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph; charge\\nthe foe with your chariots that. you may win still greater glory.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a huntsman\\nhounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did Hector,\\npeer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans. Full\\nof hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight like\\nsome fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes its\\ndeep blue waters into fury. \\n\\nWhat, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed\\nin the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus,\\nAutonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus;\\nAesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains\\nof the Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank and\\nfile. As when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south\\nand beats them down with the fierceness of its fury- the waves of\\nthe sea roll high, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the\\nwandering wind- even so thick were the heads of them that fell by\\nthe hand of Hector. \\n\\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would\\nhave fled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to Diomed,\\n\"Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget our prowess?\\nCome, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, we shall be shamed\\nfor ever if Hector takes the ships.\" \\n\\nAnd Diomed answered, \"Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shall\\nhave scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to the Trojans\\nrather than to us.\" \\n\\nWith these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the ground,\\nsmiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysses killed\\nMolion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that they had stopped\\ntheir fighting; the two heroes then went on playing havoc with the\\nfoe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the hounds that\\nhunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slay them, and\\nthe Achaeans were thankful to have breathing time in their flight\\nfrom Hector. \\n\\nThey then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of Merops\\nof Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of divination. He\\nhad forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would not obey him,\\nfor fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son of Tydeus slew them\\nboth and stripped them of their armour, while Ulysses killed Hippodamus\\nand Hypeirochus. \\n\\nAnd now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained that\\nneither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing one\\nanother. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in the\\nhip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to fly\\nwith, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of\\nit at some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremost\\nuntil he lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed and Ulysses\\nwere making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed by\\nthe Trojan ranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and\\nsaid to Ulysses who was beside him, \"Great Hector is bearing down\\nupon us and we shall be undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss his\\nmark. He had aimed at Hector\\'s head near the top of his helmet, but\\nbronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spear\\nwas stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal, which\\nPhoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a great bound\\nunder cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped himself\\nwith his brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had fallen\\non his eyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among\\nthe foremost fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the\\nground; meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing back into\\nhis chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life.\\nBut Diomed made at him with his spear and said, \"Dog, you have again\\ngot away though death was close on your heels. Phoebus Apollo, to\\nwhom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, has again saved you,\\nnevertheless I will meet you and make and end of you hereafter, if\\nthere is any god who will stand by me too and be my helper. For the\\npresent I must pursue those I can lay hands on.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, but\\nAlexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaning\\nagainst a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son\\nof Dardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass\\nfrom off the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the\\nshield from off his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly\\nan arrow that sped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat\\nof Diomed\\'s right foot, going right through it and fixing itself in\\nthe ground. Thereon Paris with a hearty laugh sprang forward from\\nhis hiding-place, and taunted him saying, \"You are wounded- my arrow\\nhas not been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly\\nand killed you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a\\nlion, would have had a truce from evil.\" \\n\\nDiomed all undaunted answered, \"Archer, you who without your bow are\\nnothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single\\ncombat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serve\\nyou in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched\\nthe sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy\\nhad hit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when\\nI wound a man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for\\nmy weapon will lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief\\nand his children will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening\\nthe earth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round\\nhim.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this\\ncover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the\\npain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot and\\nbade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.\\n\\nUlysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for they\\nwere all panic-stricken. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in his dismay,\\n\"what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before these\\nodds, but it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner,\\nfor the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic.\\nBut why talk to myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards\\nquit the field, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand\\nfirm and hold his own.\" \\n\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced\\nand hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to me it. As hounds\\nand lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair whetting\\nhis white tusks- they attack him from every side and can hear the\\ngnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold their\\nground- even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses. First he\\nsprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on the shoulder\\nwith a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. After these\\nhe struck Chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he had just\\nsprung down from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutched\\nthe earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went on\\nto wound Charops son of Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus,\\nhero that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he was close\\nto Ulysses he said, \"Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil,\\nthis day you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of\\nHippasus and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before\\nmy spear.\" \\n\\nWith these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went through\\nthe shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass, tearing\\nthe flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not suffer it to pierce\\nthe entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hour was not yet come,\\nbut he gave ground and said to Socus, \"Wretch, you shall now surely\\ndie. You have stayed me from fighting further with the Trojans, but\\nyou shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory to myself, and your\\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\" \\n\\nSocus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him\\nin the back midway between the shoulders, and went right through his\\nchest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over him\\nsaying, \"O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has been\\ntoo quick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not even\\nin death shall your father and mother close your eyes, but the ravening\\nvultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their dark wings\\nand devour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans will give\\nme my due rites of burial.\" \\n\\nSo saying he drew Socus\\'s heavy spear out of his flesh and from his\\nshield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so\\nthat he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses was bleeding\\nthey raised a great shout and came on in a body towards him; he therefore\\ngave ground, and called his comrades to come and help him. Thrice\\ndid he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did brave Menelaus\\nhear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close beside him and\\nsaid, \"Ajax, noble son of Telamon, captain of your people, the cry\\nof Ulysses rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off\\nand were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let us make our way\\nthrough the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I fear he\\nmay come to harm for all his valour if he be left without support,\\nand the Danaans would miss him sorely.\" \\n\\nHe led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had gathered\\nround Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the carcase of\\nsome homed stag that has been hit with an arrow- the stag has fled\\nat full speed so long as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted,\\nbut when the arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals devour him\\nin the shady glades of the forest. Then heaven sends a fierce lion\\nthither, whereon the jackals fly in terror and the lion robs them\\nof their prey- even so did Trojans many and brave gather round crafty\\nUlysses, but the hero stood at bay and kept them off with his spear.\\nAjax then came up with his shield before him like a wall, and stood\\nhard by, whereon the Trojans fled in all directions. Menelaus took\\nUlysses by the hand, and led him out of the press while his squire\\nbrought up his chariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans and\\nkilled Doryclus, a bastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandocus,\\nLysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes rushing\\nin full flood from the mountains on to the plain, big with the rain\\nof heaven- many a dry oak and many a pine does it engulf, and much\\nmud does it bring down and cast into the sea- even so did brave Ajax\\nchase the foe furiously over the plain, slaying both men and horses.\\n\\nHector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting on\\nthe extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander,\\nwhere the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestor\\nand brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughter\\nwith his spear and furious driving, and was destroying the ranks that\\nwere opposed to him; still the Achaeans would have given no ground,\\nhad not Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen stayed the prowess of Machaon\\nshepherd of his people, by wounding him in the right shoulder with\\na triple-barbed arrow. The Achaeans were in great fear that as the\\nfight had turned against them the Trojans might take him prisoner,\\nand Idomeneus said to Nestor, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the\\nAchaean name, mount your chariot at once; take Machaon with you and\\ndrive your horses to the ships as fast as you can. A physician is\\nworth more than several other men put together, for he can cut out\\narrows and spread healing herbs.\" \\n\\nNestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at once\\nmounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician Aesculapius\\nwent with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward nothing loth\\ntowards the ships, as though of their own free will. \\n\\nThen Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from\\nhis place beside him, \"Hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme\\nwing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout,\\nthey and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before\\nhim; I know him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot\\nand horses thither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately,\\nand where the cry of battle is loudest.\" \\n\\nWith this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip\\nthey drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans, over\\nthe bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was bespattered\\nwith blood, and the rail round the car was covered with splashes both\\nfrom the horses\\' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels. Hector tore\\nhis way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and\\nhis presence threw the Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not\\nlong idle; nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword\\nand spear, and throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax son of Telamon,\\nfor Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought a better\\nman than himself. \\n\\nThen father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart of\\nAjax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind him-\\nlooking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some\\nwild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowly backwards.\\nAs peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their stockyard, and\\nwatch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick of their herd-\\nhe makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for the darts from many a\\nstrong hand fall thick around him, with burning brands that scare\\nhim for all his fury, and when morning comes he slinks foiled and\\nangry away- even so did Ajax, sorely against his will, retreat angrily\\nbefore the Trojans, fearing for the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some\\nlazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken about his back, when he\\ninto a field begins eating the corn- boys beat him but he is too many\\nfor them, and though they lay about with their sticks they cannot\\nhurt him; still when he has had his fill they at last drive him from\\nthe field- even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue great Ajax,\\never smiting the middle of his shield with their darts. Now and again\\nhe would turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions of the Trojans,\\nand then he would again retreat; but he prevented any of them from\\nmaking his way to the ships. Single-handed he stood midway between\\nthe Trojans and Achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck\\nsome of them in his mighty shield, while many, though thirsting for\\nhis blood, fell to the ground ere they could reach him to the wounding\\nof his fair flesh. \\n\\nNow when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was being\\noverpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and hurled his\\nspear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver below the midriff,\\nand laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped the armour\\nfrom his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimed an arrow\\nat him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow broke, but the\\npoint that was left in the wound dragged on the thigh; he drew back,\\ntherefore, under cover of his comrades to save his life, shouting\\nas he did so to the Danaans, \"My friends, princes and counsellors\\nof the Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who is being overpowered,\\nand I doubt whether he will come out of the fight alive. Hither, then,\\nto the rescue of great Ajax son of Telamon.\" \\n\\nEven so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came near,\\nand gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from their shoulders\\nso as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, and turned round\\nto stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men. \\n\\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the\\nmares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor out\\nof the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles\\nsaw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship watching\\nthe hard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from the ship\\nto his comrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came out looking\\nlike Mars himself- here indeed was the beginning of the ill that presently\\nbefell him. \"Why,\" said he, \"Achilles do you call me? what do you\\nwhat do you want with me?\" And Achilles answered, \"Noble son of Menoetius,\\nman after my own heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans\\npraying at my knees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroclus,\\nand ask Nestor who is that he is bearing away wounded from the field;\\nfrom his back I should say it was Machaon son of Aesculapius, but\\nI could not see his face for the horses went by me at full speed.\"\\n\\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off running\\nby the ships and tents of the Achaeans. \\n\\nWhen Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of Neleus,\\nthey dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horses from the\\nchariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside to dry the\\nsweat from their shirts, and when they had so done they came inside\\nand took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had had awarded to\\nhim from Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them a mess; she was\\ndaughter of wise Arsinous, and the Achaeans had given her to Nestor\\nbecause he excelled all of them in counsel. First she set for them\\na fair and well-made table that had feet of cyanus; on it there was\\na vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, with\\nhoney and cakes of barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship\\nwhich the old man had brought with him from home, studded with bosses\\nof gold; it had four handles, on each of which there were two golden\\ndoves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. Any one else would\\nhardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was full,\\nbut Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the woman, as fair as\\na goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat\\'s\\nmilk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in a handful of white\\nbarley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess she bade them drink\\nit. When they had done so and had thus quenched their thirst, they\\nfell talking with one another, and at this moment Patroclus appeared\\nat the door. \\n\\nWhen the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand,\\nled him into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; but\\nPatroclus stood where he was and said, \"Noble sir, I may not stay,\\nyou cannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be\\ntrifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you\\nwere bearing away from the field. I can now see for myself that he\\nis Machaon shepherd of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles.\\nYou, sir, know what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even\\nwhere no blame should lie.\" \\n\\nAnd Nestor answered, \"Why should Achilles care to know how many of\\nthe Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns\\nin our host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed\\nson of Tydeus is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus\\nhas been hit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing\\nthis man from the field- he too wounded- with an arrow; nevertheless\\nAchilles, so valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Will\\nhe wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we perish\\none upon the other? As for me, I have no strength nor stay in me any\\nlonger; would that I Were still young and strong as in the days when\\nthere was a fight between us and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding.\\nI then killed Itymoneus the valiant son of Hypeirochus a dweller in\\nElis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown my\\nhand while fighting in the front rank in defence of his cows, so he\\nfell and the country people around him were in great fear. We drove\\noff a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of cattle\\nand as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and as many\\nwide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses moreover we seized a hundred\\nand fifty, all of them mares, and many had foals running with them.\\nAll these did we drive by night to Pylus the city of Neleus, taking\\nthem within the city; and the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had\\ntaken so much, though it was the first time I had ever been in the\\nfield. At daybreak the heralds went round crying that all in Elis\\nto whom there was a debt owing should come; and the leading Pylians\\nassembled to divide the spoils. There were many to whom the Epeans\\nowed chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and had been oppressed\\nwith wrong; in former years Hercules had come, and had laid his hand\\nheavy upon us, so that all our best men had perished. Neleus had had\\ntwelve sons, but I alone was left; the others had all been killed.\\nThe Epeans presuming upon all this had looked down upon us and had\\ndone us much evil. My father chose a herd of cattle and a great flock\\nof sheep- three hundred in all- and he took their shepherds with him,\\nfor there was a great debt due to him in Elis, to wit four horses,\\nwinners of prizes. They and their chariots with them had gone to the\\ngames and were to run for a tripod, but King Augeas took them, and\\nsent back their driver grieving for the loss of his horses. Neleus\\nwas angered by what he had both said and done, and took great value\\nin return, but he divided the rest, that no man might have less than\\nhis full share. \\n\\n\"Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods throughout\\nthe city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in a body, many\\nin number, they and their chariots, in full array, and with them the\\ntwo Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads and unused\\nto fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perched upon\\na rock on the river Alpheus, the border city Pylus; this they would\\ndestroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they had crossed\\ntheir whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympus and bade\\nus set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiers in Pylos,\\nfor the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, and hid my\\nhorses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war; nevertheless\\nMinerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I was, I fought\\namong our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them. There\\nis a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene, and there\\nthey that were mounted (and I with them) waited till morning, when\\nthe companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force. Thence in\\nfull panoply and equipment we came towards noon to the sacred waters\\nof the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty Jove, with\\na bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer to Minerva.\\nAfter this we took supper in our companies, and laid us down to rest\\neach in his armour by the river. \\n\\n\"The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take\\nit, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store for\\nthem. When the sun\\'s rays began to fall upon the earth we joined battle,\\npraying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight had begun, I was\\nthe first to kill my man and take his horses- to wit the warrior Mulius.\\nHe was son-in-law to Augeas, having married his eldest daughter, golden-haired\\nAgamede, who knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the face\\nof the earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me, and when\\nhe fell headlong in the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and took my\\nplace in the front ranks. The Epeans fled in all directions when they\\nsaw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had) laid low,\\nand I swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fifty chariots-\\nand in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my spear. I should\\nhave even killed the two Moliones sons of Actor, unless their real\\nfather, Neptune lord of the earthquake, had hidden them in a thick\\nmist and borne them out of the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the\\nPylians a great victory, for we chased them far over the plain, killing\\nthe men and bringing in their armour, till we had brought our horses\\nto Buprasium rich in wheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill\\nthat is called Alision, at which point Minerva turned the people back.\\nThere I slew the last man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their\\nhorses back from Buprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among\\nthe gods, and among mortal men to Nestor. \\n\\n\"Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles is\\nfor keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue it hereafter\\nwhen the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did not Menoetius\\ncharge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon?\\nUlysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard all that he said\\nto you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits\\nthroughout all Achaea, and when we got there we found Menoetius and\\nyourself, and Achilles with you. The old knight Peleus was in the\\nouter court, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Jove the\\nlord of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which\\nhe poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. You\\ntwo were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood at\\nthe gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the hand\\ninto the house, placed us at table, and set before us such hospitable\\nentertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfied ourselves with\\nmeat and drink, I said my say and urged both of you to join us. You\\nwere ready enough to do so, and the two old men charged you much and\\nstraitly. Old Peleus bade his son Achilles fight ever among the foremost\\nand outvie his peers, while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus\\nto you: \\'My son,\\' said he, \\'Achilles is of nobler birth than you are,\\nbut you are older than he, though he is far the better man of the\\ntwo. Counsel him wisely, guide him in the right way, and he will follow\\nyou to his own profit.\\' Thus did your father charge you, but you have\\nforgotten; nevertheless, even now, say all this to Achilles if he\\nwill listen to you. Who knows but with heaven\\'s help you may talk\\nhim over, for it is good to take a friend\\'s advice. If, however, he\\nis fearful about some oracle, or if his mother has told him something\\nfrom Jove, then let him send you, and let the rest of the Myrmidons\\nfollow with you, if perchance you may bring light and saving to the\\nDanaans. And let him send you into battle clad in his own armour,\\nthat the Trojans may mistake you for him and leave off fighting; the\\nsons of the Achaeans may thus have time to get their breath, for they\\nare hard pressed and there is little breathing time in battle. You,\\nwho are fresh, might easily drive a tired enemy back to his walls\\nand away from the tents and ships.\" \\n\\nWith these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off running\\nby the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus. When he\\nhad got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was their place of assembly\\nand court of justice, with their altars dedicated to the gods, Eurypylus\\nson of Euaemon met him, wounded in the thigh with an arrow, and limping\\nout of the fight. Sweat rained from his head and shoulders, and black\\nblood welled from his cruel wound, but his mind did not wander. The\\nson of Menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon him and spoke\\npiteously saying, \"O unhappy princes and counsellors of the Danaans,\\nare you then doomed to feed the hounds of Troy with your fat, far\\nfrom your friends and your native land? say, noble Eurypylus, will\\nthe Achaeans be able to hold great Hector in check, or will they fall\\nnow before his spear?\" \\n\\nWounded Eurypylus made answer, \"Noble Patroclus, there is no hope\\nleft for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All they\\nthat were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the\\nhands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But save\\nme and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash\\nthe black blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it those\\ngracious herbs which, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles,\\nwho was himself shown them by Chiron, most righteous of all the centaurs.\\nFor of the physicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that the one\\nis lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need of healing, while\\nthe other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain.\" \\n\\n\"Hero Eurypylus,\" replied the brave son of Menoetius, \"how may these\\nthings be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble\\nAchilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even\\nso I will not be unmindful your distress.\" \\n\\nWith this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,\\nand a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground\\nfor him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp\\narrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with\\nwarm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his\\nhands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which\\nkilled all pain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left off\\nflowing. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XII\\n\\nSo the son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus within\\nthe tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately, nor\\nwere the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans in\\ncheck longer. They had built it to protect their ships, and had dug\\nthe trench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and\\nthe rich spoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs\\nto the gods. It had been built without the consent of the immortals,\\nand therefore it did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achilles\\nnursed his anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken,\\nthe great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of\\nthe Trojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some\\nwere yet left alive when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenth\\nyear, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to their own\\ncountry- then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall,\\nand they turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount\\nIda into the sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus,\\nAesopus, and goodly Scamander, with Simois, where many a shield and\\nhelm had fallen, and many a hero of the race of demigods had bitten\\nthe dust. Phoebus Apollo turned the mouths of all these rivers together\\nand made them flow for nine days against the wall, while Jove rained\\nthe whole time that he might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune\\nhimself, trident in hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea\\nall the foundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid\\nwith so much toil; he made all level by the mighty stream of the Hellespont,\\nand then when he had swept the wall away he spread a great beach of\\nsand over the place where it had been. This done he turned the rivers\\nback into their old courses. \\n\\nThis was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but as\\nyet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its timbers\\nrang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowed by\\nthe scourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear of Hector\\nthe mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought with the force\\nand fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turns fiercely on\\nthe dogs and men that attack him, while these form solid wall and\\nshower their javelins as they face him- his courage is all undaunted,\\nbut his high spirit will be the death of him; many a time does he\\ncharge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall back as often\\nas he does so- even so did Hector go about among the host exhorting\\nhis men, and cheering them on to cross the trench. \\n\\nBut the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink,\\nfor the width frightened them. They could neither jump it nor cross\\nit, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above\\nwhich there were the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans had\\nplanted so close and strong as a defence against all who would assail\\nit; a horse, therefore, could not get into it and draw his chariot\\nafter him, but those who were on foot kept trying their very utmost.\\nThen Polydamas went up to Hector and said, \"Hector, and you other\\ncaptains of the Trojans and allies, it is madness for us to try and\\ndrive our horses across the trench; it will be very hard to cross,\\nfor it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall.\\nOur horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no use\\nif they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to harm.\\nIf, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in his anger\\nwill utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly see them\\nperish now and here far from Argos; but if they should rally and we\\nare driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench there will\\nbe not so much as a man get back to the city to tell the tale. Now,\\ntherefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires hold our horses\\nby the trench, but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, clad in\\nfull armour, and if the day of their doom is at hand the Achaeans\\nwill not be able to withstand us.\" \\n\\nThus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang in\\nfull armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they saw\\nhim do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horses\\nover to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at the\\ntrench. Then they formed themselves into companies, made themselves\\nready, and in five bodies followed their leaders. Those that went\\nwith Hector and Polydamas were the bravest and most in number, and\\nthe most determined to break through the wall and fight at the ships.\\nCebriones was also joined with them as third in command, for Hector\\nhad left his chariot in charge of a less valiant soldier. The next\\ncompany was led by Paris, Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus\\nand Deiphobus, two sons of Priam, and with them was the hero Asius-\\nAsius the son of Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breed that\\ncomes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas the\\nvaliant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sons of Antenor,\\nArchelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts of war. Sarpedon\\nwas captain over the allies, and took with him Glaucus and Asteropaeus\\nwhom he deemed most valiant after himself- for he was far the best\\nman of them all. These helped to array one another in their ox-hide\\nshields, and then charged straight at the Danaans, for they felt sure\\nthat they would not hold out longer and that they should themselves\\nnow fall upon the ships. \\n\\nThe rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel\\nof Polydamas but Asius son of Hyrtacus would not leave his horses\\nand his esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with\\nhim towards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end in consequence.\\nNevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exulting in his chariot\\nand his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened name had overshadowed\\nhim and he had fallen by the spear of Idomeneus the noble son of Deucalion.\\nHe had driven towards the left wing of the ships, by which way the\\nAchaeans used to return with their chariots and horses from the plain.\\nHither he drove and found the gates with their doors opened wide,\\nand the great bar down- for the gatemen kept them open so as to let\\nthose of their comrades enter who might be flying towards the ships.\\nHither of set purpose did he direct his horses, and his men followed\\nhim with a loud cry, for they felt sure that the Achaeans would not\\nhold out longer, and that they should now fall upon the ships. Little\\ndid they know that at the gates they should find two of the bravest\\nchieftains, proud sons of the fighting Lapithae- the one, Polypoetes,\\nmighty son of Pirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous\\nMars. These stood before the gates like two high oak trees upon the\\nmountains, that tower from their wide-spreading roots, and year after\\nyear battle with wind and rain- even so did these two men await the\\nonset of great Asius confidently and without flinching. The Trojans\\nled by him and by Iamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius, Thoon\\nand Oenomaus, raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the\\nwall, holding their shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for\\na while the two defenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans\\non to stand firm in the defence of their ships; when, however, they\\nsaw that the Trojans were attacking the wall, while the Danaans were\\ncrying out for help and being routed, they rushed outside and fought\\nin front of the gates like two wild boars upon the mountains that\\nabide the attack of men and dogs, and charging on either side break\\ndown the wood all round them tearing it up by the roots, and one can\\nhear the clattering of their tusks, till some one hits them and makes\\nan end of them- even so did the gleaming bronze rattle about their\\nbreasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they fought with great\\nfury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were on the wall\\nabove them. These threw great stones at their assailants in defence\\nof themselves their tents and their ships. The stones fell thick as\\nthe flakes of snow which some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds\\nand showers down in sheets upon the earth- even so fell the weapons\\nfrom the hands alike of Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang\\nout as the great stones rained upon them, and Asius the son of Hyrtacus\\nin his dismay cried aloud and smote his two thighs. \"Father Jove,\"\\nhe cried, \"of a truth you too are altogether given to lying. I made\\nsure the Argive heroes could not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted\\nwasps, or bees that have their nests in the rocks by the wayside-\\nthey leave not the holes wherein they have built undefended, but fight\\nfor their little ones against all who would take them- even so these\\nmen, though they be but two, will not be driven from the gates, but\\nstand firm either to slay or be slain.\" \\n\\nHe spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then was\\nto give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans were fighting\\nabout the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able to tell about\\nall these things, for the battle raged everywhere about the stone\\nwall as it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited though they\\nwere, were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods who were\\ndefending the Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithae kept\\non fighting with might and main. \\n\\nThereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a spear\\nupon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him, for\\nthe point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so that\\nthe brain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. He then\\nslew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killed Hippomachus\\nthe son of Antimachus by striking him with his spear upon the girdle.\\nHe then drew his sword and sprang first upon Antiphates whom he killed\\nin combat, and who fell face upwards on the earth. After him he killed\\nMenon, Iamenus, and Orestes, and laid them low one after the other.\\n\\nWhile they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the youths\\nwho were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were the greater\\npart and the most valiant of those that were trying to break through\\nthe wall and fire the ships) were still standing by the trench, uncertain\\nwhat they should do; for they had seen a sign from heaven when they\\nhad essayed to cross it- a soaring eagle that flew skirting the left\\nwing of their host, with a monstrous blood-red snake in its talons\\nstill alive and struggling to escape. The snake was still bent on\\nrevenge, wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it struck the\\nbird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird being\\nin pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host, and\\nthen flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were struck\\nwith terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing Jove,\\nwrithing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hector and\\nsaid, \"Hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke\\nme, even when I speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth,\\nthat one of the people should cross your will either in the field\\nor at the council board; you would have them support you always: nevertheless\\nI will say what I think will be best; let us not now go on to fight\\nthe Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen if this soaring\\neagle which skirted the left wing of our with a monstrous blood-red\\nsnake in its talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent\\nas an omen to the Trojans on their essaying to cross the trench. The\\neagle let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking it home to her\\nlittle ones, and so will it be- with ourselves; even though by a mighty\\neffort we break through the gates and wall of the Achaeans, and they\\ngive way before us, still we shall not return in good order by the\\nway we came, but shall leave many a man behind us whom the Achaeans\\nwill do to death in defence of their ships. Thus would any seer who\\nwas expert in these matters, and was trusted by the people, read the\\nportent.\" \\n\\nHector looked fiercely at him and said, \"Polydamas, I like not of\\nyour reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will.\\nIf, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven\\nrobbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to the counsels\\nof Jove, nor to the promises he made me- and he bowed his head in\\nconfirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild-fowl.\\nWhat care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark, and whether they\\nbe on my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trust rather in\\nthe counsel of great Jove, king of mortals and immortals. There is\\none omen, and one only- that a man should fight for his country. Why\\nare you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at the ships of the\\nArgives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for you are not\\nsteadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or would talk others\\nover from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before my spear.\"\\n\\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after with\\na cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent the blast\\nof a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dust down\\ntowards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into security, and\\ngave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to their\\nown might and to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break through\\nthe great wall of the Achaeans. They tore down the breastworks from\\nthe walls, and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved the buttresses,\\nwhich the Achaeans had set in front of the wall in order to support\\nit; when they had pulled these down they made sure of breaking through\\nthe wall, but the Danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they\\nstill fenced the battlements with their shields of ox-hide, and hurled\\ntheir missiles down upon the foe as soon as any came below the wall.\\n\\nThe two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the\\nAchaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to any\\none whom they saw to be remiss. \"My friends,\" they cried, \"Argives\\none and all- good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet,\\nin which all were of equal prowess- there is now work enough, as you\\nvery well know, for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flight\\ntowards the ships, daunted by the shouting of the foe, but press forward\\nand keep one another in heart, if it may so be that Olympian Jove\\nthe lord of lightning will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive\\nthem back towards the city.\" \\n\\nThus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on. As\\nthe flakes that fall thick upon a winter\\'s day, when Jove is minded\\nto snow and to display these his arrows to mankind- he lulls the wind\\nto rest, and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops of\\nthe high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy\\nplains, and the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the\\nforelands, and havens of the grey sea, but the waves as they come\\nrolling in stay it that it can come no further, though all else is\\nwrapped as with a mantle so heavy are the heavens with snow- even\\nthus thickly did the stones fall on one side and on the other, some\\nthrown at the Trojans, and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and\\nthe whole wall was in an uproar. \\n\\nStill the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down\\nthe gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedon\\nagainst the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle. Before\\nhim he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith had beaten\\nso fair and round, and had lined with ox hides which he had made fast\\nwith rivets of gold all round the shield; this he held in front of\\nhim, and brandishing his two spears came on like some lion of the\\nwilderness, who has been long famished for want of meat and will dare\\nbreak even into a well-fenced homestead to try and get at the sheep.\\nHe may find the shepherds keeping watch over their flocks with dogs\\nand spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from the fold till he\\nhas had a try for it; he will either spring on a sheep and carry it\\noff, or be hit by a spear from strong hand- even so was Sarpedon fain\\nto attack the wall and break down its battlements. Then he said to\\nGlaucus son of Hippolochus, \"Glaucus, why in Lycia do we receive especial\\nhonour as regards our place at table? Why are the choicest portions\\nserved us and our cups kept brimming, and why do men look up to us\\nas though we were gods? Moreover we hold a large estate by the banks\\nof the river Xanthus, fair with orchard lawns and wheat-growing land;\\nit becomes us, therefore, to take our stand at the head of all the\\nLycians and bear the brunt of the fight, that one may say to another,\\nOur princes in Lycia eat the fat of the land and drink best of wine,\\nbut they are fine fellows; they fight well and are ever at the front\\nin battle.\\' My good friend, if, when we were once out of this fight,\\nwe could escape old age and death thenceforward and for ever, I should\\nneither press forward myself nor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand\\nshapes hangs ever over our heads, and no man can elude him; therefore\\nlet us go forward and either win glory for ourselves, or yield it\\nto another.\" \\n\\nGlaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host\\nof Lycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them,\\nfor it was against his part of the wall that they came- bringing destruction\\nwith them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain to support\\nhis comrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for the fray,\\nand Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them; but\\nhe could not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great an\\nuproar was there from crashing shields and helmets and the battering\\nof gates with a din which reached the skies. For all the gates had\\nbeen closed, and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and break\\ntheir way through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with a\\nmessage to Ajax. \"Run, good Thootes,\" said and call Ajax, or better\\nstill bid both come, for it will be all over with us here directly;\\nthe leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever fought desperately\\nheretofore. But if the have too much on their hands to let them come,\\nat any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous\\nbowman come with him.\" \\n\\nThe messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wall\\nof the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, \"Sirs,\\nprinces of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to him\\nfor a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or\\nit will be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians\\nare upon him, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if\\nyou have too much on your hands to let both come, at any rate let\\nAjax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with\\nhim.\" \\n\\nGreat Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, and at once spoke\\nto the son of Oileus. \"Ajax,\" said he, \"do you two, yourself and brave\\nLycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight their\\nhardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but\\nI will come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help\\nthey need.\" \\n\\nWith this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer his brother by\\nthe same father went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer\\'s bow. They\\nwent along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where\\nMenestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave\\ncaptains and leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements\\nas it were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising\\nthe battle-cry aloud. \\n\\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of Sarpedon,\\nhitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the battlements at the\\nvery top of the wall. As men now are, even one who is in the bloom\\nof youth could hardly lift it with his two hands, but Ajax raised\\nit high aloft and flung it down, smashing Epicles\\' four-crested helmet\\nso that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell\\nfrom the high wall as though he were diving, with no more life left\\nin him. Then Teucer wounded Glaucus the brave son of Hippolochus as\\nhe was coming on to attack the wall. He saw his shoulder bare and\\naimed an arrow at it, which made Glaucus leave off fighting. Thereon\\nhe sprang covertly down for fear some of the Achaeans might see that\\nhe was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was stung with grief when he\\nsaw Glaucus leave him, still he did not leave off fighting, but aimed\\nhis spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor and hit him. He drew his spear\\nback again Alcmaon came down headlong after it with his bronzed armour\\nrattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized the battlement in his strong\\nhands, and tugged at it till it an gave way together, and a breach\\nwas made through which many might pass. \\n\\nAjax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him with\\nan arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body,\\nbut Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not fall by\\nthe ships\\' sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced his shield,\\nbut the spear did not go clean through, though it hustled him back\\nthat he could come on no further. He therefore retired a little space\\nfrom the battlement, yet without losing all his ground, for he still\\nthought to cover himself with glory. Then he turned round and shouted\\nto the brave Lycians saying, \"Lycians, why do you thus fail me? For\\nall my prowess I cannot break through the wall and open a way to the\\nships single-handed. Come close on behind me, for the more there are\\nof us the better.\" \\n\\nThe Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who was\\ntheir counsellor their king. The Argives on their part got their men\\nin fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly struggle\\nbetween them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and force\\ntheir way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians from\\nthe wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods\\nin hand, quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own in\\ncommon, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a mere\\nstrip, even so did the battlements now serve as a bone of contention,\\nand they beat one another\\'s round shields for their possession. Many\\na man\\'s body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round\\nand bared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean through\\ntheir shields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged with\\nthe blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans. But even so the Trojans\\ncould not rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as some honest\\nhard-working woman weighs wool in her balance and sees that the scales\\nbe true, for she would gain some pitiful earnings for her little ones,\\neven so was the fight balanced evenly between them till the time came\\nwhen Jove gave the greater glory to Hector son of Priam, who was first\\nto spring towards the wall of the Achaeans. As he did so, he cried\\naloud to the Trojans, \"Up, Trojans, break the wall of the Argives,\\nand fling fire upon their ships.\" \\n\\nThus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at\\nthe wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements with sharp\\nspears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay just outside\\nthe gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other; two of\\nthe best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise it from\\nthe ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted it quite easily\\nby himself, for the son of scheming Saturn made it light for him.\\nAs a shepherd picks up a ram\\'s fleece with one hand and finds it no\\nburden, so easily did Hector lift the great stone and drive it right\\nat the doors that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set. These\\ndoors were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars\\nto which there was but one key. When he had got close up to them,\\nHector strode towards them that his blow might gain in force and struck\\nthem in the middle, leaning his whole weight against them. He broke\\nboth hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its great weight.\\nThe portals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, and\\nthe doors flew open, one one way, and the other the other, through\\nthe force of the blow. Then brave Hector leaped inside with a face\\nas dark as that of flying night. The gleaming bronze flashed fiercely\\nabout his body and he had tow spears in his hand. None but a god could\\nhave withstood him as he flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes\\nglared like fire. Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called\\non them to scale the wall, and they did as he bade them- some of them\\nat once climbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates.\\nThe Danaans then fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all\\nwas uproar and confusion. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XIII\\n\\nNow when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the ships,\\nhe left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keen eyes\\naway, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace, the\\nMysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, who live\\non milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind. He no longer turned so\\nmuch as a glance towards Troy, for he did not think that any of the\\nimmortals would go and help either Trojans or Danaans. \\n\\nBut King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking admiringly\\non the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of wooded Samothrace,\\nwhence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and the ships\\nof the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and taken his place\\nhere, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcome by the Trojans;\\nand he was furiously angry with Jove. \\n\\nPresently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as he\\nstrode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath\\nthe tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the\\nfourth he reached his goal- Aegae, where is his glittering golden\\npalace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there,\\nhe yoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all\\nflying in the wind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped\\nhis gold whip, and took his stand upon his chariot. As he went his\\nway over the waves the sea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew\\ntheir lord, and came gambolling round him from every quarter of the\\ndeep, while the sea in her gladness opened a path before his chariot.\\nSo lightly did the horses fly that the bronze axle of the car was\\nnot even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him to\\nthe ships of the Achaeans. \\n\\nNow there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway\\nbetween Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the earthquake\\nstayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosial\\nforage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold which none could\\neither unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place\\nuntil their lord should return. This done he went his way to the host\\nof the Achaeans. \\n\\nNow the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like a\\nstorm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising\\nthe cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of\\nthe Achaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there. Meanwhile\\nearth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on the Argives,\\nfor he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice\\nof Calchas. \\n\\nFirst he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,\\nand said, \"Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if you\\nwill put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted.\\nI am not afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force,\\nwill be victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all\\nof them in check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here\\nwhere furious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself,\\nis leading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put\\nit into your hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others\\nto do the like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even\\nthough he be inspired by Jove himself.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck both\\nof them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring. He made\\ntheir legs light and active, as also their hands and their feet. Then,\\nas the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some sheer rock,\\nand presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even\\nso did Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air\\nand leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first\\nto know who it was that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax\\nson of Telamon, \"Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus,\\nwho in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by our\\nships. It was not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knew him\\nat once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods are\\nsoon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn more fiercely\\nwithin me, while my hands and my feet under me are more eager for\\nthe fray.\" \\n\\nAnd Ajax son of Telamon answered, \"I too feel my hands grasp my spear\\nmore firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble; I long,\\nmoreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even in single combat.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with which\\nthe god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler roused the\\nAchaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at once\\nby hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans had got over\\nthe wall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes as they beheld\\nthem, for they made sure that they should not escape destruction;\\nbut the lord of the earthquake passed lightly about among them and\\nurged their battalions to the front. \\n\\nFirst he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and Thoas\\nand Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors; all\\ndid he exhort. \"Shame on you young Argives,\" he cried, \"it was on\\nyour prowess I relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not\\nwith might and main, this very day will see us overcome by the Trojans.\\nOf a truth my eyes behold a great and terrible portent which I had\\nnever thought to see- the Trojans at our ships- they, who were heretofore\\nlike panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest,\\nwith no strength but in flight for they cannot defend themselves.\\nHitherto the Trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of the\\nAchaeans, but now they have sallied far from their city and are fighting\\nat our very ships through the cowardice of our leader and the disaffection\\nof the people themselves, who in their discontent care not to fight\\nin defence of the ships but are being slaughtered near them. True,\\nKing Agamemnon son of Atreus is the cause of our disaster by having\\ninsulted the son of Peleus, still this is no reason why we should\\nleave off fighting. Let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the\\nbrave heal quickly. You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the\\nfinest soldiers in our whole army. I blame no man for keeping out\\nof battle if he is a weakling, but I am indignant with such men as\\nyou are. My good friends, matters will soon become even worse through\\nthis slackness; think, each one of you, of his own honour and credit,\\nfor the hazard of the fight is extreme. Great Hector is now fighting\\nat our ships; he has broken through the gates and the strong bolt\\nthat held them.\" \\n\\nThus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them on.\\nThereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men, of\\nwhom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could make light\\nif they went among them, for they were the picked men of all those\\nwho were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans. They made\\na living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to buckler,\\nhelmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests on their gleaming\\nhelmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closely seffied\\nwere they; the spears they brandished in their strong hands were interlaced,\\nand their hearts were set on battle. \\n\\nThe Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head pressing\\nright on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of some mountain\\nfrom whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the foundations\\nof the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, and as it\\nbounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an uproar;\\nit swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches level ground,\\nbut then for all its fury it can go no further- even so easily did\\nHector for a while seem as though he would career through the tents\\nand ships of the Achaeans till he had reached the sea in his murderous\\ncourse; but the closely serried battalions stayed him when he reached\\nthem, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears\\npointed at both ends, and drove him from them so that he staggered\\nand gave ground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, \"Trojans, Lycians,\\nand Dardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans\\nhave set themselves as a wall against me, but they will not check\\nme for long; they will give ground before me if the mightiest of the\\ngods, the thundering spouse of Juno, has indeed inspired my onset.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus son\\nof Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with his\\nround shield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly forward.\\nMeriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit the\\nbroad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the spear\\nbroke in two pieces long ere he could do so; moreover Deiphobus had\\nseen it coming and had held his shield well away from him. Meriones\\ndrew back under cover of his comrades, angry alike at having failed\\nto vanquish Deiphobus, and having broken his spear. He turned therefore\\ntowards the ships and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind\\nin his tent. \\n\\nThe others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into\\nthe heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man,\\nto wit, the warrior Imbrius son of Mentor rich in horses. Until the\\nAchaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste\\na bastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet\\nhe had gone back to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans,\\ndwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like honour with his own\\nsons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spear\\nwhich he then drew back again, and Imbrius fell headlong as an ash-tree\\nwhen it is felled on the crest of some high mountain beacon, and its\\ndelicate green foliage comes toppling down to the ground. Thus did\\nhe fall with his bronze-dight armour ringing harshly round him, and\\nTeucer sprang forward with intent to strip him of his armour; but\\nas he was doing so, Hector took aim at him with a spear. Teucer saw\\nthe spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit Amphimachus, son\\nof Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he was coming into battle,\\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\\nHector sprang forward to take Amphimachus\\'s helmet from off his temples,\\nand in a moment Ajax threw a spear at him, but did not wound him,\\nfor he was encased all over in his terrible armour; nevertheless the\\nspear struck the boss of his shield with such force as to drive him\\nback from the two corpses, which the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius\\nand Menestheus, captains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to\\nthe host of the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes\\ndid the like by Imbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds\\nthat have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high\\nabove the ground in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the\\nbody of Imbrius, and strip it of its armour. Then the son of Oileus\\nsevered the head from the neck in revenge for the death of Amphimachus,\\nand sent it whirling over the crowd as though it had been a ball,\\ntill fell in the dust at Hector\\'s feet. \\n\\nNeptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus should\\nhave fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of the Achaeans\\nto urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for the Trojans.\\nIdomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who had just\\ncome to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. His fellow-soldiers\\nbore him off the field, and Idomeneus having given orders to the physicians\\nwent on to his tent, for he was still thirsting for battle. Neptune\\nspoke in the likeness and with the voice of Thoas son of Andraemon\\nwho ruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron and high Calydon, and was honoured\\namong his people as though he were a god. \"Idomeneus,\" said he, \"lawgiver\\nto the Cretans, what has now become of the threats with which the\\nsons of the Achaeans used to threaten the Trojans?\" \\n\\nAnd Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, \"Thoas, no one, so\\nfar as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held back\\nneither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the of almighty\\nJove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos:\\nyou, Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart\\nif you see any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all\\nto do their utmost.\" \\n\\nTo this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, \"Idomeneus, may\\nhe never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten upon,\\nwho is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour and go,\\nwe must make all haste together if we may be of any use, though we\\nare only two. Even cowards gain courage from companionship, and we\\ntwo can hold our own with the bravest.\" \\n\\nTherewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and Idomeneus\\nwhen he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped his two spears,\\nand sallied forth. As the lightning which the son of Saturn brandishes\\nfrom bright Olympus when he would show a sign to mortals, and its\\ngleam flashes far and wide- even so did his armour gleam about him\\nas he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire met him while he was still near\\nhis tent (for he was going to fetch his spear) and Idomeneus said\\n\\n\"Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you left\\nthe field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting\\nyou? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I had\\nfar rather fight than stay in my tent.\" \\n\\n\"Idomeneus,\" answered Meriones, \"I come for a spear, if I can find\\none in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at the\\nshield of Deiphobus.\" \\n\\nAnd Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, \"You will find one\\nspear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall\\nof my tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for\\nI am not one to keep my enemy at arm\\'s length; therefore I have spears,\\nbossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets.\" \\n\\nThen Meriones said, \"I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils taken\\nfrom the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at all times\\nvalorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my own\\namong the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who do not\\nknow how I fight, but you know it well enough yourself.\"\\n\\nIdomeneus answered, \"I know you for a brave man: you need not tell\\nme. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush-\\nand there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of;\\nit comes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change\\ncolour at every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keeps shifting\\nhis weight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart beats\\nfast as he thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of his\\nteeth; whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be on finding\\nhimself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go into action-\\nif the best men were being chosen for such a service, no one could\\nmake light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck by\\na dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind, in\\nyour neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or belly\\nas you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks. But let\\nus no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill spoken\\nof; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once.\" \\n\\nOn this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself a\\nspear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with great\\ndeeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and\\nhis son Panic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror\\neven into the heart of a hero- the pair have gone from Thrace to arm\\nthemselves among the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they will\\nnot listen to both the contending hosts, and will give victory to\\none side or to the other- even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captains\\nof men, go out to battle clad in their bronze armour. Meriones was\\nfirst to speak. \"Son of Deucalion,\" said he, \"where would you have\\nus begin fighting? On the right wing of the host, in the centre, or\\non the left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?\"\\n\\nIdomeneus answered, \"There are others to defend the centre- the two\\nAjaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans, and\\nis good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector son of\\nPriam enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to vanquish\\ntheir indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of Saturn\\nfling a firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon\\nwill yield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats the grain of\\nCeres, if bronze and great stones can overthrow him. He would not\\nyield even to Achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of\\nfoot there is none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards the\\nleft wing, that we may know forthwith whether we are to give glory\\nto some other, or he to us.\" \\n\\nMeriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to the\\npart of the host which Idomeneus had named. \\n\\nNow when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire,\\nhim and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shouted\\nand made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight\\nraged under the ships\\' sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle\\nupon a day when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it\\ninto a thick cloud- even such was the fury of the combat, and might\\nand main did they hack at each other with spear and sword throughout\\nthe host. The field bristled with the long and deadly spears which\\nthey bore. Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their\\nfresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they joined\\nbattle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage who could\\ntake pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look on it without\\nbeing dismayed. \\n\\nThus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal heroes.\\nJove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to Hector, so as\\nto do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did not mean to utterly\\noverthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, and only wanted to glorify\\nThetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the other hand went about among\\nthe Argives to incite them, having come up from the grey sea in secret,\\nfor he was grieved at seeing them vanquished by the Trojans, and was\\nfuriously angry with Jove. Both were of the same race and country,\\nbut Jove was elder born and knew more, therefore Neptune feared to\\ndefend the Argives openly, but in the likeness of man, he kept on\\nencouraging them throughout their host. Thus, then, did these two\\ndevise a knot of war and battle, that none could unloose or break,\\nand set both sides tugging at it, to the failing of men\\'s knees beneath\\nthem. \\n\\nAnd now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,\\ncalled loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as he\\nleaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner,\\nwho had but lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandra\\nthe fairest of Priam\\'s daughters in marriage, but offered no gifts\\nof wooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he would drive\\nthe sons of the Achaeans willy nilly from Troy; old King Priam had\\ngiven his consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on the\\nstrength of the promises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed a spear,\\nand hit him as he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze did not\\nprotect him, and the spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily\\nto the ground. Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying, \"Othryoneus,\\nthere is no one in the world whom I shall admire more than I do you,\\nif you indeed perform what you have promised Priam son of Dardanus\\nin return for his daughter. We too will make you an offer; we will\\ngive you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus, and will bring\\nher from Argos for you to marry, if you will sack the goodly city\\nof Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along with me, that we\\nmay make a covenant at the ships about the marriage, and we will not\\nbe hard upon you about gifts of wooing.\" \\n\\nWith this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick\\nof the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in front\\nof his horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he\\ncould feel their \\'breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike\\ndown Idomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with his\\nspear in the throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean\\nthrough it. He fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrights\\nhave felled for ship\\'s timber upon the mountains with whetted axes-\\neven thus did he lie full length in front of his chariot and horses,\\ngrinding his teeth and clutching at the bloodstained just. His charioteer\\nwas struck with panic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape:\\nthereupon Antilochus hit him in the middle of his body with a spear;\\nhis cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the spear stuck in\\nhis belly. He fell gasping from his chariot and Antilochus great Nestor\\'s\\nson, drove his horses from the Trojans to the Achaeans. \\n\\nDeiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and took\\naim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided\\nit, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore- a shield\\nof oxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He crouched\\nunder cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the shield rang\\nout as the spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in vain from the\\nstrong hand of Deiphobus, for it struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus,\\nshepherd of his people, in the liver under the midriff, and his limbs\\nfailed beneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud\\nvoice saying, \"Of a truth Asius has not fallen unavenied; he will\\nbe glad even while passing into the house of Hades, strong warden\\nof the gate, that I have sent some one to escort him.\" \\n\\nThus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. Noble\\nAntilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him\\nforget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and\\ncovered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades, Mecisteus\\nson of Echius, and Alastor stooped down, and bore him away groaning\\nheavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He kept on\\nstriving continually either to enshroud some Trojan in the darkness\\nof death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil day from the\\nAchaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes: he was son-in-law\\nto Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia who was\\nthe darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her generation\\nin beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore the bravest\\nman in all Troy had taken her to wife- him did Neptune lay low by\\nthe hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding his strong\\nlimbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one side,\\nbut stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck\\nhim with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mail that\\nhad hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly as\\nthe spear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground, and the\\nspear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end\\nof the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life. Idomeneus\\nvaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, \"Deiphobus, since\\nyou are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killed\\nthree men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself,\\nthat you may learn what manner of Jove-begotten man am I that have\\ncome hither. Jove first begot Minos chief ruler in Crete, and Minos\\nin his turn begot a son, noble Deucalion; Deucalion begot me to be\\na ruler over many men in Crete, and my ships have now brought me hither,\\nto be the bane of yourself, your father, and the Trojans.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go back\\nand fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the challenge\\nsingle-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch Aeneas,\\nwhom he found standing in the rear, for he had long been aggrieved\\nwith Priam because in spite his brave deeds he did not give him his\\ndue share of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said, \"Aeneas, prince\\namong the Trojans, if you know any ties of kinship, help me now to\\ndefend the body of your sister\\'s husband; come with me to the rescue\\nof Alcathous, who being husband to your sister brought you up when\\nyou were a child in his house, and now Idomeneus has slain him.\"\\n\\nWith these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in pursuit\\nof Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneus was not\\nto be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his ground\\nas a wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming of\\na great crowd of men in some lonely place- the bristles stand upright\\non his back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness\\nto defend himself against hounds and men- even so did famed Idomeneus\\nhold his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud\\nto his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus, Deipyrus, Meriones,\\nand Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers- \"Hither my friends,\" he\\ncried, \"and leave me not single-handed- I go in great fear by fleet\\nAeneas, who is coming against me, and is a redoubtable dispenser of\\ndeath battle. Moreover he is in the flower of youth when a man\\'s strength\\nis greatest; if I was of the same age as he is and in my present mind,\\neither he or I should soon bear away the prize of victory\\n\\nOn this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on shoulder.\\nAeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking towards Deiphobus,\\nParis, and Agenor, who were leaders of the Trojans along with himself,\\nand the people followed them as sheep follow the ram when they go\\ndown to drink after they have been feeding, and the heart of the shepherd\\nis glad- even so was the heart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his\\npeople follow him. \\n\\nThen they fought furiously in close combat about the body of Alcathous,\\nwielding their long spears; and the bronze armour about their bodies\\nrang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the press of the\\nfight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers of Mars, outxied\\nevery one in their desire to hack at each other with sword and spear.\\nAeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was on the lookout and avoided\\nthe spear, so that it sped from Aeneas\\' strong hand in vain, and fell\\nquivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oenomaus in the\\nmiddle of his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereon his\\nbowels came gushing out and he clutched the earth in the palms of\\nhis hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus drew his spear\\nout of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his armour\\nfor the rain of darts that were showered upon him: moreover his strength\\nwas now beginning to fail him so that he could no longer charge, and\\ncould neither spring forward to recover his own weapon nor swerve\\naside to avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore, though he still\\ndefended himself in hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear\\nhim swiftly out of the battle. Deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he\\nwas retreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him\\nwas as fierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit Ascalaphus,\\nthe son of Mars; the spear went through his shoulder, and he clutched\\nthe earth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.\\n\\nGrim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen,\\nfor he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the golden clouds,\\nby command of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting, forbidden\\nto take part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously about the\\nbody. Deiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, but Meriones sprang\\nupon him, and struck him on the arm with a spear so that the visored\\nhelmet fell from his hand and came ringing down upon the ground. Thereon\\nMeriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from his shoulder,\\nand fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites, own brother of\\nDeiphobus passed his arms around his waist, and bore him away from\\nthe battle till he got to his horses that were standing in the rear\\nof the fight with the chariot and their driver. These took him towards\\nthe city groaning and in great pain, with the blood flowing from his\\narm. \\n\\nThe others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven without\\nceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and struck him\\nwith a spear in his throat which was turned towards him; his head\\nfell on one side, his helmet and shield came down along with him,\\nand death, life\\'s foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied his chance,\\nflew forward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round.\\nHe laid open the vein that runs all the way up the back to the neck;\\nhe cut this vein clean away throughout its whole course, and Thoon\\nfell in the dust face upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly\\ntowards his comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the\\narmour from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so.\\nThe Trojans came about him on every side and struck his broad and\\ngleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptune stood guard\\nover the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thickly round him. He\\nwas never clear of the foe, but was always in the thick of the fight;\\nhis spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it in every direction,\\nso eager was he to hit some one from a distance or to fight him hand\\nto hand. \\n\\nAs he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas son of\\nAsius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the middle\\nof his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, for he grudged\\nhim the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of the spear stuck\\nfast like a charred stake in Antilochus\\'s shield, while the other\\nlay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men,\\nbut Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway between\\nthe private parts and the navel, where a wound is particualrly painful\\nto wretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed\\nconvulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen have\\nbound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce. Even so did\\nhe move convulsively for a while, but not for very long, till Meriones\\ncame up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyes were veiled\\nin darkness. \\n\\nHelenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting\\nhim on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his\\nhead; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were fighting\\non the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his feet, but\\nthe eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.\\n\\nOn this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,\\nbrandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the two attacked\\none another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and\\nthe other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit the breastplate\\nof Menelaus\\'s corslet, but the arrow glanced from off it. As black\\nbeans or pulse come pattering down on to a threshing-floor from the\\nbroad winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill winds and shaken by the shovel-\\neven so did the arrow glance off and recoil from the shield of Menelaus,\\nwho in his turn wounded the hand with which Helenus carried his bow;\\nthe spear went right through his hand and stuck in the bow itself,\\nso that to his life he retreated under cover of his men, with his\\nhand dragging by his side- for the spear weighed it down till Agenor\\ndrew it out and bound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which\\nhis esquire had with him. \\n\\nPisander then made straight at Menelaus- his evil destiny luring him\\non to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus.\\nWhen the two were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus\\nturned aside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield\\nof brave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the\\nspear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure\\nof victory; forthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword and\\nsprang upon him. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with\\nits long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under\\nhis shield, and the two made at one another. Pisander struck the peak\\nof Menelaus\\'s crested helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaus\\nhit Pisander as he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at\\nthe rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled\\neyes fell by his feet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground,\\nand Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and\\nvaunted over him saying, \"Even thus shall you Trojans leave the ships\\nof the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle though you be: nor\\nshall you lack any of the disgrace and shame which you have heaped\\nupon myself. Cowardly she-wolves that you are, you feared not the\\nanger of dread Jove, avenger of violated hospitality, who will one\\nday destroy your city; you stole my wedded wife and wickedly carried\\noff much treasure when you were her guest, and now you would fling\\nfire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. A day will come when, rage\\nas you may, you shall be stayed. O father Jove, you, who they say\\nart above all both gods and men in wisdom, and from whom all things\\nthat befall us do proceed, how can you thus favour the Trojans- men\\nso proud and overweening, that they are never tired of fighting? All\\nthings pall after a while- sleep, love, sweet song, and stately dance-\\nstill these are things of which a man would surely have his fill rather\\nthan of battle, whereas it is of battle that the Trojans are insatiate.\"\\n\\nSo saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body\\nof Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged himself\\namong those who were in the front of the fight. \\n\\nHarpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come\\nto fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go home again.\\nHe struck the middle of Menelaus\\'s shield with his spear but could\\nnot pierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of his men,\\nlooking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. But Meriones\\naimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the field, and\\nhit him on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through and\\nthrough, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and\\nbreathed his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm\\nupon the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed\\nfrom his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care;\\nthey raised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city\\nof Troy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but there\\nwas no ransom that could bring his dead son to life again.\\n\\nParis was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host\\nwhen he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore,\\nin order to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor,\\nson of Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was\\nin Corinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that\\nit would be the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus had\\noften told him that he must either stay at home and die of a terrible\\ndisease, or go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans;\\nhe chose, therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans\\nwould have laid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain\\nand suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on the jaw under his\\near, whereon the life went out of him and he was enshrouded in the\\ndarkness of death. \\n\\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector had\\nnot yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havoc\\nof his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere\\nlong would have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer\\nthem on and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he\\nhad first forced his way through the gates and the wall, after breaking\\nthrough the serried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the\\nships of Ajax and Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here\\nthe wall was at its lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged\\nmost fiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics,\\nthe Locrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans\\ncould hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could\\nthey drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The chosen\\nmen of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus son of Peteos,\\nwith whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias: Meges son\\nof Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius commanded the Epeans, while Medon\\nand staunch Podarces led the men of Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard\\nson to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from\\nhis own country, for he had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis,\\nthe wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was the son of Iphiclus son\\nof Phylacus. These two stood in the van of the Phthians, and defended\\nthe ships along with the Boeotians. \\n\\nAjax son of Oileus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son of\\nTelamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the plough\\nwhich they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat steams upwards\\nfrom about the roots of their horns- nothing but the yoke divides\\nthem as they break up the ground till they reach the end of the field-\\neven so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another.\\nMany and brave comrades followed the son of Telamon, to relieve him\\nof his shield when he was overcome with sweat and toil, but the Locrians\\ndid not follow so close after the son of Oileus, for they could not\\nhold their own in a hand-to-hand fight. They had no bronze helmets\\nwith plumes of horse-hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears,\\nbut they had come to Troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted\\nwool from which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of\\nthe Trojans. The others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the\\nbrunt of the fight with the Trojans and with Hector, while the Locrians\\nshot from behind, under their cover; and thus the Trojans began to\\nlose heart, for the arrows threw them into confusion. \\n\\nThe Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the ships\\nand tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently said to\\nHector, \"Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice. Because\\nheaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, you think that\\nyou must therefore excel others in counsel; but you cannot thus claim\\npreeminence in all things. Heaven has made one man an excellent soldier;\\nof another it has made a dancer or a singer and player on the lyre;\\nwhile yet in another Jove has implanted a wise understanding of which\\nmen reap fruit to the saving of many, and he himself knows more about\\nit than any one; therefore I will say what I think will be best. The\\nfight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now that\\nthe Trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in full armour,\\nwhile others are fighting scattered and outnumbered near the ships.\\nDraw back, therefore, and call your chieftains round you, that we\\nmay advise together whether to fall now upon the ships in the hope\\nthat heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to beat a retreat while we\\ncan yet safely do so. I greatly fear that the Achaeans will pay us\\ntheir debt of yesterday in full, for there is one abiding at their\\nships who is never weary of battle, and who will not hold aloof much\\nlonger.\" \\n\\nThus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprang\\nin full armour from his chariot and said, \"Polydamas, gather the chieftains\\nhere; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return at once when\\nI have given them their orders.\" \\n\\nHe then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loud\\ncry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. When they\\nheard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas the excellent\\nson of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost, looking everywhere\\nto find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son of Asius, and Asius\\nson of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless he could no longer\\nfind them, for the two last were lying by the sterns of the Achaean\\nships, slain by the Argives, while the others had been also stricken\\nand wounded by them; but upon the left wing of the dread battle he\\nfound Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, cheering his men and urging\\nthem on to fight. He went up to him and upbraided him. \"Paris,\" said\\nhe, \"evil-hearted Paris, fair to see but woman-mad and false of tongue,\\nwhere are Deiphobus and King Helenus? Where are Adamas son of Asius,\\nand Asius son of Hyrtacus? Where too is Othryoneus? Ilius is undone\\nand will now surely fall!\" \\n\\nAlexandrus answered, \"Hector, why find fault when there is no one\\nto find fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day rather\\nthan this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about\\nme. From the moment when you set our men fighting about the ships\\nwe have been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comrades\\nabout whom you ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alone have\\nleft the field, wounded both of them in the hand, but the son of Saturn\\nsaved them alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us\\ngo, and we will follow with right goodwill; you shall not find us\\nfail you in so far as our strength holds out, but no man can do more\\nthan in him lies, no matter how willing he may be.\" \\n\\nWith these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went towards\\nthe part of the battle where the fight was thickest, about Cebriones,\\nbrave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius,\\nand Morys son of Hippotion, who had come from fertile Ascania on the\\npreceding day to relieve other troops. Then Jove urged them on to\\nfight. They flew forth like the blasts of some fierce wind that strike\\nearth in the van of a thunderstorm- they buffet the salt sea into\\nan uproar; many and mighty are the great waves that come crashing\\nin one after the other upon the shore with their arching heads all\\ncrested with foam- even so did rank behind rank of Trojans arrayed\\nin gleaming armour follow their leaders onward. The way was led by\\nHector son of Priam, peer of murderous Mars, with his round shield\\nbefore him- his shield of ox-hides covered with plates of bronze-\\nand his gleaming helmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward\\nunder cover of his shield in every direction, making trial of the\\nranks to see if they would give way be him, but he could not daunt\\nthe courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first to stride out and\\nchallenge him. \"Sir,\" he cried, \"draw near; why do you think thus\\nvainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellent soldiers,\\nbut the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Your heart, forsooth,\\nis set on destroying our ships, but we too have bands that can keep\\nyou at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner taken and sacked\\nby ourselves. The time is near when you shall pray Jove and all the\\ngods in your flight, that your steeds may be swifter than hawks as\\nthey raise the dust on the plain and bear you back to your city.\"\\n\\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and the\\nhost of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. But\\nHector answered, \"Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I\\nwere as sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, with\\nQueen Juno for my mother, and of being held in like honour with Minerva\\nand Apollo, as I am that this day is big with the destruction of the\\nAchaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dare abide my spear;\\nit shall rend your fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds\\nof prey with your fat and your flesh, as you fall by the ships of\\nthe Achaeans.\" \\n\\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after with\\na cry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argives\\non their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their prowess,\\nbut stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojan chieftains, and\\nthe cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to the brightness\\nof Jove\\'s presence. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XIV\\n\\nNestor was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not escape\\nhim, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, \"What, noble Machaon,\\nis the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our ships\\ngrow stronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over your\\nwine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted\\nblood from off you. I will go at once to the look-out station and\\nsee what it is all about.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was\\nlying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken\\nhis father\\'s shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear,\\nand as soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans\\nwho, now that their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before\\nthe Trojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the\\nwaves are dumb- they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter\\nwhence the fierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where\\nthey are and set neither this way nor that, till some particular wind\\nsweeps down from heaven to determine them- even so did the old man\\nponder whether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of\\nAgamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus;\\nbut meanwhile the hosts were fighting and killing one another, and\\nthe hard bronze rattled on their bodies, as they thrust at one another\\nwith their swords and spears. \\n\\nThe wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son of\\nAtreus, fell in Nestor as they were coming up from their ships- for\\ntheirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was going on,\\nbeing on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached first,\\nwhile the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch of\\nthe shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the ships,\\nand the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placed the\\nships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the whole opening\\nof the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings, leaning\\non their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being in great\\nanxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with dismay.\\nThen King Agamemnon said to him, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to\\nthe Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I fear\\nthat what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among\\nthe Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had fired\\nour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all coming\\ntrue. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in anger with\\nme that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships.\"\\n\\nThen Nestor knight of Gerene answered, \"It is indeed as you say; it\\nis all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders from\\non high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we relied as\\nan impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The Trojans are\\nfighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you\\nmay you cannot see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming;\\nthey are being killed in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends\\nto heaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any use, what we had\\nbetter do; but I do not advise our going into battle ourselves, for\\na man cannot fight when he is wounded.\" \\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed fighting\\nat the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench has\\nserved us- over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they deemed\\nwould be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet- I see it\\nmust be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously\\nhere, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to defend us, and\\nI know now that he is raising the Trojans to like honour with the\\ngods, while us, on the other hand, he bas bound hand and foot. Now,\\ntherefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring down the ships that\\nare on the beach and draw them into the water; let us make them fast\\nto their mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of night-\\nif even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may then\\ndraw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in flying\\nruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly and\\nbe saved than be caught and killed.\" \\n\\nUlysses looked fiercely at him and said, \"Son of Atreus, what are\\nyou talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other and\\nbaser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a\\nlife of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of\\nus perish. Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win\\nwhich we have suffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some\\nother of the Achaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to give\\ngood counsel, no king over so great a host as that of the Argives\\nshould ever have let fall from his lips. I despise your judgement\\nutterly for what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us draw\\ndown our ships into the water while the battle is raging, and thus\\nplay further into the hands of the conquering Trojans? It would be\\nruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting when they see the ships\\nbeing drawn into the water, but will cease attacking and keep turning\\ntheir eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir captain, would\\nbe our destruction.\" \\n\\nAgamemnon answered, \"Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart.\\nI am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into\\nthe sea whether they will or no. Some one, it may be, old or young,\\ncan offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice to hear.\"\\n\\nThen said Diomed, \"Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek,\\nif you will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger\\nthan any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who\\nlies buried at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,\\nAgrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was\\nthe knight Oeneus, my father\\'s father, and he was the most valiant\\nof them all. Oeeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as\\nJove and the other gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married\\ninto the family of Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance,\\nfor he had large estates of rich corn-growing land, with much orchard\\nground as well, and he had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the\\nArgives in the use of the spear. You must yourselves have heard whether\\nthese things are true or no; therefore when I say well despise not\\nmy words as though I were a coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then,\\nlet us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though we be. When\\nthere, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the range of the spears\\nlest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we have already, but\\nwe can spur on others, who have been indulging their spleen and holding\\naloof from battle hitherto.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,\\nKing Agamemnon leading the way. \\n\\nMeanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them\\nin the semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon\\'s right hand in\\nhis own and said, \"Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that\\nhe sees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse-\\nmay he come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself,\\nthe blessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the\\nprinces and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust\\nupon the plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tents\\ntowards their city.\" \\n\\nWith this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to the\\nplain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine\\nor ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight,\\nand it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war\\nand do battle without ceasing. \\n\\nJuno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of\\nOlympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at\\nonce her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither\\namid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the\\ntopmost crests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set herself\\nto think how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed that\\nit would be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in rich attire,\\nin the hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, and wish to embrace\\nher. While he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be\\nmade to steal over his eyes and senses. \\n\\nShe went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made her,\\nand the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a secret\\nkey so that no other god could open them. Here she entered and closed\\nthe doors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her fair body\\nwith ambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil, ambrosial,\\nvery soft, and scented specially for herself- if it were so much as\\nshaken in the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervaded the\\nuniverse of heaven and earth. With this she anointed her delicate\\nskin, and then she plaited the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in\\na stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. She put on the\\nwondrous robe which Minerva had worked for her with consummate art,\\nand had embroidered with manifold devices; she fastened it about her\\nbosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself with a girdle that\\nhad a hundred tassels: then she fastened her earrings, three brilliant\\npendants that glistened most beautifully, through the pierced lobes\\nof her ears, and threw a lovely new veil over her head. She bound\\nher sandals on to her feet, and when she had arrayed herself perfectly\\nto her satisfaction, she left her room and called Venus to come aside\\nand speak to her. \"My dear child,\" said she, \"will you do what I am\\ngoing to ask of you, or will refuse me because you are angry at my\\nbeing on the Danaan side, while you are on the Trojan?\" \\n\\nJove\\'s daughter Venus answered, \"Juno, august queen of goddesses,\\ndaughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it for\\nat once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.\" \\n\\nThen Juno told her a lying tale and said, \"I want you to endow me\\nwith some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all\\nthings mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world\\'s\\nend to visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys:\\nthey received me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up,\\nhaving taken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn\\nin the depths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them\\nthat I may make peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and\\nare so angry that they have not slept with one another this long while;\\nif I can bring them round and restore them to one another\\'s embraces,\\nthey will be grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards.\"\\n\\nThereon laughter-loving Venus said, \"I cannot and must not refuse\\nyou, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered girdle\\ninto which all her charms had been wrought- love, desire, and that\\nsweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most prudent.\\nShe gave the girdle to Juno and said, \"Take this girdle wherein all\\nmy charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will wear it I promise\\nyou that your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless.\"\\n\\nWhen she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the girdle\\nin her bosom. \\n\\nVenus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down\\nfrom the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair Emathia,\\nand went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the Thracian\\nhorsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever setting\\nfoot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the, waves\\nof the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas. There\\nshe met Sleep, own brother to Death, and caught him by the hand, saying,\\n\"Sleep, you who lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if you ever\\ndid me a service in times past, do one for me now, and I shall be\\ngrateful to you ever after. Close Jove\\'s keen eyes for me in slumber\\nwhile I hold him clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful\\ngolden seat, that can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son Vulcan\\nshall make it for you, and he shall give it a footstool for you to\\nrest your fair feet upon when you are at table.\" \\n\\nThen Sleep answered, \"Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of\\nmighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep without\\ncompunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all\\nof them proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep\\nunless he bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what\\nyou asked me, on the day when Jove\\'s mighty son Hercules set sail\\nfrom Ilius after having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding\\nI suffused my sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and\\nlaid him to rest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and\\nset the blasts of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took\\nhim to the goodly city of Cos away from all his friends. Jove was\\nfurious when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the\\nhouse; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would have\\nflung me down through space into the sea where I should never have\\nbeen heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and gods protected\\nme. I fled to her and Jove left off looking for me in spite of his\\nbeing so angry, for he did not dare do anything to displease Night.\\nAnd now you are again asking me to do something on which I cannot\\nventure.\" \\n\\nAnd Juno said, \"Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into\\nyour head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans,\\nas he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the\\nyoungest of the Graces, and she shall be your own- Pasithea, whom\\nyou have always wanted to marry.\" \\n\\nSleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, \"Then swear it\\nto me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the bounteous\\nearth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods\\nwho dwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, and see that\\nyou really do give me one of the youngest of the Graces- Pasithea,\\nwhom I have always wanted to marry.\" \\n\\nJuno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of the\\nnether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had completed\\nher oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist and sped lightly\\nforward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them. Presently they reached\\nmany-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Lectum where they\\nleft the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the trees of the forest\\nsoughed under the going of their feet. Here Sleep halted, and ere\\nJove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty pine-tree- the tallest\\nthat reared its head towards heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind\\nthe branches and sat there in the semblance of the sweet-singing bird\\nthat haunts the mountains and is called Chalcis by the gods, but men\\ncall it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the topmost peak of\\nIda, and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as\\nhe did so he became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her\\nthat he had felt when they had first enjoyed each other\\'s embraces,\\nand slept with one another without their dear parents knowing anything\\nabout it. He went up to her and said, \"What do you want that you have\\ncome hither from Olympus- and that too with neither chariot nor horses\\nto convey you?\" \\n\\nThen Juno told him a lying tale and said, \"I am going to the world\\'s\\nend, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mother Tethys;\\nthey received me into their house, took care of me, and brought me\\nup. I must go and see them that I may make peace between them: they\\nhave been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not slept with\\none another this long time. The horses that will take me over land\\nand sea are stationed on the lowermost spurs of many-fountained Ida,\\nand I have come here from Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was\\nafraid you might be angry with me later on, if I went to the house\\nof Oceanus without letting you know.\" \\n\\nAnd Jove said, \"Juno, you can choose some other time for paying your\\nvisit to Oceanus- for the present let us devote ourselves to love\\nand to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so overpowered\\nby passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at this moment\\nfor yourself- not even when I was in love with the wife of Ixion who\\nbore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with Danae the\\ndaintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me the famed hero Perseus.\\nThen there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore me Minos and Rhadamanthus:\\nthere was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot my lion-hearted\\nson Hercules, while Semele became mother to Bacchus the comforter\\nof mankind. There was queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and yourself-\\nbut with none of these was I ever so much enamoured as I now am with\\nyou.\" \\n\\nJuno again answered him with a lying tale. \"Most dread son of Saturn,\"\\nshe exclaimed, \"what are you talking about? Would you have us enjoy\\none another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can be\\nseen? What if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping together,\\nand tell the others? It would be such a scandal that when I had risen\\nfrom your embraces I could never show myself inside your house again;\\nbut if you are so minded, there is a room which your son Vulcan has\\nmade me, and he has given it good strong doors; if you would so have\\nit, let us go thither and lie down.\" \\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"Juno, you need not be afraid that either god or\\nman will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense golden\\ncloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams shall not\\nsee through it.\" \\n\\nWith this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace; whereon\\nthe earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with dew-bespangled\\nlotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it raised them\\nwell above the ground. Here they laid themselves down and overhead\\nthey were covered by a fair cloud of gold, from which there fell glittering\\ndew-drops. \\n\\nThus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the crest\\nof Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his spouse\\nin his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the Achaeans,\\nto tell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake. When he\\nhad found him he said, \"Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaans with\\na will, and give them victory though it be only for a short time while\\nJove is still sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet slumber, and\\nJuno has beguiled him into going to bed with her.\" \\n\\nSleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind, leaving\\nNeptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted forward\\namong the first ranks and shouted saying, \"Argives, shall we let Hector\\nson of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himself\\nwith glory? This is what he says that he shall now do, seeing that\\nAchilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall get on very well\\nwithout him if we keep each other in heart and stand by one another.\\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best\\nand largest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally\\nforth with our longest spears in our hands; will lead you on, and\\nHector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out against\\nus. If any good staunch soldier has only a small shield, let him hand\\nit over to a worse man, and take a larger one for himself.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of Tydeus,\\nUlysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the others in\\narray, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour;\\nthe most valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse to the worse\\nman. When they had donned their bronze armour they marched on with\\nNeptune at their head. In his strong hand he grasped his terrible\\nsword, keen of edge and flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes\\nacross it in the day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away\\nfrom it. \\n\\nHector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune\\nand Hector waged fierce war on one another- Hector on the Trojan and\\nNeptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces\\nmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of the Achaeans,\\nbut waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly when driven before\\nthe blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roar more\\nfiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor does the wind\\nbellow with ruder music as it tears on through the tops of when it\\nis blowing its hardest, than the terrible shout which the Trojans\\nand Achaeans raised as they sprang upon one another. \\n\\nHector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards\\nhim, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bands\\npassed over his chest- the band of his shield and that of his silver-studded\\nsword- and these protected his body. Hector was angry that his spear\\nshould have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of his men.\\nAs he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon struck him with a stone,\\nof which there were many lying about under the men\\'s feet as they\\nfought- brought there to give support to the ships\\' sides as they\\nlay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of them and struck Hector above\\nthe rim of his shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin round\\nlike a top and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when\\nuprooted by the lightning flash of father Jove, and there is a terrible\\nsmell of brimstone- no man can help being dismayed if he is standing\\nnear it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing- even so did Hector\\nfall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand, but\\nhis shield and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze\\narmour rang about him. \\n\\nThe sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,\\nhoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,\\nbut none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and covered\\nby the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain of the\\nLycians, and noble Glaucus: of the others, too, there was not one\\nwho was unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him\\nto cover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore\\nhim away from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting\\nfor him at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot;\\nthese then took him towards the city groaning and in great pain. When\\nthey reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthus, begotten of Immortal\\nJove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on the\\nground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathed\\nagain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited blood,\\nbut soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again closed\\nin darkness for he was still sturined by the blow. \\n\\nWhen the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and\\nset upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileus\\nbegan by springing on Satnius son of Enops and wounding him with his\\nspear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding\\ncattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came\\nup to him and struck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce\\nfight between Trojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas\\nson of Panthous drew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son\\nof Areilycus on the right shoulder; the terrible spear went right\\nthrough his shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the\\ndust. Polydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, \"Again I take it that\\nthe spear has not sped in vain from the strong hand of the son of\\nPanthous; an Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve him\\nfor a staff as he goes down into the house of Hades.\" \\n\\nThe Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon was\\nmore angry than any, for the man had fallen close be, him; so he aimed\\nat Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by\\nswerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for\\nheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the head springs\\nfrom the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the\\ntendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached\\nthe ground long before his legs and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted\\nto Polydamas saying, \"Think, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether\\nthis man is not as well worth killing as Prothoenor was: he seems\\nrich, and of rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight\\nAntenor, for he is very like him.\" \\n\\nBut he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.\\nAcamas then bestrode his brother\\'s body and wounded Promachus the\\nBoeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother\\'s body\\naway. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, \"Argive archers, braggarts\\nthat you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only, but some\\nof you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how Promachus\\nnow sleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother\\'s blood\\nhas not long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he\\nleaves a kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall.\"\\n\\nHis taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged than\\nany of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not stand his\\nground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master Phorbas,\\nwhom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth than any\\nother of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos now\\nwounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from\\nits socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape of\\nthe neck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos\\nthen drew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and\\nhelmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking\\nin the eye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head,\\nand showed it to the Trojans, vaunting over them as he did so. \"Trojans,\"\\nhe cried, \"bid the father and mother of noble Ilioneus make moan for\\nhim in their house, for the wife also of Promachus son of Alegenor\\nwill never be gladdened by the coming of her dear husband- when we\\nArgives return with our ships from Troy.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about\\nto see whither he might fly for safety. \\n\\nTell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the\\nArgives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of the\\nearthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was\\nfirst to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.\\nAntilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morys\\nand Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son\\nof Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank,\\nand the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among\\nthem; on this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where\\nhe had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son\\nof Oileus killed more than any other, for there was no man so fleet\\nas he to pursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XV\\n\\nBut when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set\\nstakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojans\\nmade a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear.\\nJove now woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying with golden-throned\\nJuno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw the Trojans and\\nAchaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others driving them\\npell-mell before them with King Neptune in their midst. He saw Hector\\nlying on the ground with his comrades gathered round him, gasping\\nfor breath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, for it was not the\\nfeeblest of the Achaeans who struck him. \\n\\nThe sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on Juno.\\n\"I see, Juno,\" said he, \"you mischief- making trickster, that your\\ncunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout of\\nhis host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will\\nbe the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not\\nremember how once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two anvils\\non to your feet, and bound your hands in a chain of gold which none\\nmight break, and you hung in mid-air among the clouds. All the gods\\nin Olympus were in a fury, but they could not reach you to set you\\nfree; when I caught any one of them I gripped him and hurled him from\\nthe heavenly threshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even\\nthis did not relieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which I felt\\nabout noble Hercules whom you and Boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond\\nthe seas to Cos, after suborning the tempests; but I rescued him,\\nand notwithstanding all his mighty labours I brought him back again\\nto Argos. I would remind you of this that you may learn to leave off\\nbeing so deceitful, and discover how much you are likely to gain by\\nthe embraces out of which you have come here to trick me.\"\\n\\nJuno trembled as he spoke, and said, \"May heaven above and earth below\\nbe my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx- and this is the\\nmost solemn oath that a blessed god can take- nay, I swear also by\\nyour own almighty head and by our bridal bed- things over which I\\ncould never possibly perjure myself- that Neptune is not punishing\\nHector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing\\nof mine; it is all of his own mere motion because he was sorry to\\nsee the Achaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him,\\nI should tell him to do as you bid him.\" \\n\\nThe sire of gods and men smiled and answered, \"If you, Juno, were\\nalways to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune,\\nlike it or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking.\\nIf, then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among\\nthe rank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the\\nbow, that I want them- Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and\\ntell Neptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he\\nmay send Hector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he\\nwill thus forget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back\\nin confusion till they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus.\\nAchilles will then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and Hector\\nwill kill him in front of Ilius after he has slain many warriors,\\nand among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill Hector\\nto avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it about that\\nthe Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back till they fulfil\\nthe counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will not stay my anger,\\nnor permit any god to help the Danaans till I have accomplished the\\ndesire of the son of Peleus, according to the promise I made by bowing\\nmy head on the day when Thetis touched my knees and besought me to\\ngive him honour.\" \\n\\nJuno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great Olympus.\\nSwift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vast continents,\\nand he says to himself, \"Now I will be here, or there,\" and he would\\nhave all manner of things- even so swiftly did Juno wing her way till\\nshe came to high Olympus and went in among the gods who were gathered\\nin the house of Jove. When they saw her they all of them came up to\\nher, and held out their cups to her by way of greeting. She let the\\nothers be, but took the cup offered her by lovely Themis, who was\\nfirst to come running up to her. \"Juno,\" said she, \"why are you here?\\nAnd you seem troubled- has your husband the son of Saturn been frightening\\nyou?\" \\n\\nAnd Juno answered, \"Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what\\na proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to table,\\nwhere you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs which\\nhe has avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will be angered by\\nthem, however peaceably he may be feasting now.\" \\n\\nOn this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the house\\nof Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with care,\\nand she spoke up in a rage. \"Fools that we are,\" she cried, \"to be\\nthus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up to him and\\nstay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and cares for\\nnobody, for he knows that he is much stronger than any other of the\\nimmortals. Make the best, therefore, of whatever ills he may choose\\nto send each one of you; Mars, I take it, has had a taste of them\\nalready, for his son Ascalaphus has fallen in battle- the man whom\\nof all others he loved most dearly and whose father he owns himself\\nto be.\" \\n\\nWhen he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat\\nof his hands, and said in anger, \"Do not blame me, you gods that dwell\\nin heaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death\\nof my son, even though it end in my being struck by Jove\\'s lightning\\nand lying in blood and dust among the corpses.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout, while\\nhe put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused to still\\nmore fierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals, had\\nnot Minerva, ararmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her seat\\nand hurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and the shield\\nfrom his shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from his strong\\nhand and set it on one side; then she said to Mars, \"Madman, you are\\nundone; you have ears that hear not, or you have lost all judgement\\nand understanding; have you not heard what Juno has said on coming\\nstraight from the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish to go through\\nall kinds of suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry\\nto Olympus, after having caused infinite mischief to all us others?\\nJove would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves;\\nhe would come to Olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one after\\nanother, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay aside your anger for\\nthe death of your son; better men than he have either been killed\\nalready or will fall hereafter, and one cannot protect every one\\'s\\nwhole family.\" \\n\\nWith these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno called\\nApollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. \"Jove,\" she said\\nto them, \"desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; when you have\\nseen him you are to do as he may then bid you.\" \\n\\nThereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris and\\nApollo made all haste on their way. When they reached many-fountained\\nIda, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seated on topmost Gargarus\\nwith a fragrant cloud encircling his head as with a diadem. They stood\\nbefore his presence, and he was pleased with them for having been\\nso quick in obeying the orders his wife had given them. \\n\\nHe spoke to Iris first. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, tell King Neptune\\nwhat I now bid you- and tell him true. Bid him leave off fighting,\\nand either join the company of the gods, or go down into the sea.\\nIf he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider well whether\\nhe is strong enough to hold his own against me if I attack him. I\\nam older and much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid to set\\nhimself up as on a level with myself, of whom all the other gods stand\\nin awe.\" \\n\\nIris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or snowflakes\\nthat fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas, even so did\\nshe wing her way till she came close up to the great shaker of the\\nearth. Then she said, \"I have come, O dark-haired king that holds\\nthe world in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove. He bids\\nyou leave off fighting, and either join the company of the gods or\\ngo down into the sea; if, however, you take no heed and disobey him,\\nhe says he will come down here and fight you. He would have you keep\\nout of his reach, for he is older and much stronger than you are,\\nand yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself,\\nof whom all the other gods stand in awe.\" \\n\\nNeptune was very angry and said, \"Great heavens! strong as Jove may\\nbe, he has said more than he can do if he has threatened violence\\nagainst me, who am of like honour with himself. We were three brothers\\nwhom Rhea bore to Saturn- Jove, myself, and Hades who rules the world\\nbelow. Heaven and earth were divided into three parts, and each of\\nus was to have an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell to me to\\nhave my dwelling in the sea for evermore; Hades took the darkness\\nof the realms under the earth, while air and sky and clouds were the\\nportion that fell to Jove; but earth and great Olympus are the common\\nproperty of all. Therefore I will not walk as Jove would have me.\\nFor all his strength, let him keep to his own third share and be contented\\nwithout threatening to lay hands upon me as though I were nobody.\\nLet him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters, who\\nmust perforce obey him. \\n\\nIris fleet as the wind then answered, \"Am I really, Neptune, to take\\nthis daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsider\\nyour answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know that\\nthe Erinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person.\"\\n\\nNeptune answered, \"Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in season.\\nIt is well when a messenger shows so much discretion. Nevertheless\\nit cuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke so angrily\\nanother who is his own peer, and of like empire with himself. Now,\\nhowever, I will give way in spite of my displeasure; furthermore let\\nme tell you, and I mean what I say- if contrary to the desire of myself,\\nMinerva driver of the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King Vulcan, Jove\\nspares steep Ilius, and will not let the Achaeans have the great triumph\\nof sacking it, let him understand that he will incur our implacable\\nresentment.\" \\n\\nNeptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely did\\nthe Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, \"Go, dear Phoebus,\\nto Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has now\\ngone down under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure. Had\\nhe not done so those gods who are below with Saturn would have come\\nto hear of the fight between us. It is better for both of us that\\nhe should have curbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for I should\\nhave had much trouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis,\\nand shake it furiously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic;\\ntake, moreover, brave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and\\nrouse him to deeds of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back\\nto their ships and to the Hellespont. From that point I will think\\nit well over, how the Achaeans may have a respite from their troubles.\"\\n\\nApollo obeyed his father\\'s saying, and left the crests of Ida, flying\\nlike a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He found Hector\\nno longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he had just come\\nto himself again. He knew those who were about him, and the sweat\\nand hard breathing had left him from the moment when the will of aegis-bearing\\nJove had revived him. Apollo stood beside him and said, \"Hector, son\\nof Priam, why are you so faint, and why are you here away from the\\nothers? Has any mishap befallen you?\" \\n\\nHector in a weak voice answered, \"And which, kind sir, of the gods\\nare you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me\\non the chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships\\nof the Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure\\nthat this very day I should breathe my last and go down into the house\\nof Hades.\" \\n\\nThen King Apollo said to him, \"Take heart; the son of Saturn has sent\\nyou a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, even\\nme, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian hitherto\\nnot only of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore, order your\\nhorsemen to drive their chariots to the ships in great multitudes.\\nI will go before your horses to smooth the way for them, and will\\nturn the Achaeans in flight.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his people.\\nAnd as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallops gloriously\\nover the plain to the place where he is wont to take his bath in the\\nriver- he tosses his head, and his mane streams over his shoulders\\nas in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to the pastures\\nwhere the mares are feeding- even so Hector, when he heard what the\\ngod said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward as fast as his limbs\\ncould take him. As country peasants set their hounds on to a homed\\nstag or wild goat- he has taken shelter under rock or thicket, and\\nthey cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shouts have\\nroused stands in their path, and they are in no further humour for\\nthe chase- even so the Achaeans were still charging on in a body,\\nusing their swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they\\nsaw Hector going about among his men they were afraid, and their hearts\\nfell down into their feet. \\n\\nThen spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man\\nwho could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,\\nwhile few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided.\\nHe then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: \"What,\\nin heaven\\'s name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again?\\nEvery one made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but\\nit seems that one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killed\\nmany of us Danaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the\\nhand of Jove must be with him or he would never dare show himself\\nso masterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us\\nall do as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall\\nback upon the ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower\\nof the army stand firm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back\\nat the point of our spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive\\nthat he will then think better of it before he tries to charge into\\nthe press of the Danaans.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who were\\nabout Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of Teucer, Meriones,\\nand Meges peer of Mars called all their best men about them and sustained\\nthe fight against Hector and the Trojans, but the main body fell back\\nupon the ships of the Achaeans. \\n\\nThe Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding\\non at their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloud\\nabout his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with its shaggy\\nfringe, which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to strike terror into\\nthe hearts of men. With this in his hand he led on the Trojans.\\n\\nThe Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of battle\\nrose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the bowstrings.\\nMany a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the bodies of\\nmany a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway, before\\nthey could taste of man\\'s fair flesh and glut themselves with blood.\\nSo long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and without shaking\\nit, the weapons on either side took effect and the people fell, but\\nwhen he shook it straight in the face of the Danaans and raised his\\nmighty battle-cry their hearts fainted within them and they forgot\\ntheir former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in the dead of\\nnight on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman\\nis not there- even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for Apollo\\nfilled them with panic and gave victory to Hector and the Trojans.\\n\\nThe fight then became more scattered and they killed one another where\\nthey best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one, leader\\nof the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of Menestheus.\\nAeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard son to Oileus,\\nand brother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own country,\\nfor he had killed a man, a kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom\\nOileus had married. Iasus had become a leader of the Athenians, and\\nwas son of Sphelus the son of Boucolos. Polydamas killed Mecisteus,\\nand Polites Echius, in the front of the battle, while Agenor slew\\nClonius. Paris struck Deiochus from behind in the lower part of the\\nshoulder, as he was flying among the foremost, and the point of the\\nspear went clean through him. \\n\\nWhile they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the Achaeans\\nwere flying pellmell to the trench and the set stakes, and were forced\\nback within their wall. Hector then cried out to the Trojans, \"Forward\\nto the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see any man keeping back\\non the other side the wall away from the ships I will have him killed:\\nhis kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire, but\\ndogs shall tear him in pieces in front of our city.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he laid his whip about his horses\\' shoulders and called\\nto the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted with a\\ncry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with his\\nown. Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the banks of the\\ndeep trench into its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as\\nbroad as the throw of a spear when a man is trying his strength. The\\nTrojan battalions poured over the bridge, and Apollo with his redoubtable\\naegis led the way. He kicked down the wall of the Achaeans as easily\\nas a child who playing on the sea-shore has built a house of sand\\nand then kicks it down again and destroys it- even so did you, O Apollo,\\nshed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with panic and\\nconfusion. \\n\\nThus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out\\nto one another and raising their hands with loud cries every man to\\nheaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted\\nup his hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently\\nthan any of them. \"Father Jove,\" said he, \"if ever any one in wheat-growing\\nArgos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer and prayed that\\nhe might return safely home, whereon you bowed your head to him in\\nassent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans to triumph\\nthus over the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nAll counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to die prayer of the\\naged son of Neleus. When the heard Jove thunder they flung themselves\\nyet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking over the bulwarks\\nof a ship when the sea runs high before a gale- for it is the force\\nof the wind that makes the waves so great- even so did the Trojans\\nspring over the wall with a shout, and drive their chariots onwards.\\nThe two sides fought with their double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand\\nencounter-the Trojans from their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing\\nup into their ships and wielding the long pikes that were lying on\\nthe decks ready for use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod with bronze.\\n\\nNow Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting about\\nthe wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships, remained sitting\\nin the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him with his conversation\\nand spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain. When, however,\\nhe saw the Trojans swarming through the breach in the wall, while\\nthe Achaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, he cried aloud,\\nand smote his two thighs with the flat of his hands. \"Eurypylus,\"\\nsaid he in his dismay, \"I know you want me badly, but I cannot stay\\nwith you any longer, for there is hard fighting going on; a servant\\nshall take care of you now, for I must make all speed to Achilles,\\nand induce him to fight if I can; who knows but with heaven\\'s help\\nI may persuade him. A man does well to listen to the advice of a friend.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm and\\nresisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer in\\nnumber, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither could\\nthe Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among the\\ntents and ships. As a carpenter\\'s line gives a true edge to a piece\\nof ship\\'s timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva\\nhas instructed in all kinds of useful arts- even so level was the\\nissue of the fight between the two sides, as they fought some round\\none and some round another. \\n\\nHector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about the\\nsame ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor\\nyet could Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought\\nhim. \\n\\nThen Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear\\nas he was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the ground\\nand the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen\\nin front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,\\n\"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a\\njot, but rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of\\nhis armour now that he has fallen.\" \\n\\nHe then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit Lycophron\\na follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was living with Ajax\\ninasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans. Hector\\'s spear\\nstruck him on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from the\\nship\\'s prow on to the ground with no life left in him. Ajax shook\\nwith rage and said to his brother, \"Teucer, my good fellow, our trusty\\ncomrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came to live with us from\\nCythera and whom we honoured as much as our own parents. Hector has\\njust killed him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which\\nPhoebus Apollo gave you.\" \\n\\nTeucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver\\nin his hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and\\nhit Cleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son\\nof Panthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to his\\nhorses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,\\ndoing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now come\\nupon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avert\\nit, for the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from\\nhis chariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside.\\nKing Polydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up\\nto the horses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon,\\nand ordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He\\nthen went back and took his place in the front ranks. \\n\\nTeucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have been\\nno more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him then\\nand there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyes\\non Teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring\\nfor him just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim; on this\\nthe arrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands. Teucer shook\\nwith anger and said to his brother, \"Alas, see how heaven thwarts\\nus in all we do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from\\nmy hand, though I strung it this selfsame morning that it might serve\\nme for many an arrow.\" \\n\\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \"My good fellow, let your bow and your\\narrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite the Danaans.\\nTake your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both fight\\nthe Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may be successful\\nfor the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find it a hard\\nmatter to take the ships.\" \\n\\nTeucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield\\nfour hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set\\nhis helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\\nabove it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and forthwith\\nhe was by the side of Ajax. \\n\\nWhen Hector saw that Teucer\\'s bow was of no more use to him, he shouted\\nout to the Trojans and Lycians, \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians\\ngood in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your mettle here\\nat the ships, for I see the weapon of one of their chieftains made\\nuseless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see when Jove is helping\\npeople and means to help them still further, or again when he is bringing\\nthem down and will do nothing for them; he is now on our side, and\\nis going against the Argives. Therefore swarm round the ships and\\nfight. If any of you is struck by spear or sword and loses his life,\\nlet him die; he dies with honour who dies fighting for his country;\\nand he will leave his wife and children safe behind him, with his\\nhouse and allotment unplundered if only the Achaeans can be driven\\nback to their own land, they and their ships.\" \\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the\\nother side exhorted his comrades saying, \"Shame on you Argives, we\\nare now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the\\nenemy from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you\\nwill be able to get home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on\\nhis whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they\\nare not at a dance but in battle? Our only course is to fight them\\nwith might and main; we had better chance it, life or death, once\\nfor all, than fight long and without issue hemmed in at our ships\\nby worse men than ourselves.\" \\n\\nWith these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then killed\\nSchedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajax killed\\nLaodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamas killed\\nOtus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of the proud\\nEpeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but Polydamas crouched\\ndown, and he missed him, for Apollo would not suffer the son of Panthous\\nto fall in battle; but the spear hit Croesmus in the middle of his\\nchest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped him\\nof his armour. At that moment the valiant soldier Dolops son of Lampus\\nsprang upon Lampus was son of Laomedon and for his valour, while his\\nson Dolops was versed in all the ways of war. He then struck the middle\\nof the son of Phyleus\\' shield with his spear, setting on him at close\\nquarters, but his good corslet made with plates of metal saved him;\\nPhyleus had brought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where his\\nhost, King Euphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect\\nhim. It now served to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck\\nthe topmost crest of Dolops\\'s bronze helmet with his spear and tore\\naway its plume of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet\\nas it was it tumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting\\nand confident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got\\nby the side of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder,\\nfrom behind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into\\nhis chest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him\\nto strip him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers\\nfor help, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon,\\nwho erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before\\nthe war broke out; but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went\\nback to Ilius, where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near\\nPriam who treated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him\\nand said, \"Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note\\nof the death of your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying\\nto take Dolops\\'s armour? Follow me; there must be no fighting the\\nArgives from a distance now, but we must do so in close combat till\\neither we kill them or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her\\npeople.\" \\n\\nHe led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after. Meanwhile\\nAjax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. \"My friends,\" he\\ncried, \"be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves in battle so as\\nto win respect from one another. Men who respect each other\\'s good\\nopinion are less likely to be killed than those who do not, but in\\nflight there is neither gain nor glory.\" \\n\\nThus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back the\\nTrojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with\\na wall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of the\\nloud battle-cry urged Antilochus on. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"you are\\nyoung and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more\\nvaliant than you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and\\nkill him.\" \\n\\nHe hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once darted\\nout from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking carefully\\nround him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart did not\\nspeed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippus the proud\\nson of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming forward,\\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\\nAntilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn which a hunter\\nhas hit as it was breaking away from its covert, and killed it. Even\\nso, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus spring upon you to strip\\nyou of your armour; but noble Hector marked him, and came running\\nup to him through the thick of the battle. Antilochus, brave soldier\\nthough he was, would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage\\ncreature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed\\na dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can\\nbe gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor fly, and the\\nTrojans and Hector with a cry that rent the air showered their weapons\\nafter him; nor did he turn round and stay his flight till he had reached\\nhis comrades. \\n\\nThe Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the ships\\nin fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them on to\\nnew deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argives\\nand defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving\\nglory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the\\nships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had\\nmade him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he should see the glare\\nof a blazing ship. From that hour he was about so to order that the\\nTrojans should be driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory\\nto the Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam,\\nwho was cager enough already, to assail the ships. His fury was as\\nthat of Mars, or as when a fire is raging in the glades of some dense\\nforest upon the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared\\nunder his terrible eye-brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples\\nby reason of the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was with\\nhim, and though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory\\nand glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already Pallas\\nMinerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands of\\nthe son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to break the ranks\\nof the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in the goodliest\\narmour; but do what he might he could not break through them, for\\nthey stood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff rising from\\nthe grey sea that braves the anger of the gale, and of the waves that\\nthunder up against it. He fell upon them like flames of fire from\\nevery quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high by wind and storm,\\nbreaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roar\\nagainst the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, and\\nthey are saved but by a very little from destruction- even so were\\nthe hearts of the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lion\\nattacking a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the\\nlow-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore- the herdsman is at his\\nwit\\'s end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now in the\\nvan and now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion springs into\\nthe thick of them and fastens on a cow so that they all tremble for\\nfear- even so were the Achaeans utterly panic-stricken by Hector and\\nfather Jove. Nevertheless Hector only killed Periphetes of Mycenae;\\nhe was son of Copreus who was wont to take the orders of King Eurystheus\\nto mighty Hercules, but the son was a far better man than the father\\nin every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior, and in understanding\\nranked among the foremost men of Mycenae. He it was who then afforded\\nHector a triumph, for as he was turning back he stumbled against the\\nrim of his shield which reached his feet, and served to keep the javelins\\noff him. He tripped against this and fell face upward, his helmet\\nringing loudly about his head as he did so. Hector saw him fall and\\nran up to him; he then thrust a spear into his chest, and killed him\\nclose to his own comrades. These, for all their sorrow, could not\\nhelp him for they were themselves terribly afraid of Hector.\\n\\nThey had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had been\\ndrawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans came pouring\\nafter them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of ships,\\nbut they made a stand by their tents without being broken up and scattered;\\nshame and fear restrained them. They kept shouting incessantly to\\none another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans,\\nwas loudest in imploring every man by his parents, and beseeching\\nhim to stand firm. \\n\\n\"Be men, my friends,\" he cried, \"and respect one another\\'s good opinion.\\nThink, all of you, on your children, your wives, your property, and\\nyour parents whether these be alive or dead. On their behalf though\\nthey are not here, I implore you to stand firm, and not to turn in\\nflight.\" \\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva lifted\\nthe thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon\\nthem, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight was\\nraging. They could see Hector and all his men, both those in the rear\\nwho were taking no part in the battle, and those who were fighting\\nby the ships. \\n\\nAjax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but strode\\nfrom deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve cubits\\nlong and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of horsemanship\\ncouples four horses together and comes tearing full speed along the\\npublic way from the country into some large town- many both men and\\nwomen marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time changing his\\nhorse, springing from one to another without ever missing his feet\\nwhile the horses are at a gallop- even so did Ajax go striding from\\none ship\\'s deck to another, and his voice went up into the heavens.\\nHe kept on shouting his orders to the Danaans and exhorting them to\\ndefend their ships and tents; neither did Hector remain within the\\nmain body of the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle swoops down upon\\na flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river-geese, it may be, or cranes,\\nor long-necked swans- even so did Hector make straight for a dark-prowed\\nship, rushing right towards it; for Jove with his mighty hand impelled\\nhim forward, and roused his people to follow him. \\n\\nAnd now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would have\\nthought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely did\\nthey fight; and this was the mind in which they were- the Achaeans\\ndid not believe they should escape destruction but thought themselves\\ndoomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat high with\\nthe hope of firing the ships and putting the Achaean heroes to the\\nsword. \\n\\nThus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of the\\ngood ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore him\\nback to his native land. Round this ship there raged a close hand-to-hand\\nfight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fight at a distance\\nwith bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at one another in\\nclose combat with their mighty swords and spears pointed at both ends;\\nthey fought moreover with keen battle-axes and with hatchets. Many\\na good stout blade hilted and scabbarded with iron, fell from hand\\nor shoulder as they fought, and the earth ran red with blood. Hector,\\nwhen he had seized the ship, would not loose his hold but held on\\nto its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans, \"Bring fire, and raise\\nthe battle-cry all of you with a single voice. Now has Jove vouchsafed\\nus a day that will pay us for all the rest; this day we shall take\\nthe ships which came hither against heaven\\'s will, and which have\\ncaused us such infinite suffering through the cowardice of our councillors,\\nwho when I would have done battle at the ships held me back and forbade\\nthe host to follow me; if Jove did then indeed warp our judgements,\\nhimself now commands me and cheers me on.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the Achaeans,\\nand Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome by the darts\\nthat were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed. Therefore\\nhe left the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to the seven-foot\\nbench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out, and with his\\nspear held back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the ships. All\\nthe time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice and exhorting\\nthe Danaans. \"My friends,\" he cried, \"Danaan heroes, servants of Mars,\\nbe men my friends, and fight with might and with main. Can we hope\\nto find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely than\\nthe one we have? There is no strong city within reach, whence we may\\ndraw fresh forces to turn the scales in our favour. We are on the\\nplain of the armed Trojans with the sea behind us, and far from our\\nown country. Our salvation, therefore, is in the might of our hands\\nand in hard fighting.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when\\nany Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector\\'s bidding, he\\nwould be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long spear.\\nTwelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the ships.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XVI\\n\\nThus did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus\\ndrew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some\\nspring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice.\\nWhen Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said,\\n\"Why, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child\\nthat comes running to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried-\\nshe catches hold of her mother\\'s dress to stay her though she is in\\na hurry, and looks tearfully up until her mother carries her- even\\nsuch tears, Patroclus, are you now shedding. Have you anything to\\nsay to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthia\\nwhich you alone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is still\\nalive, as also Peleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons- men whose\\nloss we two should bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the\\nArgives and the way in which they are being killed at the ships, throu\\ntheir own high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell\\nme that both of us may know about it.\" \\n\\nThen, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered, \"Achilles,\\nson of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not be angry,\\nbut I weep for the disaster that has now befallen the Argives. All\\nthose who have been their champions so far are lying at the ships,\\nwounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus has been hit\\nwith a spear, while famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have received sword-wounds;\\nEurypylus again has been struck with an arrow in the thigh; skilled\\napothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healing them of their\\nwounds; are you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it never be\\nmy lot to nurse such a passion as you have done, to the baning of\\nyour own good name. Who in future story will speak well of you unless\\nyou now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity; knight Peleus\\nwas not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the grey sea bore\\nyou and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel and remorseless are you.\\nIf however you are kept back through knowledge of some oracle, or\\nif your mother Thetis has told you something from the mouth of Jove,\\nat least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if I may bring deliverance\\nto the Danaans. Let me moreover wear your armour; the Trojans may\\nthus mistake me for you and quit the field, so that the hard-pressed\\nsons of the Achaeans may have breathing time- which while they are\\nfighting may hardly be. We who are fresh might soon drive tired men\\nback from our ships and tents to their own city.\" \\n\\nHe knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own\\ndestruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, \"What, noble\\nPatroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding,\\nnor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove, but I am\\ncut to the very heart that one of my own rank should dare to rob me\\nbecause he is more powerful than I am. This, after all that I have\\ngone through, is more than I can endure. The girl whom the sons of\\nthe Achaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spear on\\nhaving sacked a city- her has King Agamemnon taken from me as though\\nI were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no man\\nmay keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till battle\\nand the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird\\nmy armour about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle,\\nfor the dark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet;\\nthe Argives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow\\nspace, and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out against\\nthem, because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near them.\\nHad they seen this, there would not have been a creek nor grip that\\nhad not been filled with their dead as they fled back again. And so\\nit would have been, if only King Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me.\\nAs it is the Trojans have beset our host. Diomed son of Tydeus no\\nlonger wields his spear to defend the Danaans, neither have I heard\\nthe voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hated head, whereas\\nthat of murderous Hector rings in my cars as he gives orders to the\\nTrojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill the whole plain with\\ntheir cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fall upon them and save\\nthe fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent us from being able\\nto return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that you may win me great\\nhonour from all the Danaans, and that they may restore the girl to\\nme again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When you have driven\\nthe Trojans from the ships, come back again. Though Juno\\'s thundering\\nhusband should put triumph within your reach, do not fight the Trojans\\nfurther in my absence, or you will rob me of glory that should be\\nmine. And do not for lust of battle go on killing the Trojans nor\\nlead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of the ever-living gods from\\nOlympus attack you- for Phoebus Apollo loves them well: return when\\nyou have freed the ships from peril, and let others wage war upon\\nthe plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that not a\\nsingle man of all the Trojans might be left alive, nor yet of the\\nArgives, but that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle\\nthat veils the brow of Troy.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground for\\nthe shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and the\\njavelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed\\nabout his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missiles\\nthat kept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected\\nhis face. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his\\nshield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, they\\ncould not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the\\nsweat rained from every pore of his body, he had not a moment\\'s respite,\\nand on all sides he was beset by danger upon danger. \\n\\nAnd now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how\\nfire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close\\nup and let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax.\\nHe cut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened on\\nto the shaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a\\nheadless spear, while the bronze point flew some way off and came\\nringing down on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this,\\nand was dismayed at seeing that Jove had now left him utterly defenceless\\nand was willing victory for the Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and\\nthe Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped in\\nflame. \\n\\nThe fire was now flaring about the ship\\'s stern, whereon Achilles\\nsmote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, \"Up, noble knight, for\\nI see the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy\\nour ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on your\\narmour at once while I call our people together.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legs\\nwith greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver;\\nafter this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaid\\nand studded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his\\nshoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his\\nhelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\\nabove it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited his hands,\\nbut he did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout and strong,\\nfor none other of the Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles could\\ndo so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion, which Chiron\\nhad cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to\\ndeal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his horses with\\nall speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour next after Achilles,\\nand on whose support in battle he could rely most firmly. Automedon\\ntherefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius, steeds that could\\nfly like the wind: these were they whom the harpy Podarge bore to\\nthe west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of the\\nriver Oceanus. In the side traces he set the noble horse Pedasus,\\nwhom Achilles had brought away with him when he sacked the city of\\nEetion, and who, mortal steed though he was, could take his place\\nalong with those that were immortal. \\n\\nMeanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade\\nhis Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves\\nthat are feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the\\nmountains, and their jaws are red with blood- they go in a pack to\\nlap water from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and\\nthey reek of blood and slaughter; they know not what fear is, for\\nit is hunger drives them- even so did the leaders and counsellors\\nof the Myrmidons gather round the good squire of the fleet descendant\\nof Aeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both\\nmen and horses. \\n\\nFifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there\\nwas a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom\\nhe could trust, while he was himself commander over them all. Menesthius\\nof the gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius that streams\\nfrom heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair Polydora daughter\\nof Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheius- a woman mated with\\na god- but he was called son of Borus son of Perieres, with whom his\\nmother was living as his wedded wife, and who gave great wealth to\\ngain her. The second company was led by noble Eudorus, son to an unwedded\\nwoman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas the graceful dancer, bore him;\\nthe mighty slayer of Argos was enamoured of her as he saw her among\\nthe singing women at a dance held in honour of Diana the rushing huntress\\nof the golden arrows; he therefore- Mercury, giver of all good- went\\nwith her into an upper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon\\nshe bore him a noble son Eudorus, singularly fleet of foot and in\\nfight valiant. When Ilithuia goddess of the pains of child-birth brought\\nhim to the light of day, and he saw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles\\nson of Actor took the mother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain\\nher, but her father Phylas brought the child up, and took care of\\nhim, doting as fondly upon him as though he were his own son. The\\nthird company was led by Pisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman\\namong all the Myrmidons next to Achilles\\' own comrade Patroclus. The\\nold knight Phoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon,\\nnoble son of Laerceus of the fifth. \\n\\nWhen Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with their\\ncaptains, he charged them straitly saying, \"Myrmidons, remember your\\nthreats against the Trojans while you were at the ships in the time\\nof my anger, and you were all complaining of me. \\'Cruel son of Peleus,\\'\\nyou would say, \\'your mother must have suckled you on gall, so ruthless\\nare you. You keep us here at the ships against our will; if you are\\nso relentless it were better we went home over the sea.\\' Often have\\nyou gathered and thus chided with me. The hour is now come for those\\nhigh feats of arms that you have so long been pining for, therefore\\nkeep high hearts each one of you to do battle with the Trojans.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they serried\\ntheir companies yet more closely when they heard the of their king.\\nAs the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high house\\nwhich is to give shelter from the winds- even so closely were the\\nhelmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield pressed\\non shield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they that the\\nhorse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched\\neach other as they bent their heads. \\n\\nIn front of them all two men put on their armour- Patroclus and Automedon-\\ntwo men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then Achilles went\\ninside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest which silver-footed\\nThetis had given him to take on board ship, and which she had filled\\nwith shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and good thick rugs. In\\nthis chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which no man but\\nhimself might drink, nor would he make offering from it to any other\\ngod save only to father Jove. He took the cup from the chest and cleansed\\nit with sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, and after he\\nhad washed his hands he drew wine. Then he stood in the middle of\\nthe court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making his drink-offering\\nof wine; nor was he unseen of Jove whose joy is in thunder. \"King\\nJove,\" he cried, \"lord of Dodona, god of the Pelasgi, who dwellest\\nafar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your sway, where your prophets\\nthe Selli dwell around you with their feet unwashed and their couches\\nmade upon the ground- if you heard me when I prayed to you aforetime,\\nand did me honour while you sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe\\nme now the fulfilment of yet this further prayer. I shall stay here\\nwhere my ships are lying, but I shall send my comrade into battle\\nat the head of many Myrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory\\nmay go with him; put your courage into his heart that Hector may learn\\nwhether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether his might\\nis only then so indomitable when I myself enter the turmoil of war.\\nAfterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of battle from\\nthe ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with his armour and\\nhis comrades, fighters in close combat.\" \\n\\nThus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part\\nof it he did indeed vouchsafe him- but not the whole. He granted that\\nPatroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but refused\\nto let him come safely out of the fight. \\n\\nWhen he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles\\nwent inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.\\n\\nThen he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce\\nfight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans. \\n\\nMeanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till\\nthey sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out\\nlike wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children\\nlove to tease, whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung-\\nor again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident,\\nevery wasp will come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones-\\neven with such rage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their\\nships, and their cry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus called\\nout to his men at the top of his voice, \"Myrmidons, followers of Achilles\\nson of Peleus, be men my friends, fight with might and with main,\\nthat we may win glory for the son of Peleus, who is far the foremost\\nman at the ships of the Argives- he, and his close fighting followers.\\nThe son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing\\nno respect to the bravest of the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they fell\\nin a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the cry which\\nthe Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son of Menoetius\\nand his squire all gleaming in their armour, they were daunted and\\ntheir battalions were thrown into confusion, for they thought the\\nfleet son of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, and have been\\nreconciled to Agamemnon; every one, therefore, looked round about\\nto see whither he might fly for safety. \\n\\nPatroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where men\\nwere packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus.\\nHe hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon\\nand the broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on the\\nright shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on\\nthis his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader,\\nwho was the finest soldier among them, Patroclus struck panic into\\nthem all. He thus drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that\\nwas then blazing- leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was.\\nThe Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent the skies,\\nwhile the Danaans poured after them from their ships, shouting also\\nwithout ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the thunder-cloud, spreads\\na dense canopy on the top of some lofty mountain, and all the peaks,\\nthe jutting headlands, and forest glades show out in the great light\\nthat flashes from the bursting heavens, even so when the Danaans had\\nnow driven back the fire from their ships, they took breath for a\\nlittle while; but the fury of the fight was not yet over, for the\\nTrojans were not driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle,\\nand were ousted from their ground only by sheer fighting.\\n\\nThe fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed one\\nanother when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius first\\ndrove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was turning\\nround; the point went clean through, and broke the bone so that he\\nfell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest, where\\nit was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The son\\nof Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he could do\\nso took aim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles are\\nthicker than in any other part; the spear tore through all the sinews\\nof the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sons of Nestor\\none, Antilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point of the spear\\nthrough his throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang on Antilochus\\nin hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body\\nspear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him, and\\nin a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow;\\nhis aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root\\nof his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell heavily\\nto the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did these\\ntwo noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain by the two\\nsons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of Amisodorus, who had\\nreared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. Ajax son of Oileus\\nsprang on Cleobulus and took him alive as he was entangled in the\\ncrush; but he killed him then and there by a sword-blow on the neck.\\nThe sword reeked with his blood, while dark death and the strong hand\\nof fate gripped him and closed his eyes. \\n\\nPeneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed each\\nother with their spears. They had both thrown without effect, so now\\nthey drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest of Peneleos\\'\\nhelmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote Lycon\\non the neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the head was\\nheld on by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life left in\\nhim. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on foot and caught him up just\\nas he was about to mount his chariot; he drove a spear through his\\nright shoulder so that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyes\\nwere closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the\\nbronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the brain,\\ncrashing in among the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth\\nwere all of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream\\nfrom both his eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils,\\nand the darkness of death enfolded him round about. \\n\\nThus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his man.\\nAs ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when\\nthey are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock\\nthrough the carelessness of the shepherd- and when the wolves see\\nthis they pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves-\\neven so did the Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with ill-omened\\ncries in their panic and had no more fight left in them.\\n\\nMeanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector,\\nbut Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well under\\ncover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the whizzing\\nof the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He well knew that\\nthe fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood his ground and\\ntried to protect his comrades. \\n\\nAs when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a\\nclear sky when Jove is brewing a gale- even with such panic stricken\\nrout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going.\\nHector\\'s fleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and\\nhe left the Trojan host penned in by the deep trench against their\\nwill. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in\\nthe trench and left their master\\'s car behind them. Patroclus gave\\nchase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against\\nthe Trojans, who, being now no longer in a body, filled all the ways\\nwith their cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened with the\\nclouds of dust they raised, and the horses strained every nerve in\\ntheir flight from the tents and ships towards the city. \\n\\nPatroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying\\nin confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were being smashed\\nin all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from his own\\ncar to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whose immortal\\nsteeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench at a bound\\nas they sped onward. He was intent on trying to get near Hector, for\\nhe had set his heart on spearing him, but Hector\\'s horses were now\\nhurrying him away. As the whole dark earth bows before some tempest\\non an autumn day when Jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving\\ncrooked judgement in their courts, and arriving justice therefrom\\nwithout heed to the decrees of heaven- all the rivers run full and\\nthe torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong from the\\nmountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of men-\\neven such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in their\\nflight. \\n\\nPatroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and\\ndrove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach\\nthe city, but he would not Yet them, and bore down on them between\\nthe river and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he then\\navenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it was\\nexposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground.\\nNext he sprang on Thestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled\\nup in his chariot, for he had lost his head and the reins had been\\ntorn out of his hands. Patroclus went up to him and drove a spear\\ninto his right jaw; he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear\\npulled him over the rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of\\nsome jutting rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook\\nand a line- even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping\\nfrom his chariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while\\nfalling. On this, as Erylaus was on to attack him, he struck him full\\non the head with a stone, and his brains were all battered inside\\nhis helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of\\ndeath took hold upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas,\\nAmphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris, lpheus,\\nEuippus and Polymelus son of Argeas. \\n\\nNow when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,\\nbeing overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycians\\nsaying. \"Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle;\\nI will myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so\\nmasterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a brave\\nman upon the ground.\" \\n\\nHe sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he saw\\nthis, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one another\\nwith loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that scream\\nand tear at one another in some high mountain fastness. \\n\\nThe son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said\\nto Juno who was his wife and sister, \"Alas, that it should be the\\nlot of Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of Patroclus.\\nI am in two minds whether to catch him up out of the fight and set\\nhim down safe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, or to let him\\nnow fall by the hand of the son of Menoetius.\" \\n\\nAnd Juno answered, \"Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that you\\nare saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long been\\nfated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall not\\nall of us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to your\\nheart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other\\nof the gods will be also wanting to escort his son out of battle,\\nfor there are many sons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and\\nyou will make every one jealous. If, however, you are fond of him\\nand pity him, let him indeed fall by the hand of Patroclus, but as\\nsoon as the life is gone out of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to\\nbear him off the field and take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where\\nhis brothers and his kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar,\\nin due honour to the dead.\" \\n\\nThe sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood upon\\nthe earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to kill on\\nthe rich plain of Troy far from his home. \\n\\nWhen they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck Thrasydemus,\\nthe brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of the belly, and\\nkilled him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus and missed him,\\nbut he struck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, and it screamed\\naloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life went out of it.\\nThe other two horses began to plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked\\nand they got entangled in the reins through the fall of the horse\\nthat was yoked along with them; but Automedon knew what to do; without\\nthe loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that hung by his sturdy\\nthigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the other two righted\\nthemselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went together into\\nbattle. \\n\\nSarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him,\\nthe point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting\\nhim. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from\\nhis hand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds\\nthe ever-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or\\ntall pine to which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains\\nto make timber for ship-building- even so did he lie stretched at\\nfull length in front of his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching\\nat the blood-stained dust. As when a lion springs with a bound upon\\na herd of cattle and fastens on a great black bull which dies bellowing\\nin its clutches- even so did the leader of the Lycian warriors struggle\\nin death as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. He called on his trusty\\ncomrade and said, \"Glaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth\\nall your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit yourself\\nlike a valiant soldier. First go about among the Lycian captains and\\nbid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do battle to save\\nmy armour from being taken. My name will haunt you henceforth and\\nfor ever if the Achaeans rob me of my armour now that I have fallen\\nat their ships. Do your very utmost and call all my people together.\"\\n\\nDeath closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on his\\nbreast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came out\\nalong with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon\\'s soul\\nat the same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds,\\nwho were wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.\\n\\nGlaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said,\\nfor he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his other\\nhand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer\\'s arrow had\\ngiven him when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, was assailing\\nit. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying, \"Hear me O king\\nfrom your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, or may be in Troy,\\nfor in all places you can hear the prayer of one who is in distress,\\nas I now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain,\\nthere is no staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason\\nof my hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go among my foes and\\nfight them, thou our prince, Jove\\'s son Sarpedon, is slain. Jove defended\\nnot his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me of my wound, ease\\nmy pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the Lycians and to\\nfight along with them round the body of him who has fallen.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,\\nstaunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.\\nGlaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had answered\\nhis prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian captains,\\nand bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From these\\nhe strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthous and Agenor;\\nhe then went in search of Aeneas and Hector, and when he had found\\nthem he said, \"Hector, you have utterly forgotten your allies, who\\nlanguish here for your sake far from friends and home while you do\\nnothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycian warriors has\\nfallen- he who was at once the right and might of Lycia; Mars has\\nlaid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by him, my friends,\\nand suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to treat\\nhis body with contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom we have\\nspeared at the ships.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable grief;\\nfor Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the main stays\\nof their city, both as having much people with him, and himself the\\nforemost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated by the\\nfall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans with all their\\nmight, while the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son of Menoetius cheered\\non the Achaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, men who needed\\nno bidding. \"Ajaxes,\" said he, \"may it now please you to show youselves\\nthe men you have always been, or even better- Sarpedon is fallen-\\nhe who was first to overleap the wall of the Achaeans; let us take\\nthe body and outrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders,\\nand kill his comrades if they try to rescue his body.\" \\n\\nHe spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides, therefore,\\nthe Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the Myrmidons and Achaeans\\non the other, strengthened their battalions, and fought desperately\\nabout the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely the while. Mighty was\\nthe din of their armour as they came together, and Jove shed a thick\\ndarkness over the fight, to increase the of the battle over the body\\nof his son. \\n\\nAt first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for one\\nof the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of noble\\nAgacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; but\\npresently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took refuge\\nwith Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noble steeds\\nto fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him on the\\nhead with a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, and his\\nbrains inside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell face\\nforemost upon the body of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was\\nenraged by the death of his comrade, and sped through the front ranks\\nas swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings.\\nEven so swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, did you make straight for\\nthe Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith he struck\\nSthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and broke\\nthe tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this Hector and\\nthe front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man can throw a\\njavelin when competing for some prize, or even in battle- so far did\\nthe Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans. Glaucus, captain of the\\nLycians, was the first to rally them, by killing Bathycles son of\\nChalcon who lived in Hellas and was the richest man among the Myrmidons.\\nGlaucus turned round suddenly, just as Bathycles who was pursuing\\nhim was about to lay hold of him, and drove his spear right into the\\nmiddle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and the\\nfall of so good a man filled the Achaeans with dismay, while the Trojans\\nwere exultant, and came up in a body round the corpse. Nevertheless\\nthe Achaeans, mindful of their prowess, bore straight down upon them.\\n\\nMeriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus son\\nof Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured by\\nthe people as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under the\\njaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the darkness of death\\nlaid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping\\nto hit him under the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw\\nit coming and stooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew\\npast him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went\\non quivering till Mars robbed it of its force. The spear, therefore,\\nsped from Aeneas\\'s hand in vain and fell quivering to the ground.\\nAeneas was angry and said, \"Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if\\nI had hit you my spear would soon have made an end of you.\"\\n\\nAnd Meriones answered, \"Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will not\\nbe able to make an end of every one who comes against you. You are\\nonly a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle\\nof your shield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you\\nmay be, I should soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life\\nto Hades of the noble steeds.\" \\n\\nOn this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, \"Meriones, hero\\nthough you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my good\\nfriend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; some\\nof them must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words for\\ncouncil; fight, therefore, and say nothing.\" \\n\\nHe led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As\\nthe sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains-\\nand the thud of their axes is heard afar- even such a din now rose\\nfrom earth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as\\nmen smote each other with their swords and spears pointed at both\\nends. A man had need of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so covered\\nwas he from head to foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmed\\nabout the body, as flies that buzz round the full milk-pails in spring\\nwhen they are brimming with milk- even so did they gather round Sarpedon;\\nnor did Jove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight,\\nbut kept looking at it all the time, for he was settling how best\\nto kill Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should be allowed\\nto end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and strip\\nhim of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet further trouble\\nto the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the brave squire\\nof Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojans back\\ntowards the city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, he\\nmade Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and\\nfled, bidding the other Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales\\nof Jove had turned against him. Neither would the brave Lycians stand\\nfirm; they were dismayed when they saw their king lying struck to\\nthe heart amid a heap of corpses- for when the son of Saturn made\\nthe fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore\\nstripped the gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son\\nof Menoetius gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Jove lord\\nof the storm-cloud said to Apollo, \"Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you,\\nand take Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black blood\\nfrom off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may wash\\nhim in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortal\\nraiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two fleet messengers,\\nDeath, and Sleep, who will carry him straightway to the rich land\\nof Lycia, where his brothers and kinsmen will inter him, and will\\nraise both mound and pillar to his memory, in due honour to the dead.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father\\'s saying, and came down from\\nthe heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he took\\nSarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way\\noff, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosia\\nand clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him to\\nthe arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who presently\\nset him down in the rich land of Lycia. \\n\\nMeanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to Automedon,\\npursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and foolishness of his\\nheart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son of Peleus, he would\\nhave, escaped death and have been scatheless; but the counsels of\\nJove pass man\\'s understanding; he will put even a brave man to flight\\nand snatch victory from his grasp, or again he will set him on to\\nfight, as he now did when he put a high spirit into the heart of Patroclus.\\n\\nWho then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when\\nthe gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus, Autonous,\\nEcheclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and Melanippus; after\\nthese he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes. These he slew, but the\\nrest saved themselves by flight. \\n\\nThe sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands of\\nPatroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not Phoebus Apollo\\ntaken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to aid the\\nTrojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the high wall,\\nand thrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield with his\\nown immortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god for yet\\na fourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said,\\n\"Draw back, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city of\\nthe Trojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of Achilles who is\\na far better man than you are.\" On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew\\nto some distance and avoided the anger of Apollo. \\n\\nMeanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean gates,\\nin doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or to call\\nthe army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo\\ndrew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius,\\nwho was Hector\\'s uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of Dymas\\nwho lived in Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; in his\\nlikeness Jove\\'s son Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, \"Hector, why\\nhave you left off fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as much\\nbetter a man than you, as I am worse, you should soon rue your slackness.\\nDrive straight towards Patroclus, if so be that Apollo may grant you\\na triumph over him, and you may rull him.\" \\n\\nWith this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade\\nCebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them,\\nand struck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector\\nand the Trojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no\\nman, but drove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his\\nchariot to the ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right\\na jagged stone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and\\nthrew it, nor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was\\nnot in vain, for the stone struck Cebriones, Hector\\'s charioteer,\\na bastard son of Priam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone\\nhit him on the forehead and drove his brows into his head for the\\nbone was smashed, and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He\\ndropped dead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there\\nwas no more life left in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O knight\\nPatroclus, saying, \"Bless my heart, how active he is, and how well\\nhe dives. If we had been at sea this fellow would have dived from\\nthe ship\\'s side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could\\nstomach, even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his\\nchariot on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are divers also\\namong the Trojans.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it were,\\nof a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struck in the\\nchest, and his courage is his own bane- even so furiously, O Patroclus,\\ndid you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also from his chariot\\nto the ground. The pair then fought over the body of Cebriones. As\\ntwo lions fight fiercely on some high mountain over the body of a\\nstag that they have killed, even so did these two mighty warriors,\\nPatroclus son of Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another\\nover the corpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let him go when he\\nhad once got him by the head, while Patroclus kept fast hold of his\\nfeet, and a fierce fight raged between the other Danaans and Trojans.\\nAs the east and south wind buffet one another when they beat upon\\nsome dense forest on the mountains- there is beech and ash and spreading\\ncornel; the to of the trees roar as they beat on one another, and\\none can hear the boughs cracking and breaking- even so did the Trojans\\nand Achaeans spring upon one another and lay about each other, and\\nneither side would give way. Many a pointed spear fell to ground and\\nmany a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about the body of Cebriones;\\nmany a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought\\naround his body, but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust,\\nall huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now. \\n\\nSo long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of either\\nside were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he went down\\ntowards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved to\\nbe beyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out of\\nrange of the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the armour\\nfrom his shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce intent\\nand a terrific shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill nine\\nmen; but as he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O Patroclus,\\nwas the hour of your end approaching, for Phoebus fought you in fell\\nearnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about in the crush,\\nfor he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck him from\\nbehind on his back and his broad shoulders with the flat of his hand,\\nso that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat the helmet from\\noff his head, and it rolled rattling off under the horses\\' feet, where\\nits horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust and blood. Never\\nindeed had that helmet fared so before, for it had served to protect\\nthe head and comely forehead of the godlike hero Achilles. Now, however,\\nZeus delivered it over to be worn by Hector. Nevertheless the end\\nof Hector also was near. The bronze-shod spear, so great and so strong,\\nwas broken in the hand of Patroclus, while his shield that covered\\nhim from head to foot fell to the ground as did also the band that\\nheld it, and Apollo undid the fastenings of his corslet.\\n\\nOn this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he stood\\nas one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, the best\\nspearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner,\\ncame behind him and struck him in the back with a spear, midway between\\nthe shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had come up with his chariot\\nhad dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of\\nwar- he it was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove a weapon into\\nyou, but he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then ran back into\\nthe crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would\\nnot stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed though he now was,\\nto attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god had\\ngiven him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men\\nin fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to be wounded and\\ngiving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and when close up\\nwith him struck him in the lower part of the belly with a spear, driving\\nthe bronze point right through it, so that he fell heavily to the\\nground to the great of the Achaeans. As when a lion has fought some\\nfierce wild-boar and worsted him- the two fight furiously upon the\\nmountains over some little fountain at which they would both drink,\\nand the lion has beaten the boar till he can hardly breathe- even\\nso did Hector son of Priam take the life of the brave son of Menoetius\\nwho had killed so many, striking him from close at hand, and vaunting\\nover him the while. \"Patroclus,\" said he, \"you deemed that you should\\nsack our city, rob our Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them\\noff in your ships to your own country. Fool; Hector and his fleet\\nhorses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I am foremost\\nof all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage from off them;\\nas for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles\\nwith all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I ween when you\\nleft him he charged you straitly saying, \\'Come not back to the ships,\\nknight Patroclus, till you have rent the bloodstained shirt of murderous\\nHector about his body. Thus I ween did he charge you, and your fool\\'s\\nheart answered him \\'yea\\' within you.\" \\n\\nThen, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight Patroclus:\\n\"Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn and Apollo\\nhave vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished me so\\neasily, and they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders; had\\ntwenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen\\nbefore my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and\\namong mortal men Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in the killing\\nof me. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, you too shall\\nlive but for a little season; death and the day of your doom are close\\nupon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles son of\\nAeacus.\" \\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul left\\nhis body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad\\nfate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead\\nthough he was, Hector still spoke to him saying, \"Patroclus, why should\\nyou thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis,\\nmay be smitten by my spear and die before me?\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his\\nfoot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He\\nthen went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet descendant\\nof Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which\\nthe gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him swiftly from\\nthe field. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XVII\\n\\nBrave Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had\\nfallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armour\\nto bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even\\nso did yellow-haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his round\\nshield and his spear in front of him, resolute to kill any who should\\ndare face him. But the son of Panthous had also noted the body, and\\ncame up to Menelaus saying, \"Menelaus, son of Atreus, draw back, leave\\nthe body, and let the bloodstained spoils be. I was first of the Trojans\\nand their brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, let me, therefore,\\nhave my full glory among the Trojans, or I will take aim and kill\\nyou.\" \\n\\nTo this Menelaus answered in great anger \"By father Jove, boasting\\nis an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savage\\nwild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures,\\nthan are the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out\\nthe days of his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming\\nme the meanest soldier among the Danaans. His own feet never bore\\nhim back to gladden his wife and parents. Even so shall I make an\\nend of you too, if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and\\ndo not face me, or it shall be worse for you. Even a fool may be wise\\nafter the event.\" \\n\\nEuphorbus would not listen, and said, \"Now indeed, Menelaus, shall\\nyou pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whose\\nwife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought grief unspeakable\\non his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if I bring your\\nhead and armour and place them in the hands of Panthous and noble\\nPhrontis. The time is come when this matter shall be fought out and\\nsettled, for me or against me.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear did\\nnot go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus then took\\naim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawing back,\\nand Menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaning his\\nwhole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point went\\nclean through his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him as\\nhe fell heavily to the ground. His hair which was like that of the\\nGraces, and his locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold,\\nwere all bedrabbled with blood. As one who has grown a fine young\\nolive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water- the\\nplant is full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from every\\nquarter it puts forth its white blossoms till the blasts of some fierce\\nhurricane sweep down upon it and level it with the ground- even so\\ndid Menelaus strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour after he\\nhad slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride\\nof his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is feeding-\\nfirst he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then gorges on\\nher blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry against\\nhim, but they stand aloof and will not come close to him, for they\\nare pale with fear- even so no one had the courage to face valiant\\nMenelaus. The son of Atreus would have then carried off the armour\\nof the son of Panthous with ease, had not Phoebus Apollo been angry,\\nand in the guise of Mentes chief of the Cicons incited Hector to attack\\nhim. \"Hector,\" said he, \"you are now going after the horses of the\\nnoble son of Aeacus, but you will not take them; they cannot be kept\\nin hand and driven by mortal man, save only by Achilles, who is son\\nto an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus son of Atreus has bestridden\\nthe body of Patroclus and killed the noblest of the Trojans, Euphorbus\\nson of Panthous, so that he can fight no more.\" \\n\\nThe god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of\\nHector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranks\\nand saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowing\\nfrom his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour. On this\\nhe made his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming\\narmour, and crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heard\\nhim, he said to himself in his dismay, \"Alas! what shall I do? I may\\nnot let the Trojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallen fighting\\non my behalf, lest some Danaan who sees me should cry shame upon me.\\nStill if for my honour\\'s sake I fight Hector and the Trojans single-handed,\\nthey will prove too many for me, for Hector is bringing them up in\\nforce. Why, however, should I thus hesitate? When a man fights in\\ndespite of heaven with one whom a god befriends, he will soon rue\\nit. Let no Danaan think ill of me if I give place to Hector, for the\\nhand of heaven is with him. Yet, if I could find Ajax, the two of\\nus would fight Hector and heaven too, if we might only save the body\\nof Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus. This, of many evils would\\nbe the least.\" \\n\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with Hector\\nat their head; he therefore drew back and left the body, turning about\\nlike some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and men from a\\nstockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he is daunted and slinks\\nsulkily off- even so did Menelaus son of Atreus turn and leave the\\nbody of Patroclus. When among the body of his men, he looked around\\nfor mighty Ajax son of Telamon, and presently saw him on the extreme\\nleft of the fight, cheering on his men and exhorting them to keep\\non fighting, for Phoebus Apollo had spread a great panic among them.\\nHe ran up to him and said, \"Ajax, my good friend, come with me at\\nonce to dead Patroclus, if so be that we may take the body to Achilles-\\nas for his armour, Hector already has it.\" \\n\\nThese words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among the\\nfront ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped Patroclus\\nof his armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take\\nthe body to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with his\\nshield like wall before him, on which Hector withdrew under shelter\\nof his men, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to\\nthe Trojans to take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; Ajax,\\ntherefore, covered the body of Patroclus with his broad shield and\\nbestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if hunters have come\\nupon him in a forest when he is with his little ones- in the pride\\nand fierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they\\ncover his eyes- even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, and\\nby his side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow in\\nhis heart. \\n\\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and rebuked\\nhim sternly. \"Hector,\" said he, \"you make a brave show, but in fight\\nyou are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim to so\\ngreat a reputation. Think how you may now save your town and citadel\\nby the hands of your own people born in Ilius; for you will get no\\nLycians to fight for you, seeing what thanks they have had for their\\nincessant hardships. Are you likely, sir, to do anything to help a\\nman of less note, after leaving Sarpedon, who was at once your guest\\nand comrade in arms, to be the spoil and prey of the Danaans? So long\\nas he lived he did good service both to your city and yourself; yet\\nyou had no stomach to save his body from the dogs. If the Lycians\\nwill listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to its fate. If\\nthe Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays hold\\nof men who are fighting for their country and harassing those who\\nwould attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into Ilius. Could\\nwe get this dead man away and bring him into the city of Priam, the\\nArgives would readily give up the armour of Sarpedon, and we should\\nget his body to boot. For he whose squire has been now killed is the\\nforemost man at the ships of the Achaeans- he and his close-fighting\\nfollowers. Nevertheless you dared not make a stand against Ajax, nor\\nface him, eye to eye, with battle all round you, for he is a braver\\nman than you are.\" \\n\\nHector scowled at him and answered, \"Glaucus, you should know better.\\nI have held you so far as a man of more understanding than any in\\nall Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid of Ajax.\\nI fear neither battle nor the din of chariots, but Jove\\'s will is\\nstronger than ours; Jove at one time makes even a strong man draw\\nback and snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will\\nset him on to fight. Come hither then, my friend, stand by me and\\nsee indeed whether I shall play the coward the whole day through as\\nyou say, or whether I shall not stay some even of the boldest Danaans\\nfrom fighting round the body of Patroclus.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, \"Trojans, Lycians,\\nand Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends, and\\nfight might and main, while I put on the goodly armour of Achilles,\\nwhich I took when I killed Patroclus.\" \\n\\nWith this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men\\nwho were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet got\\nfar. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed\\nhis armour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius and to the\\nTrojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus,\\nwhich the gods had given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his\\nson; but the son did not grow old in his father\\'s armour.\\n\\nWhen Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and\\narming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged his head\\nand muttered to himself saying, \"A! poor wretch, you arm in the armour\\nof a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you reck nothing\\nof the doom that is already close upon you. You have killed his comrade\\nso brave and strong, but it was not well that you should strip the\\narmour from his head and shoulders. I do indeed endow you with great\\nmight now, but as against this you shall not return from battle to\\nlay the armour of the son of Peleus before Andromache.\" \\n\\nThe son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted the\\narmour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, and filled\\nhis whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode in among\\nthe allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemed to\\nall of them like the great son of Peleus himself. He went about among\\nthem and cheered them on- Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, Thersilochus,\\nAsteropaeus, Deisenor and Hippothous, Phorcys, Chromius and Ennomus\\nthe augur. All these did he exhort saying, \"Hear me, allies from other\\ncities who are here in your thousands, it was not in order to have\\na crowd about me that I called you hither each from his several city,\\nbut that with heart and soul you might defend the wives and little\\nones of the Trojans from the fierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress\\nmy people with your food and the presents that make you rich. Therefore\\nturn, and charge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the game of war;\\nwhoever shall bring Patroclus, dead though he be, into the hands of\\nthe Trojans, and shall make Ajax give way before him, I will give\\nhim one half of the spoils while I keep the other. He will thus share\\nlike honour with myself.\" \\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans\\nwith their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran\\nhigh that he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body-\\nfools that they were, for he was about to take the lives of many.\\nThen Ajax said to Menelaus, \"My good friend Menelaus, you and I shall\\nhardly come out of this fight alive. I am less concerned for the body\\nof Patroclus, who will shortly become meat for the dogs and vultures\\nof Troy, than for the safety of my own head and yours. Hector has\\nwrapped us round in a storm of battle from every quarter, and our\\ndestruction seems now certain. Call then upon the princes of the Danaans\\nif there is any who can hear us.\" \\n\\nMenelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at the\\ntop of his voice. \"My friends,\" he cried, \"princes and counsellors\\nof the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at the\\npublic cost, and give orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafes\\nhim power and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I cannot\\ndistinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden,\\nand think it shame that Patroclus should become meat and morsel for\\nTrojan hounds.\" \\n\\nFleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way\\nthrough the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and Meriones\\nhis esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others that came into\\nthe fight after these, who of his own self could name them?\\n\\nThe Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a great\\nwave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-born river,\\nand the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of the breakers\\nthat beat and buffet them- even with such a roar did the Trojans come\\non; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm about the son\\nof Menoetius, and fenced him with their bronze shields. Jove, moreover,\\nhid the brightness of their helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borne\\nno grudge against the son of Menoetius while he was still alive and\\nsquire to the descendant of Aeacus; therefore he was loth to let him\\nfall a prey to the dogs of his foes the Trojans, and urged his comrades\\non to defend him. \\n\\nAt first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew from\\nthe dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing any one,\\nnevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not lose\\nit long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus\\nalike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and made towards\\nthe front like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands at bay\\nin the forest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths that have\\nattacked him- even so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in among\\nthe phalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who had bestridden Patroclus\\nand were most bent on winning glory by dragging him off to their city.\\nAt this moment Hippothous brave son of the Pelasgian Lethus, in his\\nzeal for Hector and the Trojans, was dragging the body off by the\\nfoot through the press of the fight, having bound a strap round the\\nsinews near the ancle; but a mischief soon befell him from which none\\nof those could save him who would have gladly done so, for the son\\nof Telamon sprang forward and smote him on his bronze-cheeked helmet.\\nThe plumed headpiece broke about the point of the weapon, struck at\\nonce by the spear and by the strong hand of Ajax, so that the bloody\\nbrain came oozing out through the crest-socket. His strength then\\nfailed him and he let Patroclus\\' foot drop from his hand, as he fell\\nfull length dead upon the body; thus he died far from the fertile\\nland of Larissa, and never repaid his parents the cost of bringing\\nhim up, for his life was cut short early by the spear of mighty Ajax.\\nHector then took aim at Ajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and\\njust managed to avoid it; the spear passed on and struck Schedius\\nson of noble Iphitus, captain of the Phoceans, who dwelt in famed\\nPanopeus and reigned over much people; it struck him under the middle\\nof the collar-bone the bronze point went right through him, coming\\nout at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and his armour rang rattling\\nround him as he fell heavily to the ground. Ajax in his turn struck\\nnoble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the middle of the belly as he was\\nbestriding Hippothous, and broke the plate of his cuirass; whereon\\nthe spear tore out his entrails and he clutched the ground in his\\npalm as he fell to earth. Hector and those who were in the front rank\\nthen gave ground, while the Argives raised a loud cry of triumph,\\nand drew off the bodies of Phorcys and Hippothous which they stripped\\npresently of their armour. \\n\\nThe Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and\\ndriven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the Argives,\\nso great was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a triumph\\neven against the will of Jove, if Apollo had not roused Aeneas, in\\nthe likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant who had grown\\nold in the service of Aeneas\\' aged father, and was at all times devoted\\nto him. In his likeness, then, Apollo said, \"Aeneas, can you not manage,\\neven though heaven be against us, to save high Ilius? I have known\\nmen, whose numbers, courage, and self-reliance have saved their people\\nin spite of Jove, whereas in this case he would much rather give victory\\nto us than to the Danaans, if you would only fight instead of being\\nso terribly afraid.\" \\n\\nAeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to\\nHector saying, \"Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on\\nus if we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius through\\nour own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me that Jove\\nthe supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make for the\\nDanaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away dead Patroclus\\nto the ships.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then rallied\\nand again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus son of Arisbas,\\na valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved with pity\\nas he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared Apisaon\\nson of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under the midriff,\\nso that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was the best\\nman of them all after Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forward to avenge\\nhim and attack the Danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch\\nas those about Patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held\\ntheir spears in front of them, for Ajax had given them strict orders\\nthat no man was either to give ground, or to stand out before the\\nothers, but all were to hold well together about the body and fight\\nhand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth ran red with\\nblood as the corpses fell thick on one another alike on the side of\\nthe Trojans and allies, and on that of the Danaans; for these last,\\ntoo, fought no bloodless fight though many fewer of them perished,\\nthrough the care they took to defend and stand by one another.\\n\\nThus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though\\nit had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden\\nover all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the\\ndead son of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought\\nat their ease in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them,\\nand there was not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain.\\nThese last moreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting,\\nfor they were some distance apart and beyond the range of one another\\'s\\nweapons, whereas those who were in the thick of the fray suffered\\nboth from battle and darkness. All the best of them were being worn\\nout by the great weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes,\\nThrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of Patroclus,\\nand believed him to be still alive and leading the van against the\\nTrojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve against the death\\nor rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered when he sent\\nthem from the ships into battle. \\n\\nThus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the sweat\\nof their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on their hands\\nand eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son of Peleus.\\nIt was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat to\\nhis men, and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in\\na ring and tug till the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for\\nthe many that pull at it, and it is well stretched- even so did the\\ntwo sides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass\\nof but a little space- the Trojans steadfastly set on drag ing it\\ninto Ilius, while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their\\nships; and fierce was the fight between them. Not Mars himself the\\nlord of hosts, nor yet Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make\\nlight of such a battle. \\n\\nSuch fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordain\\nround the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not know that\\nhe had fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way\\noff the ships. He had no idea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead,\\nand deemed that he would return alive as soon as he had gone close\\nup to the gates. He knew that he was not to sack the city neither\\nwith nor without himself, for his mother had often told him this when\\nhe had sat alone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels\\nof great Jove. Now, however, she had not told him how great a disaster\\nhad befallen him in the death of the one who was far dearest to him\\nof all his comrades. \\n\\nThe others still kept on charging one another round the body with\\ntheir pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say, \"My\\nfriends, we can never again show our faces at the ships- better, and\\ngreatly better, that earth should open and swallow us here in this\\nplace, than that we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearing\\noff Patroclus to their city.\" \\n\\nThe Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying, \"Friends,\\nthough we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrink from fighting.\"\\nWith such words did they exhort each other. They fought and fought,\\nand an iron clank rose through the void air to the brazen vault of\\nheaven. The horses of the descendant of Aeacus stood out of the fight\\nand wept when they heard that their driver had been laid low by the\\nhand of murderous Hector. Automedon, valiant son of Diores, lashed\\nthem again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and\\nmany a time did he upbraid them, but they would neither go back to\\nthe ships by the waters of the broad Hellespont, nor yet into battle\\namong the Achaeans; they stood with their chariot stock still, as\\na pillar set over the tomb of some dead man or woman, and bowed their\\nheads to the ground. Hot tears fell from their eyes as they mourned\\nthe loss of their charioteer, and their noble manes drooped all wet\\nfrom under the yokestraps on either side the yoke. \\n\\nThe son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He wagged\\nhis head, and muttered to himself, saying, \"Poor things, why did we\\ngive you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are yourselves\\nageless and immortal? Was it that you might share the sorrows that\\nbefall mankind? for of all creatures that live and move upon the earth\\nthere is none so pitiable as he is- still, Hector son of Priam shall\\ndrive neither you nor your chariot. I will not have it. It is enough\\nthat he should have the armour over which he vaunts so vainly. Furthermore\\nI will give you strength of heart and limb to bear Automedon safely\\nto the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojans triumph still\\nfurther, and go on killing till they reach the ships; whereon night\\nshall fall and darkness overshadow the land.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so that\\nthey shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariot\\nswiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behind\\nthem fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture\\namid a flock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed\\nhe dashed amid the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of\\nhis pursuit he killed no man, for he could not wield his spear and\\nkeep his horses in hand when alone in the chariot; at last, however,\\na comrade, Alcimedon, son of Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of\\nhim and came up behind his chariot. \"Automedon,\" said he, \"what god\\nhas put this folly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind,\\nthat you fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed? He who\\nwas your comrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed\\nin the armour of the descendant of Aeacus.\" \\n\\nAutomedon son of Diores answered, \"Alcimedon, there is no one else\\nwho can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can,\\nsave only Patroclus- while he was alive- peer of gods in counsel.\\nTake then the whip and reins, while I go down from the car and fight.\\n\\nAlcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and reins,\\nwhile Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw him he said\\nto Aeneas who was near him, \"Aeneas, counsellor of the mail-clad Trojans,\\nI see the steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus come into battle with\\nweak hands to drive them. I am sure, if you think well, that we might\\ntake them; they will not dare face us if we both attack them.\"\\n\\nThe valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair went\\nright on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dry\\nox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also\\nwith them, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill\\nthe men and capture the horses- fools that they were, for they were\\nnot to return scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed\\nto father Jove and was forthwith filled with courage and strength\\nabounding. He turned to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said, \"Alcimedon,\\nkeep your horses so close up that I may feel their breath upon my\\nback; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son of Priam till he has\\nkilled us and mounted behind the horses; he will then either spread\\npanic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himself be killed among\\nthe foremost.\" \\n\\nOn this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, \"Ajaxes captains\\nof the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to them that\\nare best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us living; for\\nHector and Aeneas who are the two best men among the Trojans, are\\npressing us hard in the full tide of war. Nevertheless the issue lies\\non the lap of heaven, I will therefore hurl my spear and leave the\\nrest to Jove.\" \\n\\nHe poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the round\\nshield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed\\nit not, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part\\nof his belly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow\\nbehind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its\\nneck so that it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus\\ngive one bound and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his\\nbody till it made an end of him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon\\nbut he saw it coming and stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew\\npast him and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went\\non quivering till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then have\\nfought hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced their\\nway through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and parted\\nthem for all their fury- for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius were afraid\\nand drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to the heart. Automedon,\\npeer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of his armour and vaunted over\\nhim saying, \"I have done little to assuage my sorrow for the son of\\nMenoetius, for the man I have killed is not so good as he was.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon his\\nchariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all steeped\\nin gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull. \\n\\nAnd now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, for\\nMinerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command of\\nfar-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encourage\\nthe Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token\\nto mankind either of war or of the chill storms that stay men from\\ntheir labour and plague the flocks- even so, wrapped in such radiant\\nraiment, did Minerva go in among the host and speak man by man to\\neach. First she took the form and voice of Phoenix and spoke to Menelaus\\nson of Atreus, who was standing near her. \"Menelaus,\" said she, \"it\\nwill be shame and dishonour to you, if dogs tear the noble comrade\\nof Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and urge\\nyour men to be so also.\" \\n\\nMenelaus answered, \"Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva vouchsafe\\nme strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall I stand by\\nPatroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, but Hector\\nis as a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, for Jove\\nis now granting him a time of triumph.\" \\n\\nMinerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the\\nother gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders,\\nand made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet come\\nagain and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man\\'s blood- even\\nso bold as this did she make him as he stood over Patroclus and threw\\nhis spear. Now there was among the Trojans a man named Podes, son\\nof Eetion, who was both rich and valiant. Hector held him in the highest\\nhonour for he was his comrade and boon companion; the spear of Menelaus\\nstruck this man in the girdle just as he had turned in flight, and\\nwent right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward, and Menelaus\\nson of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of\\nhis own people. \\n\\nApollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the\\nlikeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the\\nmost favoured of all Hector\\'s guests. In his likeness Apollo said,\\n\"Hector, who of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you\\nhave quailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier?\\nYet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, and\\nhas slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podes\\nson of Eetion. \\n\\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made his\\nway to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of Saturn seized\\nhis bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sent forth\\nhis lightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis he gave\\nvictory to the Trojans and routed the Achaeans. \\n\\nThe panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping his\\nface turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear on the\\nupper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazed\\nthe top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck him\\nfrom close at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitus son\\nof noble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from\\nfighting further. He looked about him in dismay, knowing that never\\nagain should he wield spear in battle with the Trojans. While Hector\\nwas in pursuit of Leitus, Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate\\nover his chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft,\\nand the Trojans cheered aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son\\nof Deucalion as he was standing on his chariot, and very narrowly\\nmissed him, but the spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer\\nof Meriones who had come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left\\nthe ships on foot and would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans\\nif Coiranus had not driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought\\nlife and rescue to Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of murderous\\nHector. For Hector hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the\\nspear drove out his teeth and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that\\nhe fell from his chariot and let the reins fall to the ground. Meriones\\ngathered them up from the ground and took them into his own hands,\\nthen he said to Idomeneus, \"Lay on, till you get back to the ships,\\nfor you must see that the day is no longer ours.\" \\n\\nOn this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had taken\\nhold upon him. \\n\\nAjax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour of\\nthe Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. \"Alas,\" said he, \"even a\\nfool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All their weapons\\nstrike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or a coward that\\nhurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one of them\\nwithout effect. What, then, will be best both as regards rescuing\\nthe body, and our return to the joy of our friends who will be grieving\\nas they look hitherwards; for they will make sure that nothing can\\nnow check the terrible hands of Hector, and that he will fling himself\\nupon our ships. I wish that some one would go and tell the son of\\nPeleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heard the sad news\\nthat the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I can see not a man\\namong the Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike\\nhidden in darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from over the sons\\nof the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you will that\\nwe perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.\" \\n\\nFather Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwith\\nhe chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out and\\nall the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, \"Look,\\nMenelaus, and if Antilochus son of Nestor be still living, send him\\nat once to tell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his\\ncomrades has fallen.\" \\n\\nMenelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a stockyard-\\nthe lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keep watch\\nthe whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat of their\\nherd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain, for\\ndarts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunt\\nhim for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away-\\neven so did Menelaus sorely against his will leave Patroclus, in great\\nfear lest the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fall\\ninto the hands of the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes\\nstraitly saying, \"Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, now\\nindeed remember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous while\\nalive, bear it in mind now that he is dead.\" \\n\\nWith this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an eagle,\\nwhose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird- however\\nhigh he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape him\\nby crouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it\\nand make an end of it- even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes range\\nround the mighty host of your followers to see if you could find the\\nson of Nestor still alive. Presently Menelaus saw him on the extreme\\nleft of the battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fight\\nboldly. Menelaus went up to him and said, \"Antilochus, come here and\\nlisten to sad news, which I would indeed were untrue. You must see\\nwith your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans,\\nand giving victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was the\\nbravest of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Run\\ninstantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescue\\nthe body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector already\\nhas it.\" \\n\\nAntilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was speechless;\\nhis eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance, but he\\ndid as Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he had given\\nhis armour to a comrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horses round,\\nclose beside him. \\n\\nThus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad news\\nto Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded to succour\\nhis harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians- and greatly\\ndid they miss him- but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and himself\\nwent back to Patroclus. He came running up to the two Ajaxes and said,\\n\"I have sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, but rage against\\nHector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight without armour.\\nWhat then will be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead,\\nand our own escape from death amid the battle-cries of the Trojans?\"\\n\\nAjax answered, \"Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and Meriones\\nstoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray, while we\\ntwo behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in heart as in\\nname, and long used to fighting side by side with one another.\"\\n\\nOn this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and\\nlifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised\\na hue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the body\\naway, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at\\nthe loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at\\nhim as though they would tear him in pieces, but now and again he\\nturns on them in a fury, scaring and scattering them in all directions-\\neven so did the Trojans for a while charge in a body, striking with\\nsword and with spears pointed ai both the ends, but when the two Ajaxes\\nfaced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no man dared\\npress on to fight further about the dead. \\n\\nIn this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the body\\nto the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them like fierce\\nflames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city, and\\nthe houses fall in the glare of its burning- even such was the roar\\nand tramp of men and horses that pursued them as they bore Patroclus\\nfrom the field. Or as mules that put forth all their strength to draw\\nsome beam or great piece of ship\\'s timber down a rough mountain-track,\\nand they pant and sweat as they, go even so did Menelaus and pant\\nand sweat as they bore the body of Patroclus. Behind them the two\\nAjaxes held stoutly out. As some wooded mountain-spur that stretches\\nacross a plain will turn water and check the flow even of a great\\nriver, nor is there any stream strong enough to break through it-\\neven so did the two Ajaxes face the Trojans and stern the tide of\\ntheir fighting though they kept pouring on towards them and foremost\\namong them all was Aeneas son of Anchises with valiant Hector. As\\na flock of daws or starlings fall to screaming and chattering when\\nthey see a falcon, foe to i\\'ll small birds, come soaring near them,\\neven so did the Achaean youth raise a babel of cries as they fled\\nbefore Aeneas and Hector, unmindful of their former prowess. In the\\nrout of the Danaans much goodly armour fell round about the trench,\\nand of fighting there was no end. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XVIII\\n\\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the\\nfleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached Achilles,\\nand found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that which was\\nindeed too surely true. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness\\nof his heart, \"why are the Achaeans again scouring the plain and flocking\\ntowards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not now bringing that\\nsorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, saying that while\\nI was yet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fall before the\\nTrojans, and see the light of the sun no longer. I fear the brave\\nson of Menoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet I bade\\nhim return to the ships as soon as he had driven back those that were\\nbringing fire against them, and not join battle with Hector.\"\\n\\nAs he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and told\\nhis sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. \"Alas,\" he cried, \"son of\\nnoble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that they were\\nuntrue. Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about his naked\\nbody- for Hector holds his armour.\" \\n\\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filled\\nboth hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,\\ndisfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over his\\nshirt so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely at\\nfull length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom\\nAchilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,\\nbeating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.\\nAntilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his hands\\nas he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into\\nhis own throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard\\nhim as she was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her\\nfather, whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus\\nthat dwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There\\nwere Glauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, thoe and dark-eyed\\nHalie, Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe and\\nAgave, Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and\\nCallianeira, Doris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes,\\nApseudes and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeira and Ianassa,\\nMaera, Oreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids\\nwho dwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was filled with\\ntheir multitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them\\nin their lament. \\n\\n\"Listen,\" she cried, \"sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may hear\\nthe burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I have borne\\nthe most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, hero among\\nheroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plant in a\\ngoodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans,\\nbut never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long\\nas he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is in heaviness,\\nand though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I will go,\\nthat I may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallen him\\nthough he is still holding aloof from battle.\" \\n\\nShe left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping\\nafter, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached\\nthe rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line\\non to the sands, at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons were\\ndrawn up in close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother went\\nup to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and\\nspoke piteously, saying, \"My son, why are you thus weeping? What sorrow\\nhas now befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jove has\\ngranted you the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands\\nand besought him that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up at\\ntheir ships, and rue it bitterly in that you were no longer with them.\"\\n\\nAchilles groaned and answered, \"Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed vouchsafed\\nme the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me, seeing that\\nmy dear comrade Patroclus has fallen- he whom I valued more than all\\nothers, and loved as dearly as my own life? I have lost him; aye,\\nand Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrous armour, so\\nglorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when they laid you\\nin the couch of a mortal man. Would that you were still dwelling among\\nthe immortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken to himself some\\nmortal bride. For now you shall have grief infinite by reason of the\\ndeath of that son whom you can never welcome home- nay, I will not\\nlive nor go about among mankind unless Hector fall by my spear, and\\nthus pay me for having slain Patroclus son of Menoetius.\"\\n\\nThetis wept and answered, \"Then, my son, is your end near at hand-\\nfor your own death awaits you full soon after that of Hector.\"\\n\\nThen said Achilles in his great grief, \"I would die here and now,\\nin that I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home,\\nand in his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is\\nthere for me? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought\\nno saving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so\\nmany have been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootless\\nburden upon the earth, I, who in fight have no peer among the Achaeans,\\nthough in council there are better than I. Therefore, perish strife\\nboth from among gods and men, and anger, wherein even a righteous\\nman will harden his heart- which rises up in the soul of a man like\\nsmoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey. Even\\nso has Agamemnon angered me. And yet- so be it, for it is over; I\\nwill force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will\\npursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will then\\nabide my doom when it may please Jove and the other gods to send it.\\nEven Hercules, the best beloved of Jove- even he could not escape\\nthe hand of death, but fate and Juno\\'s fierce anger laid him low,\\nas I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom awaits me. Till then\\nI will win fame, and will bid Trojan and Dardanian women wring tears\\nfrom their tender cheeks with both their hands in the grievousness\\nof their great sorrow; thus shall they know that he who has held aloof\\nso long will hold aloof no longer. Hold me not back, therefore, in\\nthe love you bear me, for you shall not move me.\" \\n\\nThen silver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, what you have said is\\ntrue. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but your\\narmour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph\\nupon his own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not\\nbe lasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the\\npress of battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break\\nof day I shall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from King\\nVulcan.\" \\n\\nOn this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to\\nthe sea-nymphs her sisters, \"Dive into the bosom of the sea and go\\nto the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as\\nfor me, I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and\\nask him to provide my son with a suit of splendid armour.\"\\n\\nWhen she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves, while\\nsilver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the armour\\nfor her son. \\n\\nThus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and meanwhile\\nthe Achaeans were flying with loud cries before murderous Hector till\\nthey reached the ships and the Hellespont, and they could not draw\\nthe body of Mars\\'s servant Patroclus out of reach of the weapons that\\nwere showered upon him, for Hector son of Priam with his host and\\nhorsemen had again caught up to him like the flame of a fiery furnace;\\nthrice did brave Hector seize him by the feet, striving with might\\nand main to draw him away and calling loudly on the Trojans, and thrice\\ndid the two Ajaxes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him\\nfrom off the body; but all undaunted he would now charge into the\\nthick of the fight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud,\\nbut he would give no ground. As upland shepherds that cannot chase\\nsome famished lion from a carcase, even so could not the two Ajaxes\\nscare Hector son of Priam from the body of Patroclus. \\n\\nAnd now he would even have dragged it off and have won imperishable\\nglory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her way as messenger\\nfrom Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. She came secretly\\nwithout the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, for Juno sent\\nher, and when she had got close to him she said, \"Up, son of Peleus,\\nmightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom this fearful\\nfight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another, the\\nDanaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans are trying\\nto hale it away, and take it to wind Ilius: Hector is the most furious\\nof them all; he is for cutting the head from the body and fixing it\\non the stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink\\nfrom the thought that Patroclus may become meat for the dogs of Troy.\\nShame on you, should his body suffer any kind of outrage.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles said, \"Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you to\\nme?\" \\n\\nIris answered, \"It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son\\nof Saturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of the\\nimmortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus.\" \\n\\nThen fleet Achilles answered her saying, \"How can I go up into the\\nbattle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I should\\nsee her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from Vulcan;\\nI know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of Ajax\\nson of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front rank and\\nwielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus.\" \\n\\nIris said, \\'We know that your armour has been taken, but go as you\\nare; go to the deep trench and show yourelf before the Trojans, that\\nthey may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons\\nof the Achaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle may\\nhardly be.\" \\n\\nIris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove arose,\\nand Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong shoulders;\\nshe crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which she kindled\\na glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into heaven from\\nsome city that is being beleaguered on an island far out at sea- all\\nday long do men sally from the city and fight their hardest, and at\\nthe going down of the sun the line of beacon-fires blazes forth, flaring\\nhigh for those that dwell near them to behold, if so be that they\\nmay come with their ships and succour them- even so did the light\\nflare from the head of Achilles, as he stood by the trench, going\\nbeyond the wall- but he aid not join the Achaeans for he heeded the\\ncharge which his mother laid upon him. \\n\\nThere did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice\\nfrom afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing\\nas the note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the\\ngates of a city, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus,\\nand when the Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the\\nhorses turned back with their chariots for they boded mischief, and\\ntheir drivers were awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyed\\ngoddess had kindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.\\n\\nThrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,\\nand thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into confusion;\\nwhereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath the wheels\\nof their chariots and perished by their own spears. The Achaeans to\\ntheir great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of the weapons, and\\nlaid him on a litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, and among\\nthem fleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying\\ndead upon his bier. He had sent him out with horses and chariots into\\nbattle, but his return he was not to welcome. \\n\\nThen Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters of\\nOceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and turmoil\\nof war. \\n\\nNow the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked their\\nhorses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. They\\nkept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallen\\nupon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having held\\naloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first to\\nspeak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both before\\nand after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon the\\nsame night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed\\nthem thus:- \\n\\n\"Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to your\\ncity and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are far from\\nour walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnon the Achaeans\\nwere easier to deal with, and I would have gladly camped by the ships\\nin the hope of taking them; but now I go in great fear of the fleet\\nson of Peleus; he is so daring that he will never bide here on the\\nplain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fight with equal valour, but\\nhe will try to storm our city and carry off our women. Do then as\\nI say, and let us retreat. For this is what will happen. The darkness\\nof night will for a time stay the son of Peleus, but if he find us\\nhere in the morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall\\nhave knowledge of him in good earnest. Glad indeed will he be who\\ncan escape and get back to Ilius, and many a Trojan will become meat\\nfor dogs and vultures may I never live to hear it. If we do as I say,\\nlittle though we may like it, we shall have strength in counsel during\\nthe night, and the great gates with the doors that close them will\\nprotect the city. At dawn we can arm and take our stand on the walls;\\nhe will then rue it if he sallies from the ships to fight us. He will\\ngo back when he has given his horses their fill of being driven all\\nwhithers under our walls, and will be in no mind to try and force\\nhis way into the city. Neither will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour\\nhim ere he do so.\" \\n\\nHector looked fiercely at him and answered, \"Polydamas, your words\\nare not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within\\nthe city. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls?\\nIn the old-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over\\nfor its wealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out\\nof our houses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair\\nMeonia, for the hand of Jove has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,\\nthat the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here\\nand to hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this fool\\'s\\nwise among the people. You will have no man with you; it shall not\\nbe; do all of you as I now say;- take your suppers in your companies\\nthroughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful every man\\nof you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let him gather\\nthem and give them out among the people. Better let these, rather\\nthan the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm and fight about\\nthe ships; granted that Achilles has again come forward to defend\\nthem, let it be as he will, but it shall go hard with him. I shall\\nnot shun him, but will fight him, to fall or conquer. The god of war\\ndeals out like measure to all, and the slayer may yet be slain.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted\\nin applause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding.\\nThey gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words\\nof Polydamas no man would heed. They took their supper throughout\\nthe host, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mourned\\nPatroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid\\nhis murderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again\\nand again as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed\\nhim of his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he\\nis furious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he\\ncan find him, for he is mad with rage- even so with many a sigh did\\nAchilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, \"Alas! vain were the words\\nwith which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said that\\nI would bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked\\nIlius and taken his share of the spoils- but Jove does not give all\\nmen their heart\\'s desire. The same soil shall be reddened here at\\nTroy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomed home\\nby the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in this\\nplace shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, now that\\nI am left behind you, I will not bury you, till I have brought hither\\nthe head and armour of mighty Hector who has slain you. Twelve noble\\nsons of Trojans will I behead before your bier to avenge you; till\\nI have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships, and fair women\\nof Troy and Dardanus, whom we have taken with spear and strength of\\narm when we sacked men\\'s goodly cities, shall weep over you both night\\nand day.\" \\n\\nThen Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire that\\nthey might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon they\\nset a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw sticks\\non to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played\\nabout the belly of the tripod. When the water in the cauldron was\\nboiling they washed the body, anointed it with oil, and closed its\\nwounds with ointment that had been kept nine years. Then they laid\\nit on a bier and covered it with a linen cloth from head to foot,\\nand over this they laid a fair white robe. Thus all night long did\\nthe Myrmidons gather round Achilles to mourn Patroclus. \\n\\nThen Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, \"So, Queen Juno, you have\\ngained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think that\\nthe Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.\" \\n\\nAnd Juno answered, \"Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this thing?\\nMay not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we do,\\ndo what he can for another person? And shall not I- foremost of all\\ngoddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign in heaven-\\ndevise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?\" \\n\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of Vulcan,\\nimperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in heaven, a\\nhouse of bronze wrought by the lame god\\'s own hands. She found him\\nbusy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making\\ntwenty tripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, and he\\nset wheels of gold under them all that they might go of their own\\nselves to the assemblies of the gods, and come back again- marvels\\nindeed to see. They were finished all but the ears of cunning workmanship\\nwhich yet remained to be fixed to them: these he was now fixing, and\\nhe was hammering at the rivets. While he was thus at work silver-footed\\nThetis came to the house. Charis, of graceful head-dress, wife to\\nthe far-famed lame god, came towards her as soon as she saw her, and\\ntook her hand in her own, saying, \"Why have you come to our house,\\nThetis, honoured and ever welcome- for you do not visit us often?\\nCome inside and let me set refreshment before you.\" \\n\\nThe goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a richly\\ndecorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under\\nher feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, \"Vulcan, come here, Thetis\\nwants you\"; and the far-famed lame god answered, \"Then it is indeed\\nan august and honoured goddess who has come here; she it was that\\ntook care of me when I was suffering from the heavy fall which I had\\nthrough my cruel mother\\'s anger- for she would have got rid of me\\nbecause I was lame. It would have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome,\\ndaughter of the ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, and Thetis, taken\\nme to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them, and many beautiful\\nworks in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups, and chains, did I\\nmake for them in their cave, with the roaring waters of Oceanus foaming\\nas they rushed ever past it; and no one knew, neither of gods nor\\nmen, save only Thetis and Eurynome who took care of me. If, then,\\nThetis has come to my house I must make her due requital for having\\nsaved me; entertain her, therefore, with all hospitality, while I\\nput by my bellows and all my tools.\" \\n\\nOn this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legs\\nplying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, and\\ngathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge and\\nwashed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donned\\nhis shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door.\\nThere were golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like\\nreal young women, with sense and reason, voice also and strength,\\nand all the learning of the immortals; these busied themselves as\\nthe king bade them, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon\\na goodly seat, and took her hand in his own, saying, \"Why have you\\ncome to our house, Thetis honoured and ever welcome- for you do not\\nvisit us often? Say what you want, and I will do it for you at once\\nif I can, and if it can be done at all.\" \\n\\nThetis wept and answered, \"Vulcan, is there another goddess in Olympus\\nwhom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so much affliction\\nas he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did he make subject\\nto a mortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorely against my will\\ndid I submit to the embraces of one who was but mortal, and who now\\nstays at home worn out with age. Neither is this all. Heaven vouchsafed\\nme a son, hero among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling. I tended\\nhim as a plant in a goodly garden and sent him with his ships to Ilius\\nto fight the Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house\\nof Peleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun,\\nhe is in heaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him; King\\nAgamemnon has made him give up the maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans\\nhad awarded him, and he wastes with sorrow for her sake. Then the\\nTrojans hemmed the Achaeans in at their ships\\' sterns and would not\\nlet them come forth; the elders, therefore, of the Argives besought\\nAchilles and offered him great treasure, whereon he refused to bring\\ndeliverance to them himself, but put his own armour on Patroclus and\\nsent him into the fight with much people after him. All day long they\\nfought by the Scaean gates and would have taken the city there and\\nthen, had not Apollo vouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant\\nson of Menoetius after he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore\\nI am suppliant at your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide\\nmy son, whose end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly\\ngreaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost\\nhis own when his true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and\\nhe now lies stretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.\"\\n\\nAnd Vulcan answered, \"Take heart, and be no more disquieted about\\nthis matter; would that I could hide him from death\\'s sight when his\\nhour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze\\nthe eyes of all who behold it.\" \\n\\nWhen he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning them\\ntowards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows\\nblew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some\\nfierce to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong\\nas Vulcan willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper\\ninto the fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil\\non its block, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he\\ntook the tongs in the other. \\n\\nFirst he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over\\nand binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and\\nthe baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five thicknesses,\\nand with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it. \\n\\nHe wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her\\nfull and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face\\nof heaven- the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which\\nmen also call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing.\\nOrion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus. \\n\\nHe wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of men.\\nIn the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were going about\\nthe city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight from their\\nchambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the youths danced to the\\nmusic of flute and lyre, while the women stood each at her house door\\nto see them. \\n\\nMeanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a quarrel,\\nand two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man who had\\nbeen killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid damages\\nin full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each was trying\\nto make his own case good, and the people took sides, each man backing\\nthe side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them back, and the\\nelders sate on their seats of stone in a solemn circle, holding the\\nstaves which the heralds had put into their hands. Then they rose\\nand each in his turn gave judgement, and there were two talents laid\\ndown, to be given to him whose judgement should be deemed the fairest.\\n\\nAbout the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming armour,\\nand they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and accept\\nthe half of what it contained. But the men of the city would not yet\\nconsent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives and little\\nchildren kept guard upon the walls, and with them were the men who\\nwere past fighting through age; but the others sallied forth with\\nMars and Pallas Minerva at their head- both of them wrought in gold\\nand clad in golden raiment, great and fair with their armour as befitting\\ngods, while they that followed were smaller. When they reached the\\nplace where they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to which\\nlive stock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here,\\nthen, they lay concealed, clad in full armour. Some way off them there\\nwere two scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or\\ncattle, which presently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing\\non their pipes, and had not so much as a thought of danger. When those\\nwho were in ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds and\\nkilled the shepherds. Meanwhile the besiegers, when they heard much\\nnoise among the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses,\\nand made with all speed towards them; when they reached them they\\nset battle in array by the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed\\ntheir bronze-shod spears at one another. With them were Strife and\\nRiot, and fell Fate who was dragging three men after her, one with\\na fresh wound, and the other unwounded, while the third was dead,\\nand she was dragging him along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled\\nin men\\'s blood. They went in and out with one another and fought as\\nthough they were living people haling away one another\\'s dead.\\n\\nHe wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed already.\\nMany men were working at the plough within it, turning their oxen\\nto and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on reaching\\nthe headland a man would come up to them and give them a cup of wine,\\nand they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the time\\nwhen they should again reach the headland. The part that they had\\nploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though it was of\\ngold, still looked as if it were being ploughed- very curious to behold.\\n\\nHe wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were reaping\\nwith sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to the\\nground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them\\nin bands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind them\\nthere were boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept on bringing\\nthem to be bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by in\\nsilence and was glad. The servants were getting a meal ready under\\nan oak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting\\nhim up, while the women were making a porridge of much white barley\\nfor the labourers\\' dinner. \\n\\nHe wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines\\nwere loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the\\nvines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal\\nall round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one\\npath to it, and by this the vintagers went when they would gather\\nthe vintage. Youths and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried\\nthe luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with them there went a\\nboy who made sweet music with his lyre, and sang the Linus-song with\\nhis clear boyish voice. \\n\\nHe wrought also a herd of homed cattle. He made the cows of gold and\\ntin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go\\nand feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river.\\nAlong with the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold,\\nand their nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had fastened\\non a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as\\nhe might they haled him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions\\ntore through the bull\\'s thick hide and were gorging on his blood and\\nbowels, but the herdsmen were afraid to do anything, and only hounded\\non their dogs; the dogs dared not fasten on the lions but stood by\\nbarking and keeping out of harm\\'s way. \\n\\nThe god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and large\\nflock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.\\n\\nFurthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made\\nin Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths and maidens\\nwhom all would woo, with their hands on one another\\'s wrists. The\\nmaidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts\\nthat were slightly oiled. The girls were crowned with garlands, while\\nthe young men had daggers of gold that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes\\nthey would dance deftly in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it\\nwere a potter sitting at his work and making trial of his wheel to\\nsee whether it will run, and sometimes they would go all in line with\\none another, and much people was gathered joyously about the green.\\nThere was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two\\ntumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck\\nup with his tune. \\n\\nAll round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream\\nof the river Oceanus. \\n\\nThen when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made\\na breastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made helmet,\\nclose fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume\\noverhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin. \\n\\nLastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took it\\nand set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like\\na falcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming\\narmour from the house of Vulcan. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XIX\\n\\nNow when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\\nOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\\nships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\\nfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also\\nof his followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came\\namong them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve\\nas we may we must let this man lie, for it is by heaven\\'s will that\\nhe has fallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly\\narmour, which no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out bravely\\nas she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none dared\\nlook full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\\nstill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for\\nhe was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had\\nmade him. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at\\nit, he said to his mother, \"Mother, the god has given me armour, meet\\nhandiwork for an immortal and such as no living could have fashioned;\\nI will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon the son\\nof Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his body, now\\nhe is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\" \\n\\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not disquieted about this\\nmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\\nflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle.\\nHe may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound\\nas ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;\\nunsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might\\nand main.\" \\n\\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she\\nthen dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus,\\nthat his body might suffer no change. \\n\\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called\\non the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always\\nat the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were\\nabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of assembly\\nbecause Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so long\\nfrom fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus, came\\nlimping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they came,\\nand took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of all\\ncame Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of Antenor\\nhad struck him with a spear in battle. \\n\\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \"Son of\\nAtreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\\nwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would\\nhave been better, had Diana\\'s arrow slain her at the ships on the\\nday when I took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an\\nAchaean the less would have bitten dust before the foe in the days\\nof my anger. It has been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the\\nAchaeans will long indeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let\\nit be, for it is over. If we have been angry, necessity has schooled\\nour anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore,\\nbid the Achaeans arm forthwith that I may go out against the Trojans,\\nand learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep by the ships or\\nno. Glad, I ween, will he be to rest his knees who may fly my spear\\nwhen I wield it.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\\nhis anger. \\n\\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\\nmiddle of the assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of Mars,\\nit is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not\\nseemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised\\nspeaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest\\norator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus,\\nand do you other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the\\nAchaeans spoken to me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was\\nnot I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness\\nstruck me mad when we were assembled on the day that I took from Achilles\\nthe meed that had been awarded to him. What could I do? All things\\nare in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove\\'s daughters,\\nshuts men\\'s eyes to their destruction. She walks delicately, not on\\nthe solid earth, but hovers over the heads of men to make them stumble\\nor to ensnare them. \\n\\n\"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest whether\\nof gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on the\\nday when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair city\\nof Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, \\'Hear me all gods\\nand goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day shall\\nan Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child\\ninto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who\\nare of my blood and lineage.\\' Then said Juno all crafty and full of\\nguile, \\'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear\\nme, O Olympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day\\nfall between the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell\\nabout him who are of your blood and lineage.\\' \\n\\n\"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,\\nto his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit\\nof Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that\\nthe noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with\\nchild and in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though\\nthere was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena,\\nand kept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of\\nSaturn, and said, \\'Father Jove, lord of the lightning- I have a word\\nfor your ear. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son\\nto Sthenelus the son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well,\\ntherefore, that he should reign over the Argives.\\' \\n\\n\"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\\nFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again\\ninvade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then\\nhe whirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down\\nfrom heaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he\\nwas ever angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel\\nlabours that Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty\\nHector was killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I\\nkept thinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove\\nrobbed me of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much\\ntreasure by way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your\\npeople with you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday\\nin your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain\\nfight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship,\\nthat you may see whether what I give you is enough.\" \\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you\\ncan give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them:\\nit is in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not\\nwell to tarry talking about trifles, for there is a deed which is\\nas yet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost,\\nand laying low the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one\\nof you when he is fighting.\" \\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans\\nthus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will\\nbe no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both\\nsides with fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the\\nships, for in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle\\nthe livelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;\\nhowever much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before\\nhe knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will\\ngrow weary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed\\nwith meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay\\ntill he has routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and\\nbid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts\\nin presence of the assembly, that all may see them and you may be\\nsatisfied. Moreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that\\nhe has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her\\nafter the manner of men and women; and do you, too, show yourself\\nof a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with\\na feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full.\\nAs for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future;\\nit is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he\\nwas wrong in the first instance.\" \\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of Laertes, your words please me\\nwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\\nhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the\\nname of heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would\\nfain fight at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come\\nfrom my tent and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do\\nI charge you: take some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from\\nmy tents the gifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring\\nthe women also; furthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those\\nthat are with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and\\nto the sun.\" \\n\\nThen said Achilles, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to\\nthese matters at some other season, when there is breathing time and\\nwhen I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those\\nwhom Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain?\\nLet the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food,\\ntill we have avenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun\\nlet them eat their fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my\\ntent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades\\nare mourning round him. Therefore I can take thought of nothing save\\nonly slaughter and blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the Achaeans,\\nin battle you are better than I, and that more than a little, but\\nin counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater knowledge.\\nTherefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of which\\nmen soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is wars steward, weighs the upshot,\\nit may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped is\\nfar heavier than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should\\nmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold\\ncontinually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let us mourn\\nour dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but let those\\nof us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight our foes\\nmore fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for a second\\nsummons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found lagging\\nbehind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose the\\nfury of war upon the Trojans.\" \\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with\\nMeges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes,\\nand Melanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The\\nword was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out\\nthe seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal\\ncauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled\\nin useful arts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses\\nweighed out the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while\\nthe young Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in\\nthe middle of the assembly. \\n\\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a\\ngod came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which\\nhe wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting\\noff some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as\\nhe did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly\\nto hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and\\nprayed saying, \"I call Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to\\nwitness, I call also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below\\nand take vengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid\\nno hand upon the girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise,\\nbut that she has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely\\nmay heaven visit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those\\nwho perjure themselves.\" \\n\\nHe cut the boar\\'s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it\\nround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes.\\nThen Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, \"Father Jove, of\\na truth you blind men\\'s eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had\\nnot else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken\\nBriseis from me against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled\\nthe destruction of many an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that\\nwe may begin fighting.\" \\n\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\\nship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to\\nthe ship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men\\ndrove the horses in among the others. \\n\\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus,\\nflung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,\\nand her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she\\nwept and said, \"Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left\\nyou living; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\\nmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father\\nand mother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own\\ndear brothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus,\\neven when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,\\ntold me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make Achilles\\nmarry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding\\nfeast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to me and I shall\\nnever cease to grieve for you.\" \\n\\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as\\nthough their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping\\nfor her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles\\nand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"I\\npray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat\\nnor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even\\nto the going down of the sun.\" \\n\\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\\nAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\\nstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:\\nbut he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into\\nthe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\\nPatroclus. Then he said- \\n\\n\"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\\nready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting\\nto fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink\\nin my tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I\\ncould not know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my\\nfather, who is now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who\\nam here fighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake\\nof Helen, nor yet though I should hear that my son is no more- he\\nwho is being brought up in Scyros- if indeed Neoptolemus is still\\nliving. Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy\\naway from Argos, while you were to return to Phthia, bring back my\\nson with you in your own ship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen,\\nand the greatness of my house- for Peleus must surely be either dead,\\nor what little life remains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities\\nof age and ever present fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of\\nmy death.\" \\n\\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought\\non what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down\\nwith pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, \"My child, you\\nhave quite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your\\nrecollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss\\nof his dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner\\nhe will neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia\\ninto his breast, that he may know no hunger.\" \\n\\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\\nShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing\\non his broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\\nthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia\\ninto Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail\\nhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the\\nchill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen\\nblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets,\\nthe bossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen\\nspears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the whole\\nland was radiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the\\ntramp of their treading rose from under their feet. In the midst of\\nthem all Achilles put on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes\\ngleamed like fire, for his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus,\\nthen, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the\\ngod, the armour that Vulcan had made him. \\n\\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next\\nhe did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded\\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so\\ngreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon.\\nAs the light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a\\nfire in their homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors\\nare carried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where\\nthey would be- even so did the gleam of Achilles\\' wondrous shield\\nstrike up into the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and\\nset it upon his head, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden\\nplumes which Vulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved\\nall around it. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to\\nsee whether it fitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under\\nit, and it seemed to buoy him up as though it had been wings.\\n\\nHe also drew his father\\'s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\\ngreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles\\nhad strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the\\ntopmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\\nfraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied themselves\\nwith the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast about\\nthem, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back towards\\nthe chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the horses,\\nand after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as the\\nsun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his father\\'s\\nhorses saying, \"Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring of Podarge- this\\ntime when we have done fighting be sure and bring your driver safely\\nback to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him dead on the\\nplain as you did Patroclus.\" \\n\\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke- for white-armed Juno had\\nendowed him with human speech- and he bowed his head till his mane\\ntouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"Dread\\nAchilles,\" said he, \"we will indeed save you now, but the day of your\\ndeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven\\nand stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth\\nor slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his\\narmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him\\nas he fought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector.\\nWe two can fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of\\nall winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man\\nand of a god.\" \\n\\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\\nanswered him in great sadness, saying, \"Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\\nforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\\nfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\\nshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of fighting.\"\\n\\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XX\\n\\nThus, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son\\nof Peleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over against\\nthem armed upon the rise of the plain. \\n\\nMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis gather\\nthe gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to the\\nhouse of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor a\\nsingle one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of rivers\\nand meadows of green grass. When they reached the house of cloud-compelling\\nJove, they took their seats in the arcades of polished marble which\\nVulcan with his consummate skill had made for father Jove.\\n\\nIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. Neptune\\nalso, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and\\ncame up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of\\nthem, he asked what Jove\\'s purpose might be. \"Why,\" said he, \"wielder\\nof the lightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you considering\\nsome matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans- for the blaze\\nof battle is on the point of being kindled between them?\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore\\nI have called you hither. I take thought for them even in their destruction.\\nFor my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt. Olympus and look on\\nin peace, but do you others go about among Trojans and Achaeans, and\\nhelp either side as you may be severally disposed. If Achilles fights\\nthe Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand against him;\\nthey have ever trembled at the sight of him, and now that he is roused\\nto such fury about his comrade, he will override fate itself and storm\\ntheir city.\" \\n\\nThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took their\\nseveral sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva, earth-encircling\\nNeptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent in all cunning-\\nall these joined the host that came from the ships; with them also\\ncame Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thin legs\\nplying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the Trojans,\\nand with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer goddess Diana,\\nLeto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus. \\n\\nSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the\\nAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight\\nwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him\\nfor fear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his\\narmour, and looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians\\ncame to take their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife,\\nrouser of hosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by\\nthe deep trench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all\\nher might upon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out\\nupon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called\\non the Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and\\nnow speeding up the side of the river Simois till he came to the hill\\nCallicolone. \\n\\nThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce contention\\nalso among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered from heaven\\nabove, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth, and bade the\\nhigh hills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained Ida quaked,\\nas also the city of the Trojans and the ships of the Achaeans. Hades,\\nking of the realms below, was struck with fear; he sprang panic-stricken\\nfrom his throne and cried aloud in terror lest Neptune, lord of the\\nearthquake, should crack the ground over his head, and lay bare his\\nmouldy mansions to the sight of mortals and immortals- mansions so\\nghastly grim that even the gods shudder to think of them. Such was\\nthe uproar as the gods came together in battle. Apollo with his arrows\\ntook his stand to face King Neptune, while Minerva took hers against\\nthe god of war; the archer-goddess Diana with her golden arrows, sister\\nof far-darting Apollo, stood to face Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer\\nof good luck faced Leto, while the mighty eddying river whom men can\\nScamander, but gods Xanthus, matched himself against Vulcan.\\n\\nThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart\\nof Achilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was with\\nhis blood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn\\nlord of battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of\\nPeleus, and put courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of\\nLycaon son of Priam. In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas,\\n\"Aeneas, counsellor of the Trojans, where are now the brave words\\nwith which you vaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes, saying\\nthat you would fight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?\"\\n\\nAnd Aeneas answered, \"Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son of\\nPeleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it\\nwould not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to Right\\nfrom Ida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus;\\nJove indeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to fly, else\\nhad the fallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who went before\\nhim to protect him and urged him to fall upon the Lelegae and Trojans.\\nNo man may fight Achilles, for one of the gods is always with him\\nas his guardian angel, and even were it not so, his weapon flies ever\\nstraight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him who is against\\nhim; if heaven would let me fight him on even terms he should not\\nsoon overcome me, though he boasts that he is made of bronze.\"\\n\\nThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, \"Nay, hero, pray to the ever-living\\ngods, for men say that you were born of Jove\\'s daughter Venus, whereas\\nAchilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is child to Jove,\\nwhile Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea. Bring, therefore,\\nyour spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you with his taunts\\nand menaces.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his people,\\nand he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost fighters.\\nNor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed Juno,\\nas he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called the\\ngods about her, and said, \"Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva,\\nand consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas\\nclad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once,\\nor shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so\\nthat his heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the immortals\\nare on his side, while the others who have all along been defending\\nthe Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come down from Olympus\\nand join in the fight, that this day he may take no hurt at the hands\\nof the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may have spun\\nout for him when he was begotten and his mother bore him. If Achilles\\nbe not thus assured by the voice of a god, he may come to fear presently\\nwhen one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are terrible if they\\nare seen face to face.\" \\n\\nNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, \"Juno, restrain\\nyour fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing the other\\ngods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side;\\nlet us take our places on some hill out of the beaten track, and let\\nmortals fight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin\\nfighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too,\\nwill at once raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will soon\\nleave the field and go back vanquished to Olympus among the other\\ngods.\" \\n\\nWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high earth-barrow\\nof Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the Trojans and\\nPallas Minerva for him fly to when the sea-monster was chasing him\\nfrom the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those that were with\\nhim took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of darkness; but the\\nother gods seated themselves on the brow of Callicolone round you,\\nO Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities. \\n\\nThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side\\nwas willing to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat\\non high was in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was\\nalive with men and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The\\nearth rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards\\neach other, and two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met\\nbetween the hosts to fight- to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble\\nAchilles. \\n\\nAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet tossing\\ndefiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his breast,\\nand brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the other\\nside sprang forth to meet him, fike some fierce lion that the whole\\ncountry-side has met to hunt and kill- at first he bodes no ill, but\\nwhen some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches openmouthed,\\nhis jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail from side to\\nside about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs straight before\\nhim, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slain among the foremost\\nof his foes- even with such fury did Achilles burn to spring upon\\nAeneas. \\n\\nWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to\\nspeak. \"Aeneas,\" said he, \"why do you stand thus out before the host\\nto fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the\\nseat of Priam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom\\nover to you. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his\\nown. Or have the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness,\\nfair with orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This\\nyou shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you\\nforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds helter-skelter\\ndown the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look behind you;\\nyou took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and with the\\nhelp of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and carried its women\\ninto captivity, though Jove and the other gods rescued you. You think\\nthey will protect you now, but they will not do so; therefore I say\\ngo back into the host, and do not face me, or you will rue it. Even\\na fool may be wise after the event.\" \\n\\nThen Aeneas answered, \"Son of Peleus, think not that your words can\\nscare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag and\\ntalk unseemly. We know one another\\'s race and parentage as matters\\nof common fame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I\\nyours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus, and that your mother\\nis Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises\\nfor my father, and Venus for my mother; the parents of one or other\\nof us shall this day mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk\\nthat shall part us when the fight is over. Learn, then, my lineage\\nif you will- and it is known to many. \\n\\n\"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded Dardania,\\nfor Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to dwell in,\\nand her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanus\\nhad a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living;\\nhe had three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and\\ntheir foals with them. Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding,\\nand covered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve\\nfilly foals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped\\nover the rich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn\\nand not break them; or again when they would disport themselves on\\nthe broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker.\\nErichthonius begat Tros, king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble\\nsons, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men;\\nwherefore the gods carried him off to be Jove\\'s cupbearer, for his\\nbeauty\\'s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals. Ilus begat\\nLaomedon, and Laomedon begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and\\nHiketaon of the stock of Mars. But Assaracus was father to Capys,\\nand Capys to Anchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to Priam.\\n\\n\"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove gives\\nit or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let there\\nbe no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children.\\nWe could fling taunts without end at one another; a hundred-oared\\ngalley would not hold them. The tongue can run all whithers and talk\\nall wise; it can go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he\\nbe gainsaid. What is the use of our bandying hard like women who when\\nthey fall foul of one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one\\nhalf true and the other lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours\\nshall turn me now that I am fain to fight- therefore let us make trial\\nof one another with our spears.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of\\nAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus\\nheld the shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid,\\nfor he deemed that Aeneas\\'s spear would go through it quite easily,\\nnot reflecting that the god\\'s glorious gifts were little likely to\\nyield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas\\'s spear did\\nnot pierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed\\nthe point. It went through two layers, but the god had made the shield\\nin five, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and one of\\ngold; it was in this that the spear was stayed. \\n\\nAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas\\nat the very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian\\nash went clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas\\nwas afraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him;\\nthe spear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the\\nground, after having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield.\\nAeneas though he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded with\\nfear and grief because the weapon had gone so near him; then Achilles\\nsprang furiously upon him, with a cry as of death and with his keen\\nblade drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men,\\nas men now are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it\\nquite easily. \\n\\nAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards\\nhim, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and\\nAchilles would have closed with him and despatched him with his sword,\\nhad not Neptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said\\nforthwith to the immortals, \"Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who\\nwill now go down to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of Peleus.\\nFool that he was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will\\nnever save him from destruction. Why should this man suffer when he\\nis guiltless, to no purpose, and in another\\'s quarrel? Has he not\\nat all times offered acceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in\\nheaven? Let us then snatch him from death\\'s jaws, lest the son of\\nSaturn be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that\\nhe should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved above\\nall the sons born to him of mortal women, shall not perish utterly\\nwithout seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated the blood of Priam,\\nwhile Aeneas shall reign over the Trojans, he and his children\\'s children\\nthat shall be born hereafter.\" \\n\\nThen answered Juno, \"Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and\\nconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him,\\nbrave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus.\\nFor of a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full many\\na time before all the immortals, that never would we shield Trojans\\nfrom destruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the flames\\nthat the Achaeans shall kindle.\" \\n\\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle amid\\nthe clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and Aeneas\\nwere. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of Peleus,\\ndrew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas, and\\nlaid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on high from\\noff the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band\\nof warriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god\\'s hand sped\\nhim, till he came to the very fringe of the battle where the Cauconians\\nwere arming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then\\ncame near to him and said, Aeneas, what god has egged you on to this\\nfolly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a mightier man of\\nvalour and more beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before him\\nwhensoever you meet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades even\\nthough fate would have it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may\\nthen fight among the foremost undaunted, for none other of the Achaeans\\nshall slay you.\" \\n\\nThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at\\nonce removed the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened\\nthem wide indeed and said in great anger, \"Alas! what marvel am I\\nnow beholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him\\nwhom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must\\nbe under heaven\\'s protection, although I had thought his boasting\\nwas idle. Let him go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me further,\\nseeing how narrowly he has missed being killed. I will now give my\\norders to the Danaans and attack some other of the Trojans.\"\\n\\nHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did\\nso. \"Let not the Trojans,\" he cried, \"keep you at arm\\'s length, Achaeans,\\nbut go for them and fight them man for man. However valiant I may\\nbe, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. Even Mars,\\nwho is an immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from flinging himself\\ninto the jaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless,\\nso far as in me lies I will show no slackness of hand or foot nor\\nwant of endurance, not even for a moment; I will utterly break their\\nranks, and woe to the Trojan who shall venture within reach of my\\nspear.\" \\n\\nThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans\\nand declared that he would fight Achilles. \"Be not afraid, proud Trojans,\"\\nsaid he, \"to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if\\nthe battle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match\\nfor me, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of Achilles\\nwill fall somewhat short of his word; he will do in part, and the\\nother part he will clip short. I will go up against him though his\\nhands be as fire- though his hands be fire and his strength iron.\"\\n\\nThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans,\\nand raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into the midst\\nof their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and said, \"Hector,\\non no account must you challenge Achilles to single combat; keep a\\nlookout for him while you are under cover of the others and away from\\nthe thick of the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear\\nor cut you down at close quarters.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was afraid\\nwhen he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then sprang upon\\nthe Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment.\\nFirst he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much people\\nwhom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities, in the\\nland of Hyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck\\nhim full on the head as he was coming on towards him, and split it\\nclean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted\\nover him saying, \"You he low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your\\ndeath is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your\\nfather\\'s estate lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters\\nof Hermus.\" \\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The\\nchariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him\\nin the front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon,\\na valiant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple\\nthrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear,\\nbut it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was\\nshed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended. Then he\\nstruck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from his\\nchariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed his last,\\nbellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to offer\\nhim in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the earth-shaker\\nis glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles then went\\nin pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his father had always forbidden\\nto fight because he was the youngest of his sons, the one he loved\\nbest, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and showing off the\\nfleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranks until he\\nlost his life, for Achilles struck him in the middle of the back as\\nhe was darting past him: he struck him just at the golden fastenings\\nof his belt and where the two pieces of the double breastplate overlapped.\\nThe point of the spear pierced him through and came out by the navel,\\nwhereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of darkness overshadowed\\nhim as he sank holding his entrails in his hands. \\n\\nWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands\\nand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he\\ncould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his\\nspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles\\nsaw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, \"This is he that has\\nwounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not\\nfor long shall we two quail before one another on the highways of\\nwar.\" \\n\\nHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, \"Draw near, that you may meet\\nyour doom the sooner.\" Hector feared him not and answered, \"Son of\\nPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a\\nchild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you\\nare a mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue\\nlies in the the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may\\nnot slay you with my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now.\"\\n\\nHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and\\nthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going\\ntowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet\\nin front of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud\\ncry, bent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god\\ncan, and hid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards\\nhim spear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air.\\nWhen he rushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god,\\nhe shouted aloud saying, \"Hound, this time too you have escaped death-\\nbut of a truth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom\\nit seems you pray before you go into battle, has again saved you;\\nbut if I too have any friend among the gods I will surely make an\\nend of you when I come across you at some other time. Now, however,\\nI will pursue and overtake other Trojans.\" \\n\\nOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck,\\nand he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and stayed\\nDemouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature,\\nby hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his\\nsword and killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and Dardanus,\\nsons of Bias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow\\nfrom a thrown spear, while the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight.\\nThere was also Tros the son of Alastor- he came up to Achilles and\\nclasped his knees in the hope that he would spare him and not kill\\nhim but let him go, because they were both of the same age. Fool,\\nhe might have known that he should not prevail with him, for the man\\nwas in no mood for pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore\\nwhen Tros laid hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers,\\nAchilles drove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling\\nout, while his bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled\\nfrom the wound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.\\n\\nAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a spear,\\nand the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He also\\nstruck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which became\\nwarm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of\\nEcheclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded Deucalion\\nin the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon\\nhe waited Achilles\\' onset with his arm hanging down and death staring\\nhim in the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword\\nand flung it helmet and all away from him, and the marrow came oozing\\nout of his backbone as he lay. He then went in pursuit of Rhigmus,\\nnoble son of Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and struck\\nhim through the middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly,\\nso that he fell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areithous\\nsquire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in flight,\\nand thrust him from his chariot, while the horses were struck with\\npanic. \\n\\nAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought- and the\\ndense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of\\nfire in every direction- even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding\\nhis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom\\nhe would slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes\\nbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor-\\nand it is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle-\\neven so did the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies\\nof the slain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the\\ncar were bespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses\\'\\nhoofs, and from the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed\\non to win still further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with\\ngore. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XXI\\n\\nNow when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,\\nbegotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: one half\\nhe chased over the plain towards the city by the same way that the\\nAchaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding day\\nwith Hector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and\\nJuno sent down a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other\\nhalf were hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into\\nit with a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again,\\nas they swam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirling\\neddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire-\\nthe flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they\\nhuddle into the water- even so was the eddying stream of Xanthus filled\\nwith the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in confusion before\\nAchilles. \\n\\nForthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it against\\na tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god, armed with\\nhis sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the Trojans down\\non every side. Their dying groans rose hideous as the sword smote\\nthem, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish fly scared before\\na huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven-\\nfor he is sure to eat all he can catch- even so did the Trojans cower\\nunder the banks of the mighty river, and when Achilles\\' arms grew\\nweary with killing them, he drew twelve youths alive out of the water,\\nto sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of Menoetius. He drew them\\nout like dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the girdles\\nof their own shirts, and gave them over to his men to take back to\\nthe ships. Then he sprang into the river, thirsting for still further\\nblood. \\n\\nThere he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was escaping\\nout of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner when he\\nwas in his father\\'s vineyard, having set upon him by night, as he\\nwas cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker sides\\nof a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares, and\\nsent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him. But\\na guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum, and\\nsent him to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his father\\'s\\nhouse. He had spent eleven days happily with his friends after he\\nhad come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again delivered him\\ninto the hands of Achilles, who was to send him to the house of Hades\\nsorely against his will. He was unarmed when Achilles caught sight\\nof him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear,\\nfor he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank, and was\\nsweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that his strength\\nwas now failing him. \\n\\nThen Achilles said to himself in his surprise, \"What marvel do I see\\nhere? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over\\ninto Lemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising\\nfrom the world below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison\\nhim, as they do many another whether he will or no? This time let\\nhim taste my spear, that I may know for certain whether mother earth\\nwho can keep even a strong man down, will be able to hold him, or\\nwhether thence too he will return.\" \\n\\nThus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and\\ntrying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.\\nAchilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaon\\nran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed\\nover his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was for\\nblood. With one hand he caught Achilles\\' knees as he besought him,\\nand with the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go.\\nThen he said, \"Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am\\nyour suppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the\\nday when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold\\naway to Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you\\nthe price of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times as much to gain\\nmy freedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after\\nmuch suffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.\\nSurely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you\\na second time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me,\\ndaughter of aged Altes- of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegae\\nand holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married his\\ndaughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,\\nboth of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus\\nas he was fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall\\nme, for I fear that I shall not escape you since heaven has delivered\\nme over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart,\\nspare me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew your brave\\nand noble comrade.\" \\n\\nWith such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles; but\\nAchilles answered him sternly. \"Idiot,\" said he, \"talk not to me of\\nransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojans quarter,\\nand sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive; but\\nnow not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands\\nbefore the city of Ilius- and of all Trojans it shall fare hardest\\nwith the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall die. Why\\nshould you whine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was a better\\nman than you are. I too- see you not how I am great and goodly? I\\nam son to a noble father, and have a goddess for my mother, but the\\nhands of doom and death overshadow me all as surely. The day will\\ncome, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when one shall take\\nmy life also in battle, either with his spear, or with an arrow sped\\nfrom his bow.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and Lycaon\\'s heart sank within him. He loosed his\\nhold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achilles\\ndrew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck;\\nhe plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon\\nhe lay at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from\\nhim till the earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot\\nand flung him into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him\\nthe while, and saying, \"Lie there among the fishes, who will lick\\nthe blood from your wound and gloat over it; your mother shall not\\nlay you on any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall\\nbear you into the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed\\non the fat of Lycaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the waters-\\nso perish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilius- you\\nin flight, and I following after to destroy you. The river with its\\nbroad silver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls\\nyou offered him and all the horses that you flung living into his\\nwaters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not\\na man of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and the\\nhavoc you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while I held\\naloof from battle.\" \\n\\nSo spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and pondered\\nwithin himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles and save the\\nTrojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear in hand,\\nsprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He was son to\\nthe broad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter of Acessamenus;\\nfor the river had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up out of the water\\nto face him with a spear in either hand, and Xanthus filled him with\\ncourage, being angry for the death of the youths whom Achilles was\\nslaying ruthlessly within his waters. When they were close up with\\none another Achilles was first to speak. \"Who and whence are you,\"\\nsaid he, \"who dare to face me? Woe to the parents whose son stands\\nup against me.\" And the son of Pelegon answered, \"Great son of Peleus,\\nwhy should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile land of far Paeonia,\\ncaptain of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven days that I am at Ilius.\\nI am of the blood of the river Axius- of Axius that is the fairest\\nof all rivers that run. He begot the famed warrior Pelegon, whose\\nson men call me. Let us now fight, Achilles.\" \\n\\nThus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash.\\nAsteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both hands\\nalike; with the one spear he struck Achilles\\' shield, but did not\\npierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;\\nwith the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right arm drawing\\ndark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the\\nground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill\\nhim, hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck\\nthe steep bank of the river, driving the spear half its length into\\nthe earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword and sprang furiously\\nupon him. Asteropaeus vainly tried to draw Achilles\\' spear out of\\nthe bank by main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his\\nmight to draw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the fourth\\ntime he tried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so Achilles\\nsmote him with his sword and killed him. He struck him in the belly\\nnear the navel, so that all his bowels came gushing out on to the\\nground, and the darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping.\\nThen Achilles set his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armour,\\nvaunting over him and saying, \"Lie there- begotten of a river though\\nyou be, it is hard for you to strive with the offspring of Saturn\\'s\\nson. You declare yourself sprung from the blood of a broad river,\\nbut I am of the seed of mighty Jove. My father is Peleus, son of Aeacus\\nruler over the many Myrmidons, and Aeacus was the son of Jove. Therefore\\nas Jove is mightier than any river that flows into the sea, so are\\nhis children stronger than those of any river whatsoever. Moreover\\nyou have a great river hard by if he can be of any use to you, but\\nthere is no fighting against Jove the son of Saturn, with whom not\\neven King Achelous can compare, nor the mighty stream of deep-flowing\\nOceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with all springs and deep wells\\nproceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings of great Jove, and his\\nthunder that comes crashing out of heaven.\" \\n\\nWith this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that he\\nhad killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand, with\\nthe dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy nibbling\\nand gnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he went in chase\\nof the Paeonians, who were flying along the bank of the river in panic\\nwhen they saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of Peleus.\\nTherein he slew Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus, Mnesus, Thrasius,\\nOeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not\\nthe river in anger taken human form, and spoken to him from out the\\ndeep waters saying, \"Achilles, if you excel all in strength, so do\\nyou also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to protect\\nyou: if, then, the son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to you to destroy\\nall the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream, and do your\\ngrim work on land. My fair waters are now filled with corpses, nor\\ncan I find any channel by which I may pour myself into the sea for\\nI am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilessly slaying. I am\\nin despair, therefore, O captain of your host, trouble me no further.\"\\n\\nAchilles answered, \"So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I will\\nnever cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pent\\nthem up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that\\nI may learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the gods.\\nBut the river said to Apollo, \"Surely, son of Jove, lord of the silver\\nbow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who charged you straitly\\nthat you should stand by the Trojans and defend them, till twilight\\nfades, and darkness is over an the earth.\" \\n\\nMeanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon the\\nriver raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his stream into\\na torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain and\\nleft within his waters. These he cast out on to the land, bellowing\\nlike a bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding them\\nin his mighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gathered about Achilles,\\nfalling upon him and beating on his shield, so that he could not keep\\nhis feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but it came up by the\\nroots, and tore away the bank, damming the stream with its thick branches\\nand bridging it all across; whereby Achilles struggled out of the\\nstream, and fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid.\\n\\nBut the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him\\nwith a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojans from\\ndestruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear\\'s throw from him;\\nswift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest\\nand fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and the\\narmour rang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but the\\nriver with a loud roar came tearing after. As one who would water\\nhis garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, and\\nall his ground-spade in hand he clears away the dams to free the channels,\\nand the little stones run rolling round and round with the water as\\nit goes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow- even\\nso did the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a fleet\\nrunner, for the gods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive\\nto stand his ground, and see whether or no all the gods in heaven\\nwere in league against him, so often would the mighty wave come beating\\ndown upon his shoulders, and be would have to keep flying on and on\\nin great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as it flowed\\npast him and ate the ground from under his feet. \\n\\nThen the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, \"Father\\nJove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save\\nme from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards.\\nI blame none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do\\nmy dear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was\\nto fall under the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would\\nthat Hector, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me;\\nthen should I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems\\nthat I shall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river as\\nthough I were some swineherd\\'s boy, who gets carried down a torrent\\nwhile trying to cross it during a storm.\" \\n\\nAs soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him\\nin the likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.\\nNeptune spoke first. \"Son of Peleus,\" said he, \"be not so exceeding\\nfearful; we are two gods, come with Jove\\'s sanction to assist you,\\nI, and Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river;\\nhe will abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise\\nyou, if you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting\\ntill you have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius-\\nas many of them as may escape. Then kill Hector and go back to the\\nships, for we will vouchsafe you a triumph over him.\" \\n\\nWhen they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but Achilles\\nstrove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge the gods had\\nlaid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of waters, and much\\ngoodly armour of the youths that had been slain was rifting about,\\nas also many corpses, but he forced his way against the stream, speeding\\nright onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, for Minerva had\\nendowed him with great strength. Nevertheless Scamander did not slacken\\nin his pursuit, but was still more furious with the son of Peleus.\\nHe lifted his waters into a high crest and cried aloud to Simois saying,\\n\"Dear brother, let the two of us unite to save this man, or he will\\nsack the mighty city of King Priam, and the Trojans will not hold\\nout against him. Help me at once; fill your streams with water from\\ntheir sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your wave\\non high, and let snags and stones come thundering down you that we\\nmay make an end of this savage creature who is now lording it as though\\nhe were a god. Nothing shall serve him longer, not strength nor comeliness,\\nnor his fine armour, which forsooth shall soon be lying low in the\\ndeep waters covered over with mud. I will wrap him in sand, and pour\\ntons of shingle round him, so that the Achaeans shall not know how\\nto gather his bones for the silt in which I shall have hidden him,\\nand when they celebrate his funeral they need build no barrow.\"\\n\\nOn this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles, seething\\nas it was with foam and blood and the bo&ies of the dead. The dark\\nwaters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed the son\\nof Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be swept away\\nin the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to\\nVulcan her son. \"Crook-foot,\" she cried, \"my child, be up and doing,\\nfor I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us at\\nonce, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and the\\nwhite south wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear\\nthe flames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consume\\nthem, while you go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees and\\nwrapping him round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither by\\nfair words nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then\\nyou may stay your flames.\" \\n\\nOn this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon the\\nplain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whose\\nbodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain\\nwas dried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on an orchard\\nthat has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and the heart\\nof the owner is glad- even so the whole plan was dried and the dead\\nbodies were consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on to the river.\\nHe burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus also,\\nwith the rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by the banks\\nof the river. The eels and fishes that go darting about everywhere\\nin the water, these, too, were sorely harassed by the flames that\\ncunning Vulcan had kindled, and the river himself was scalded, so\\nthat he spoke saying, \"Vulcan, there is no god can hold his own against\\nyou. I cannot fight you when you flare out your flames in this way;\\nstrive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive the Trojans out of city\\nimmediately. What have I to do with quarrelling and helping people?\"\\n\\nHe was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As a\\ncauldron upon \\'a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of some\\nfatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the dry faggots\\nblaze under it- even so were the goodly waters of Xanthus heated with\\nthe fire till they were boiling. He could flow no longer but stayed\\nhis stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts of fire which cunning\\nVulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno and besought her saying,\\n\"Juno, why should your son vex my stream with such especial fury?\\nI am not so much to blame as all the others are who have been helping\\nthe Trojans. I will leave off, since you so desire it, and let son\\nleave off also. Furthermore I swear never again will I do anything\\nto save the Trojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is burning\\nin the flames which the Achaeans will kindle.\" \\n\\nAs soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, \"Son Vulcan,\\nhold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence against a\\ngod for the sake of mortals.\" \\n\\nWhen she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the river\\nwent back once more into his own fair bed. \\n\\nXanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno stayed\\nthem though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke out among\\nthe other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fell on one\\nanother with a mighty uproar- earth groaned, and the spacious firmament\\nrang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he was sitting\\non Olympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows\\namong themselves. They were not long about beginning, and Mars piercer\\nof shields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at once upon\\nMinerva and reviled her. \"Why, vixen,\" said he, \"have you again set\\nthe gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of your heart? Have\\nyou forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound me, and\\nyourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurt of my\\nfair body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to me.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis- so terrible\\nthat not even can Jove\\'s lightning pierce it. Here did murderous Mars\\nstrike her with his great spear. She drew back and with her strong\\nhand seized a stone that was lying on the plain- great and rugged\\nand black- which men of old had set for the boundary of a field. With\\nthis she struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down. Nine roods\\ndid he cover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled in the dust,\\nwhile his armour rang rattling round him. But Minerva laughed and\\nvaunted over him saying, \"Idiot, have you not learned how far stronger\\nI am than you, but you must still match yourself against me? Thus\\ndo your mother\\'s curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would\\ndo you mischief because you have deserted the Achaeans and are helping\\nthe Trojans.\" \\n\\nShe then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove\\'s daughter\\nVenus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all the time,\\nfor it was only with great difficulty that he had come to himself\\nagain. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, \"Look, daughter\\nof aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is again taking\\nMars through the crowd out of the battle; go after her at once.\"\\n\\nThus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made at\\nher, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fell\\nfainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full\\nlength. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, \"May all who help the\\nTrojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart\\nas Venus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Had\\nthis been so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking the\\nstrong city of Ilius.\" \\n\\nJuno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo\\nsaying, \"Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm\\'s length? it\\nis not well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be disgraceful\\nto us if we return to Jove\\'s bronze-floored mansion on Olympus without\\nhaving fought each other; therefore come on, you are the younger of\\nthe two, and I ought not to attack you, for I am older and have had\\nmore experience. Idiot, you have no sense, and forget how we two alone\\nof all the gods fared hardly round about Ilius when we came from Jove\\'s\\nhouse and worked for Laomedon a whole year at a stated wage and he\\ngave us his orders. I built the Trojans the wall about their city,\\nso wide and fair that it might be impregnable, while you, Phoebus,\\nherded cattle for him in the dales of many valleyed Ida. When, however,\\nthe glad hours brought round the time of payment, mighty Laomedon\\nrobbed us of all our hire and sent us off with nothing but abuse.\\nHe threatened to bind us hand and foot and sell us over into some\\ndistant island. He tried, moreover, to cut off the ears of both of\\nus, so we went away in a rage, furious about the payment he had promised\\nus, and yet withheld; in spite of all this, you are now showing favour\\nto his people, and will not join us in compassing the utter ruin of\\nthe proud Trojans with their wives and children.\" \\n\\nAnd King Apollo answered, \"Lord of the earthquake, you would have\\nno respect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserable\\nmortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the\\nfield, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay this\\nfighting at once and let them settle it among themselves.\"\\n\\nHe turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the brother\\nof his own father. But his sister the huntress Diana, patroness of\\nwild beasts, was very angry with him and said, \"So you would fly,\\nFar-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheap vaunt to\\nboot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear you\\nbragging in my father\\'s house, as you have often done in the presence\\nof the immortals, that you would stand up and fight with Neptune.\"\\n\\nApollo made her no answer, but Jove\\'s august queen was angry and upbraided\\nher bitterly. \"Bold vixen,\" she cried, \"how dare you cross me thus?\\nFor all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own against me.\\nJove made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill them whenever\\nyou choose. You will And it better to chase wild beasts and deer upon\\nthe mountains than to fight those who are stronger than you are. If\\nyou would try war, do so, and find out by pitting yourself against\\nme, how far stronger I am than you are.\" \\n\\nShe caught both Diana\\'s wrists with her left hand as she spoke, and\\nwith her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as\\nshe beat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhed\\nunder her blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she\\nfled weeping from under Juno\\'s hand as a dove that flies before a\\nfalcon to the cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune\\nto escape. Even so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows\\nbehind her. \\n\\nThen the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, \"Leto,\\nI shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove\\'s\\nwives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you worsted\\nme in fair fight.\" \\n\\nLeto then gathered up Diana\\'s bow and arrows that had fallen about\\namid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all haste\\nafter her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove\\'s bronze-floored mansion\\non Olympus, and sat herself down with many tears on the knees of her\\nfather, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all about her. The\\nson of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughing pleasantly the while\\nbegan to question her saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings, my dear\\nchild, has been treating you in this cruel manner, as though you had\\nbeen misconducting yourself in the face of everybody?\" and the fair-crowned\\ngoddess of the chase answered, \"It was your wife Juno, father, who\\nhas been beating me; it is always her doing when there is any quarrelling\\namong the immortals.\" \\n\\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the strong\\ncity of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not hold out\\nand the Danaans should take the city then and there, before its hour\\nhad come; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back, some angry\\nand some triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats beside\\nJove lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on dealing\\nout death alike on the Trojans and on their As when the smoke from\\nsome burning city ascends to heaven when the anger of the gods has\\nkindled it- there is then toil for all, and sorrow for not a few-\\neven so did Achilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.\\n\\nOld King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on huge\\nAchilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there\\nwas none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower and\\nwith many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave\\nwarders of the gate. \"Keep the gates,\" said he, \"wide open till the\\npeople come flying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving\\nthem in rout before him. I see we are in great peril. As soon as our\\npeople are inside and in safety, close the strong gates for I fear\\nlest that terrible man should come bounding inside along with the\\nothers.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and when\\nthese were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans. Apollo\\nthen came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect them.\\nRight for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and grimy\\nwith dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding his spear furiously\\nbehind them. For he was as one possessed, and was thirsting after\\nglory. \\n\\nThen had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy if\\nApollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor.\\nHe put courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him,\\nleaning against a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. When\\nAgenor saw Achilles he stood still and his heart was clouded with\\ncare. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in his dismay, \"if I fly before mighty\\nAchilles, and go where all the others are being driven in rout, he\\nwill none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How would it\\nbe were I to let Achilles drive the others before him, and then fly\\nfrom the wall to the plain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spurs\\nof Ida and can hide in the underwood that is thereon? I could then\\nwash the sweat from off me in the river and in the evening return\\nto Ilius. But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he\\nwould see me as I am hurrying from the city over the plain, and would\\nspeed after me till he had caught me- I should stand no chance against\\nhim, for he is mightiest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out and\\nmeet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be pierced\\nby pointed bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and men say that\\nhe is but mortal despite the triumph that Jove son of Saturn vouchsafes\\nhim.\" \\n\\nSo saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was now\\nfain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert\\nto attack a hunter- she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the baying\\nof the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and wound\\nher either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has pierced\\nher she will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip\\nor been killed outright- even so did noble Agenor son of Antenor refuse\\nto fly till he had made trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with\\nhis spear, holding his round shield before him and crying with a loud\\nvoice. \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"noble Achilles, you deem that you shall\\nthis day sack the city of the proud Trojans. Fool, there will be trouble\\nenough yet before it, for there is many a brave man of us still inside\\nwho will stand in front of our dear parents with our wives and children,\\nto defend Ilius. Here therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you\\nbe, here shall you cue. \\n\\nAs he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the spear\\nstruck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newly wrought\\ntin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him whom\\nit had struck, and did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayed it.\\nAchilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not vouchsafe\\nhim glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a thick mist,\\nsending him out of the battle unmolested Then he craftily drew the\\nson of Peleus away from going after the host, for he put on the semblance\\nof Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who ran towards him to give\\nhim chase and pursued him over the corn lands of the plain, turning\\nhim towards the deep waters of the river Scamander. Apollo ran but\\na little way before him and beguiled Achilles by making him think\\nall the time that he was on the point of overtaking him. Meanwhile\\nthe rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd within the city\\ntill their numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare wait for one\\nanother outside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were\\nfallen in fight, but all whose feet and knees could still carry them\\npoured pell-mell into the town. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XXII\\n\\nThus the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat\\nfrom off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the\\ngoodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon\\ntheir shoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector\\nstay where he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus\\nApollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, \"Why, son of Peleus, do\\nyou, who are but man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not\\nyet found out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did\\nnot harass the Trojans whom you had routed, and now they are within\\ntheir walls, while you have been decoyed hither away from them. Me\\nyou cannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me.\" \\n\\nAchilles was greatly angered and said, \"You have baulked me, Far-Darter,\\nmost malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from the wall,\\nwhere many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got within\\nIlius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved the Trojans\\nat no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I would\\nindeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.\"\\n\\nOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winning\\nhorse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is flying over\\nthe plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of Achilles bear\\nhim onwards. King Priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain,\\nall radiant as the star which men call Orion\\'s Hound, and whose beams\\nblaze forth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any\\nother that shines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he\\nyet bodes ill for mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train-\\neven so did Achilles\\' armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards.\\nPriam raised a cry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them\\nup and shouted out to his dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector\\nstill stayed before the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle\\nwith Achilles. The old man reached out his arms towards him and bade\\nhim for pity\\'s sake come within the walls. \"Hector,\" he cried, \"my\\nson, stay not to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will\\nmeet death at the hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than\\nyou. Monster that he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better\\nthan I do, for so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay\\nstretched on earth, and a load of grief would be lifted from my heart,\\nfor many a brave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or\\nselling them away in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now\\nI miss two sons from among the Trojans who have thronged within the\\ncity, Lycaon and Polydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore\\nme. Should they be still alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we\\nwill ransom them with gold and bronze, of which we have store, for\\nthe old man Altes endowed his daughter richly; but if they are already\\ndead and in the house of Hades, sorrow will it be to us two who were\\ntheir parents; albeit the grief of others will be more short-lived\\nunless you too perish at the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son,\\nwithin the city, to be the guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women,\\nor you will both lose your own life and afford a mighty triumph to\\nthe son of Peleus. Have pity also on your unhappy father while life\\nyet remains to him- on me, whom the son of Saturn will destroy by\\na terrible doom on the threshold of old age, after I have seen my\\nsons slain and my daughters haled away as captives, my bridal chambers\\npillaged, little children dashed to earth amid the rage of battle,\\nand my sons\\' wives dragged away by the cruel hands of the Achaeans;\\nin the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces at my own gates after\\nsome one has beaten the life out of my body with sword or spear-hounds\\nthat I myself reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates, but\\nwho will yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors.\\nWhen a young man falls by the sword in battle, he may lie where he\\nis and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be seen, all is honourable\\nin death, but when an old man is slain there is nothing in this world\\nmore pitiable than that dogs should defile his grey hair and beard\\nand all that men hide for shame.\" \\n\\nThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heart\\nof Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared her\\nbosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. \"Hector,\" she\\ncried, weeping bitterly the while, \"Hector, my son, spurn not this\\nbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort\\nfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the\\nwall to protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should\\nthe wretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall\\never weep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie,\\nfor dogs will devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.\" \\n\\nThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved\\nnot the heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles\\nas he drew nearer towards him. As serpent in its den upon the mountains,\\nfull fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man- he is\\nfilled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes writhing round\\nhis den- even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted\\nout from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted. \\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, \"if I go\\nwithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon\\nme, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city\\non that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would\\nnot listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so.\\nNow that my folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men\\nand Trojan women in the face, lest a worse man should say, \\'Hector\\nhas ruined us by his self-confidence.\\' Surely it would be better for\\nme to return after having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die\\ngloriously here before the city. What, again, if were to lay down\\nmy shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight\\nup to noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen,\\nwho was the fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that\\nAlexandrus brought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let\\nthe Achaeans divide the half of everything that the city contains\\namong themselves? I might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their\\nprinces, take a solemn oath that they would hide nothing, but would\\ndivide into two shares all that is within the city- but why argue\\nwith myself in this way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no\\nkind of mercy; he would kill me then and there as easily as though\\nI were a woman, when I had off my armour. There is no parleying with\\nhim from some rock or oak tree as young men and maidens prattle with\\none another. Better fight him at once, and learn to which of us Jove\\nwill vouchsafe victory.\" \\n\\nThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were\\nMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he brandished\\nhis terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed around him\\nlike flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell upon Hector\\nas he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he was but fled\\nin dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted after him at\\nhis utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds, swoops\\ndown upon some cowering dove- the dove flies before him but the falcon\\nwith a shrill scream follows close after, resolved to have her- even\\nso did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might, while\\nHector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take\\nhim. \\n\\nOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall,\\npast the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree,\\ntill they came to two fair springs which feed the river Scamander.\\nOne of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke\\nfrom a burning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as hail\\nor snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs,\\nare the goodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace\\nbefore the coming of the Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of\\nthe Trojans used to wash their clothes. Past these did they fly, the\\none in front and the other giving ha. behind him: good was the man\\nthat fled, but better far was he that followed after, and swiftly\\nindeed did they run, for the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice\\nor bullock\\'s hide, as it might be for a common foot-race, but they\\nran for the life of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speed round\\nthe turning-posts when they are running for some great prize- a tripod\\nor woman- at the games in honour of some dead hero, so did these two\\nrun full speed three times round the city of Priam. All the gods watched\\nthem, and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" said he, \"my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursued\\nround the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hector, who\\nhas burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, at one while\\non the of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and\\nnow I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of\\nPriam. What say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether\\nwe shall now save him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before\\nAchilles, son of Peleus.\" \\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud\\nand storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom has\\nlong been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we\\nothers shall not be of a mind with you.\" \\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not speak\\nin full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without let\\nor hindrance as you are minded.\" \\n\\nThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she darted\\nfrom the topmost summits of Olympus. \\n\\nAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a\\nfawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts\\nthrough glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by crouching\\nunder cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up\\nuntil he gets her- even so there was no escape for Hector from the\\nfleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian\\ngates and under the walls, that his people might help him by showering\\ndown weapons from above, Achilles would gain on him and head him back\\ntowards the plain, keeping himself always on the city side. As a man\\nin a dream who fails to lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing-\\nthe one cannot escape nor the other overtake- even so neither could\\nAchilles come up with Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles;\\nnevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time\\ncome when Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved\\nhis running, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs\\nto the Achaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to\\naim a dart at Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit\\nhim and he might himself come in second. Then, at last, as they were\\nnearing the fountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced\\nhis golden scales and placed a doom in each of them, one for Achilles\\nand the other for Hector. As he held the scales by the middle, the\\ndoom of Hector fell down deep into the house of Hades- and then Phoebus\\nApollo left him. Thereon Minerva went close up to the son of Peleus\\nand said, \"Noble Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely\\ntake back to the ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector,\\nfor all his lust of battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling\\nbefore his father, aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer.\\nStay here and take breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to\\nmake a stand and fight you.\" \\n\\nThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still, leaning\\non his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him and went\\nafter Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She came\\nclose up to him and said, \"Dear brother, I see you are hard pressed\\nby Achilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of Priam,\\nlet us await his onset and stand on our defence.\" \\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to me\\nof all my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth I\\nshall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside\\nthe wall for my sake when all the others remain inside.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Dear brother, my father and mother went down on\\ntheir knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside,\\nso great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of\\ngrief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and\\nfight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we\\nmay learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to\\nthe ships, or whether he shall fall before you.\" \\n\\nThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were\\nnow close to one another great Hector was first to speak. \"I will-no\\nlonger fly you, son of Peleus,\" said he, \"as I have been doing hitherto.\\nThree times have I fled round the mighty city of Priam, without daring\\nto withstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for I am\\nin the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one another\\nby our gods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants;\\nlet it be agreed between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer\\nstay and I take your life, I am not to treat your dead body in any\\nunseemly fashion, but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am\\nto give up your body to the Achaeans. And do you likewise.\"\\n\\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Fool, prate not to me about\\ncovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves\\nand lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out\\nan through. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and\\nme, nor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall\\nfall and glut grim Mars with his life\\'s blood. Put forth all your\\nstrength; you have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier\\nand man of war. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith\\nvanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief\\nyou have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have killed\\nin battle.\" \\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it coming\\nand avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over\\nhis head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it\\nup and gave it back to Achilles without Hector\\'s seeing her; Hector\\nthereon said to the son of Peleus, \"You have missed your aim, Achilles,\\npeer of the gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of\\nmy doom, though you made sure that he had done so. You were a false-tongued\\nliar when you deemed that I should forget my valour and quail before\\nyou. You shall not drive spear into the back of a runaway- drive it,\\nshould heaven so grant you power, drive it into me as I make straight\\ntowards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can-\\nwould that you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you\\nwere once dead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for\\nit is you who have harmed them most.\" \\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true for\\nhe hit the middle of Achilles\\' shield, but the spear rebounded from\\nit, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon\\nhad sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had\\nno second spear. With a loud cry he called Diphobus and asked him\\nfor one, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself,\\n\"Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that\\nthe hero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the wall, and\\nMinerva has inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at\\nhand and there is no way out of it- for so Jove and his son Apollo\\nthe far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever\\nready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die\\ningloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great\\nthing that shall be told among men hereafter.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by\\nhis side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like\\na soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb\\nor timid hare- even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon\\nAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous\\nshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four\\nlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of gold\\nwi which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the\\nevening star that shines brighter than all others through the stillness\\nof night, even such was the gleam of the spear which Achilles poised\\nin his right hand, fraught with the death of noble Hector. He eyed\\nhis fair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it,\\nbut all was protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had spoiled\\nPatroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat where the collar-bones\\ndivide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a most deadly place:\\nhere then did Achilles strike him as he was coming on towards him,\\nand the point of his spear went right through the fleshy part of the\\nneck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could still speak.\\nHector fell headlong, and Achilles vaunted over him saying, \"Hector,\\nyou deemed that you should come off scatheless when you were spoiling\\nPatroclus, and recked not of myself who was not with him. Fool that\\nyou were: for I, his comrade, mightier far than he, was still left\\nbehind him at the ships, and now I have laid you low. The Achaeans\\nshall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and vultures shall\\nwork their will upon yourself.\" \\n\\nThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, \"I pray you by your\\nlife and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at the\\nships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronze\\nwhich my father and mother will offer you, and send my body home,\\nthat the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when\\nI am dead.\" \\n\\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Dog, talk not to me neither\\nof knees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able\\nto cut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill have done\\nme, as I am that nothing shall save you from the dogs- it shall not\\nbe, though they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for\\nme on the spot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son\\nof Dardanus should bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so\\nyour mother shall never lay you out and make lament over the son she\\nbore, but dogs and vultures shall eat you utterly up.\" \\n\\nHector with his dying breath then said, \"I know you what you are,\\nand was sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as\\niron; look to it that I bring not heaven\\'s anger upon you on the day\\nwhen Paris and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you\\nat the Scaean gates.\" \\n\\nWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his\\nsoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting\\nits sad fate that it should en\\' youth and strength no longer. But\\nAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, \"Die; for my part I will\\naccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send\\nit.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side;\\nthen he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector\\'s shoulders\\nwhile the other Achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength\\nand beauty; and no one came near him without giving him a fresh wound.\\nThen would one turn to his neighbour and say, \"It is easier to handle\\nHector now than when he was flinging fire on to our ships\" and as\\nhe spoke he would thrust his spear into him anew. \\n\\nWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among\\nthe Argives and said, \"My friends, princes and counsellors of the\\nArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who\\nhas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether\\nwe should not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind\\nthe Trojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert\\ntheir city now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out even\\nthough he is no longer living. But why argue with myself in this way,\\nwhile Patroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned-\\nhe Whom I can never forget so long as I am alive and my strength fails\\nnot? Though men forget their dead when once they are within the house\\nof Hades, yet not even there will I forget the comrade whom I have\\nlost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory\\nand go back to the ships taking this man along with us; for we have\\nachieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to whom the\\nTrojans prayed throughout their city as though he were a god.\"\\n\\nOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the\\nsinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed\\nthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the\\nbody fast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground.\\nThen when he had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself\\nmounted, he lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth.\\nThe dust rose from Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark\\nhair flew all abroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on\\nearth, for Jove had now delivered him into the hands of his foes to\\ndo him outrage in his own land. \\n\\nThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His mother\\ntore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as she\\nlooked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and throughout\\nthe city the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was as though\\nthe whole of frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire. Hardly could\\nthe people hold Priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates\\nof the city. He grovelled in the mire and besought them, calling each\\none of them by his name. \"Let be, my friends,\" he cried, \"and for\\nall your sorrow, suffer me to go single-handed to the ships of the\\nAchaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he\\nwill respect the feeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on\\nmy old age. His own father is even such another as myself- Peleus,\\nwho bred him and reared him to- be the bane of us Trojans, and of\\nmyself more than of all others. Many a son of mine has he slain in\\nthe flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as I may, I do\\nso for one- Hector- more than for them all, and the bitterness of\\nmy sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades. Would that he\\nhad died in my arms, for so both his ill-starred mother who bore him,\\nand myself, should have had the comfort of weeping and mourning over\\nhim.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city\\njoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among\\nthe Trojans. \"Alas, my son,\" she cried, \"what have I left to live\\nfor now that you are no more? Night and day did I glory in. you throughout\\nthe city, for you were a tower of strength to all in Troy, and both\\nmen and women alike hailed you as a god. So long as you lived you\\nwere their pride, but now death and destruction have fallen upon you.\"\\n\\nHector\\'s wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to tell\\nher that her husband had remained without the gates. She was at her\\nloom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and\\nembroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a large\\ntripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector when\\nhe came out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond\\nthe reach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by the hands\\nof Achilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and trembled\\nin every limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke\\nto her waiting-women. \"Two of you,\" she said, \"come with me that I\\nmay learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my husband\\'s\\nhonoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would come into my\\nmouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune for Priam\\'s\\nchildren must be at hand. May I never live to hear it, but I greatly\\nfear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hector and has\\nchased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he may\\nhave put an end to the reckless daring which possessed my husband,\\nwho would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on\\nfar in front, foremost of them all in valour.\" \\n\\nHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like\\na maniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached\\nthe battlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon\\nthe wall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city- the\\nhorses dragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the\\nships of the Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness\\nof night and she fell fainting backwards. She tore the tiring from\\nher head and flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited\\nband, and the veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when\\nHector took her with him from the house of Eetion, after having given\\ncountless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband\\'s sisters and\\nthe wives of his brothers crowded round her and supported her, for\\nshe was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presently breathed\\nand came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans\\nsaying, \\'Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common\\nlot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes\\nunder the wooded mountain of Placus in the house of Eetion who brought\\nme up when I was a child- ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter-\\nwould that he had never begotten me. You are now going into the house\\nof Hades under the secret places of the earth, and you leave me a\\nsorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom you and I are the\\nunhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that you are gone, O\\nHector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you. Even though he\\nescape the horrors of this woful war with the Achaeans, yet shall\\nhis life henceforth be one of labour and sorrow, for others will seize\\nhis lands. The day that robs a child of his parents severs him from\\nhis own kind; his head is bowed, his cheeks are wet with tears, and\\nhe will go about destitute among the friends of his father, plucking\\none by the cloak and another by the shirt. Some one or other of these\\nmay so far pity him as to hold the cup for a moment towards him and\\nlet him moisten his lips, but he must not drink enough to wet the\\nroof of his mouth; then one whose parents are alive will drive him\\nfrom the table with blows and angry words. \\'Out with you,\\' he will\\nsay, \\'you have no father here,\\' and the child will go crying back\\nto his widowed mother- he, Astyanax, who erewhile would sit upon his\\nfather\\'s knees, and have none but the daintiest and choicest morsels\\nset before him. When he had played till he was tired and went to sleep,\\nhe would lie in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, on a soft couch,\\nknowing neither want nor care, whereas now that he has lost his father\\nhis lot will be full of hardship- he, whom the Trojans name Astyanax,\\nbecause you, O Hector, were the only defence of their gates and battlements.\\nThe wriggling writhing worms will now eat you at the ships, far from\\nyour parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves upon you. You\\nwill lie naked, although in your house you have fine and goodly raiment\\nmade by hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of no use to you,\\nfor you can never again wear it, and thus you will have respect shown\\nyou by the Trojans both men and women.\" \\n\\nIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined\\nin her lament. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XXIII\\n\\nThus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the Achaeans\\nwhen they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his own ship.\\nBut Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave\\ncomrades saying, \"Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends,\\nnot yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw\\nnear to the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honour to the dead. When\\nwe have had full comfort of lamentation we will unyoke our horses\\nand take supper all of us here.\" \\n\\nOn this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them\\nin their lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing\\nround the body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning.\\nThe sands of the seashore and the men\\'s armour were wet with their\\nweeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. Chief\\nin all their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained\\nhand on the breast of his friend. \"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus,\\neven in the house of Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised\\nyou; I will drag Hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve\\nnoble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge\\nyou.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely, laying\\nit at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. The others\\nthen put off every man his armour, took the horses from their chariots,\\nand seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the fleet\\ndescendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an abundant funeral\\nbanquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did\\nthey butcher and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed,\\ndid they singe and set to roast in the flames of Vulcan; and rivulets\\nof blood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.\\n\\nThen the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to Agamemnon,\\nbut hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so wroth was\\nhe for the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon\\'s\\ntent they told the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire\\nin case they might persuade the son of Peleus \\'to wash the clotted\\ngore from this body, but he denied them sternly, and swore it with\\na solemn oath, saying, \"Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiest of\\nall gods, it is not meet that water should touch my body, till I have\\nlaid Patroclus on the flames, have built him a barrow, and shaved\\nmy head- for so long as I live no such second sorrow shall ever draw\\nnigh me. Now, therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands,\\nbut at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and\\nprovide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm of darkness;\\nthe fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the sooner, and the\\npeople shall turn again to their own labours.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste\\nto prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so\\nthat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had had enough to eat\\nand drink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but\\nthe son of Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of\\nthe sounding sea, in an open place where the waves came surging in\\none after another. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and\\neased the burden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing\\nHector round windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew\\nnear him, like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of\\nhis beaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit\\nhovered over his head and said- \\n\\n\"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living,\\nbut now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all\\nspeed that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows\\nof men that can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will\\nnot yet suffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander\\nall desolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now\\nyour hand I pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire,\\nnever shall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermore\\nshall we sit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the cruel\\nfate which was my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me-\\nnay, you too Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the\\nwall of the noble Trojans. \\n\\n\"One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not my\\nbones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as we\\nwere brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought\\nme to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed\\nthe son of Amphidamas- not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel\\nover the dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated\\nme kindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones\\nlie in but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you\\nby your mother.\" \\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Why, true heart, are you come hither to lay\\nthese charges upon me? will of my own self do all as you have bidden\\nme. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around one\\nanother, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows.\"\\n\\nHe opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped\\nhim in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a vapour,\\ngibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet,\\nsmote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, \"Of a truth even\\nin the house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have no life\\nin them; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus has hovered over\\nhead making piteous moan, telling me what I am to do for him, and\\nlooking wondrously like himself.\" \\n\\nThus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning\\nabout the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then King\\nAgamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring\\nwood, and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them.\\nThey went out with woodmen\\'s axes and strong ropes in their hands,\\nand before them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go,\\nby straight ways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of\\nmany-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a tall\\nbranching oak that came thundering down as they felled it. They split\\nthe trees and bound them behind the mules, which then wended their\\nway as they best could through the thick brushwood on to the plain.\\nAll who had been cutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire to\\nIdomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a line upon\\nthe seashore at the place where Achilles would make a mighty monument\\nfor Patroclus and for himself. \\n\\nWhen they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole\\nground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles ordered\\nhis brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man\\nhis horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted\\neach his chariot- they and their charioteers with them. The chariots\\nwent before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their\\ntens of thousands after. In the midst of them his comrades bore Patroclus\\nand covered him with the locks of their hair which they cut off and\\nthrew upon his body. Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow,\\nso noble a comrade was he taking to the house of Hades. \\n\\nWhen they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they laid\\nthe body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought him of\\nanother matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the\\nyellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He looked\\nall sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, \"Spercheius, in vain\\ndid my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to my loved\\nnative land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb;\\nfifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your springs, where\\nis your grove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did\\nmy father vow, but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore,\\nthat I shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to\\nthe hero Patroclus.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and\\nall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun\\nwould have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently\\nsaid to Agamemnon, \"Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people\\nwill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from mourning;\\nbid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their dinners:\\nwe, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is wanted here,\\nand let the other princes also stay by me.\" \\n\\nWhen King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships,\\nbut those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre\\na hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfully\\nupon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen\\nbefore the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped\\nthe body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all\\nround it. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and\\nunguents; four proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning\\nthe while he did so. The dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them\\ndid Achilles slay and threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave\\nsons of noble Trojans to the sword and laid them with the rest, for\\nhe was full of bitterness and fury. Then he committed all to the resistless\\nand devouring might of the fire; he groaned aloud and callid on his\\ndead comrade by name. \"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus, even in the\\nhouse of Hades; I am now doing all that I have promised you. Twelve\\nbrave sons of noble Trojans shall the flames consume along with yourself,\\nbut dogs, not fire, shall devour the flesh of Hector son of Priam.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector,\\nfor Jove\\'s daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and anointed\\nhim with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn when\\nAchilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark\\ncloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place where\\nHector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.\\n\\nNow the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles therefore\\nbethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the two\\nwinds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He made them\\nmany drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come\\nand help him that the wood might make haste to kindle and the dead\\nbodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and started off to\\nfetch the winds. They were holding high feast in the house of boisterous\\nZephyrus when Iris came running up to the stone threshold of the house\\nand stood there, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came\\ntowards her and each of them called her to him, but Iris would not\\nsit down. \"I cannot stay,\" she said, \"I must go back to the streams\\nof Oceanus and the land of the Ethiopians who are offering hecatombs\\nto the immortals, and I would have my share; but Achilles prays that\\nBoreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly\\nofferings; he would have you blow upon the pyre of Patroclus for whom\\nall the Achaeans are lamenting.\" \\n\\nWith this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent\\nthe air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until\\nthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when\\nthey reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared\\nunder the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard\\nand beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his\\ndouble cup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon\\nthe spirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until\\nthe earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the\\nbones of his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his\\nparents, even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his\\ncomrade, pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.\\n\\nAt length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light which\\nsaffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames\\nfell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the\\nThracian sea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son\\nof Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with\\ntoil, till he fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who were about\\nthe son of Atreus drew near in a body, and roused him with the noise\\nand tramp of their coming. He sat upright and said, \"Son of Atreus,\\nand all other princes of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere\\nupon the fire and quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroclus\\nson of Menoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found,\\nfor they lie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men and\\nhorses, has been thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge. We\\nwill lay the bones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against\\nthe time when I shall myself go down into the house of Hades. As for\\nthe barrow, labour not to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable.\\nAfterwards, let those Achaeans who may be left at the ships when I\\nam gone, build it both broad and high.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First\\nthey poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the\\nfire. With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their\\nloved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat:\\nthey then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the\\ntent. They marked off the circle where the barrow should be, made\\na foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth.\\nWhen they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but Achilles\\nstayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He brought prizes\\nfrom the ships-cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women\\nwith fair girdles, and swart iron. \\n\\nThe first prize he offered was for the chariot races- a woman skilled\\nin all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears for\\nhandles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man\\nwho came in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken,\\nand in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron that\\nhad never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left\\nthe maker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize was two\\ntalents of gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by\\nsmoke. Then he stood up and spoke among the Argives saying-\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that\\nlie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I\\nshould carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know\\nhow far my steeds excel all others- for they are immortal; Neptune\\ngave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself;\\nbut I shall hold aloof, I and my steeds that have lost their brave\\nand kind driver, who many a time has washed them in clear water and\\nanointed their manes with oil. See how they stand weeping here, with\\ntheir manes trailing on the ground in the extremity of their sorrow.\\nBut do you others set yourselves in order throughout the host, whosoever\\nhas confidence in his horses and in the strength of his chariot.\"\\n\\nThus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred\\nthemselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son\\nof Admetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty\\nDiomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken\\nfrom Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him, yellow-haired\\nMenelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses, Agamemnon\\'s\\nmare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The mare had been given to\\nAgamemnon by echepolus son of Anchises, that he might not have to\\nfollow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and take his ease; for\\nJove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in spacious Sicyon.\\nThis mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus put under the yoke.\\n\\nFourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus, made\\nready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came up\\nto him to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but\\nlittle need. \"Antilochus,\" said Nestor, \"you are young, but Jove and\\nNeptune have loved you well, and have made you an excellent horseman.\\nI need not therefore say much by way of instruction. You are skilful\\nat wheeling your horses round the post, but the horses themselves\\nare very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your chances.\\nThe other drivers know less than you do, but their horses are fleeter;\\ntherefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice whereby\\nyou may insure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers.\\nThe woodman does more by skill than by brute force; by skill the pilot\\nguides his storm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by skill one driver\\ncan beat another. If a man go wide in rounding this way and that,\\nwhereas a man who knows what he is doing may have worse horses, but\\nhe will keep them well in hand when he sees the doubling-post; he\\nknows the precise moment at which to pull the rein, and keeps his\\neye well on the man in front of him. I will give you this certain\\ntoken which cannot escape your notice. There is a stump of a dead\\ntree-oak or pine as it may be- some six feet above the ground, and\\nnot yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork of the road; it\\nhas two white stones set one on each side, and there is a clear course\\nall round it. It may have been a monument to some one long since dead,\\nor it may have been used as a doubling-post in days gone by; now,\\nhowever, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark round which\\nthe chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, but as you stand\\nin your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge on your right-hand\\nhorse with voice and lash, and give him a loose rein, but let the\\nleft-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave of your wheel shall\\nalmost graze the post; but mind the stone, or you will wound your\\nhorses and break your chariot in pieces, which would be sport for\\nothers but confusion for yourself. Therefore, my dear son, mind well\\nwhat you are about, for if you can be first to round the post there\\nis no chance of any one giving you the goby later, not even though\\nyou had Adrestus\\'s horse Arion behind you horse which is of divine\\nrace- or those of Laomedon, which are the noblest in this country.\"\\n\\nWhen Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in\\nhis place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They\\nthen all mounted their chariots and cast lots.- Achilles shook the\\nhelmet, and the lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next\\ncame that of King Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of\\nAtreus and of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son\\nof Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took their places\\nin line; Achilles showed them the doubling-post round which they were\\nto turn, some way off upon the plain; here he stationed his father\\'s\\nfollower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and report truly.\\n\\nAt the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck them\\nwith the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. They flew\\nfull speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from\\nunder them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all\\nflying in the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the\\nground, and then again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood\\nerect, and their hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of victory.\\nEach kept calling on his horses, and the horses scoured the plain\\namid the clouds of dust that they raised. \\n\\nIt was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way\\nback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and\\nit was seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres\\nnow took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions\\nof Diomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus\\'s chariot, and\\nhe could feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders,\\nfor their heads were close to him as they flew over the course. Diomed\\nwould have now passed him, or there would have been a dead heat, but\\nPhoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip. Tears of anger\\nfell from his eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than ever,\\nwhile his own horses lost ground through his having no whip. Minerva\\nsaw the trick which Apollo had played the son of Tydeus, so she brought\\nhim his whip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went after\\nthe son of Admetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him; the mares\\nwent one to one side the course, and the other to the other, and the\\npole was broken against the ground. Eumelus was thrown from his chariot\\nclose to the wheel; his elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all torn,\\nand his forehead was bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with\\ntears and he could find no utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned\\nhis horses aside and shot far ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength\\ninto them and covered Diomed himself with glory. \\n\\nMenelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called\\nto his father\\'s horses. \"On with you both,\" he cried, \"and do your\\nvery utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of\\nTydeus, for Minerva has put running into them, and has covered Diomed\\nwith glory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of Atreus\\nand not be left behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. Why,\\nmy good fellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shall surely\\nbe- Nestor will keep neither of you, but will put both of you to the\\nsword, if we win any the worse a prize through your carelessness,\\nfly after them at your utmost speed; I will hit on a plan for passing\\nthem in a narrow part of the way, and it shall not fail me.\"\\n\\nThey feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went\\nquicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road had\\nsunk. The ground was broken, for the winter\\'s rain had gathered and\\nhad worn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was\\nmaking towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but\\nAntilochus turned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little\\non one side. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out, \"Antilochus,\\nyou are driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow\\nhere, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then; if you foul\\nmy chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.\" \\n\\nBut Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had\\nnot heard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young\\nman can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his strength,\\nand then Menelaus\\'s mares drew behind, for he left off driving for\\nfear the horses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus,\\nwhile pressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong\\nto the ground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus and said, \"There\\nis no greater trickster living than you are; go, and bad luck go with\\nyou; the Achaeans say not well that you have understanding, and come\\nwhat may you shall not bear away the prize without sworn protest on\\nmy part.\" \\n\\nThen he called on his horses and said to them, \"Keep your pace, and\\nslacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner than\\nyours, for they are neither of them young.\" \\n\\nThe horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so\\nthat they were soon nearly up with the others. \\n\\nMeanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses\\nwent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust. Idomeneus\\ncaptain of the Cretans was first to make out the running, for he was\\nnot in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commanding part\\nof the ground. The driver was a long way off, but Idomeneus could\\nhear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly-\\na chestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on its forehead.\\nHe stood up and said among the Argives, \"My friends, princes and counsellors\\nof the Argives, can you see the running as well as I can? There seems\\nto be another pair in front now, and another driver; those that led\\noff at the start must have been disabled out on the plain. I saw them\\nat first making their way round the doubling-post, but now, though\\nI search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. Perhaps the reins\\nfell from the driver\\'s hand so that he lost command of his horses\\nat the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he must have\\nbeen thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his mares have\\nleft the course and gone off wildly in a panic. Come up and see for\\nyourselves, I cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems an\\nAetolian by descent, ruler over the Argives, brave Diomed the son\\nof Tydeus.\" \\n\\nAjax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, \"Idomeneus, why\\nshould you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the mares\\nare still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the youngest,\\nnor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down\\nthe law. You have no right to do so, for there are better men here\\nthan you are. Eumelus\\'s horses are in front now, as they always have\\nbeen, and he is on the chariot holding the reins.\" \\n\\nThe captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, \"Ajax you are\\nan excellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in\\nmuch else as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a\\ntripod or cauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose\\nhorses are first. You will then know to your cost.\" \\n\\nAjax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there would\\nhave been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles risen\\nin his place and said, \"Cease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus; it\\nis not you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like:\\nsit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towards\\nthe winning-post and will be bere directly. You will then both of\\nyou know whose horses are first, and whose come after.\" \\n\\nAs he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his\\nwhip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they\\nflew over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver,\\nand the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet\\nhorses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and\\nthe horses came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them\\nin the middle of the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests\\nfell in streams on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his goodly\\nchariot, and leaned his whip against his horses\\' yoke; brave Sthenelus\\nnow lost no time, but at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman\\nand the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. Then he\\nunyoked the horses. \\n\\nNext after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had passed\\nMenelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even\\nso Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse\\nthat draws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse\\'s\\ntail touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much space between\\nwheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus was no further\\nthan this behind Antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc\\'s\\nthrow behind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon\\'s\\nmare Aethe kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course\\nhad been longer he would have passed him, and there would not even\\nhave been a dead heat. Idomeneus\\'s brave squire Meriones was about\\na spear\\'s cast behind Menelaus. His horses were slowest of all, and\\nhe was the worst driver. Last of them all came the son of Admetus,\\ndragging his chariot and driving his horses on in front. When Achilles\\nsaw him he was sorry, and stood up among the Argives saying, \"The\\nbest man is coming in last. Let us give him a prize for it is reasonable.\\nHe shall have the second, but the first must go to the son of Tydeus.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying,\\nand were for doing as he had said, but Nestor\\'s son Antilochus stood\\nup and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. \"Achilles,\" said\\nhe, \"I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob\\nme of my prize, because you think Eumelus\\'s chariot and horses were\\nthrown out, and himself too, good man that he is. He should have prayed\\nduly to the immortals; he would not have come in fast if he had done\\nso. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in\\nyour tents, with bronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something\\nfrom this store if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you,\\nand give him a better prize even than that which you have now offered;\\nbut I will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her,\\nlet him come on.\" \\n\\nAchilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus,\\nwho was one of his dearest comrades. So he said- \\n\\n\"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will\\ngive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round\\nit which I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him.\"\\n\\nHe bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent,\\nand he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received\\nit gladly. \\n\\nBut Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An\\nattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep\\nsilence: the hero then addressed them. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"what\\nis this from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me\\ncut a poor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front\\nof them, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O princes\\nand counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show no favour,\\nlest one of the Achaeans say, \\'Menelaus has got the mare through lying\\nand corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilochus\\'s, but\\nhe has greater weight and influence.\\' Nay, I will determine the matter\\nmyself, and no man will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come\\nhere, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before\\nyour chariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by\\nearth-encircling Neptune that you did not purposely and guilefully\\nget in the way of my horses.\" \\n\\nAnd Antilochus answered, \"Forgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaus,\\nthan you are; you stand higher than I do and are the better man of\\nthe two; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion;\\ntheir tempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make due\\nallowances therefore, and bear with me; I will of my own accord give\\nup the mare that I have won, and if you claim any further chattel\\nfrom my own possessions, I would rather yield it to you, at once,\\nthan fall from your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the sight\\nof heaven.\" \\n\\nThe son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaus,\\nwhose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field of ripening\\ncorn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest- even so, O Menelaus,\\nwas your heart made glad within you. He turned to Antilochus and said,\\n\"Now, Antilochus, angry though I have been, I can give way to you\\nof my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor ill-disposed\\nhitherto, but this time your youth has got the better of your judgement;\\nbe careful how you outwit your betters in future; no one else could\\nhave brought me round so easily, but your good father, your brother,\\nand yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my behalf; I\\ntherefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare to you,\\nmine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that I am neither\\nharsh nor vindictive.\" \\n\\nWith this he gave the mare over to Antilochus\\'s comrade Noemon, and\\nthen took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth, carried\\noff the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled\\nurn, being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him\\namong the assembled Argives and saying, \"Take this, my good old friend,\\nas an heirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus- for you shall\\nsee him no more among the Argives. I give you this prize though you\\ncannot win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot\\nenter for the javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has\\nbeen laid heavily upon you.\" \\n\\nSo saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and\\nanswered, \"My son, all that you have said is true; there is no strength\\nnow in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from either\\nshoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as when the Epeans\\nwere burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons offered prizes\\nin his honour. There was then none that could vie with me neither\\nof the Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing\\nI overcame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron\\nwho had come forward against me. Iphiclus was a good runner, but I\\nbeat him, and threw farther with my spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus.\\nIn chariot-racing alone did the two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding\\ntheir horses in front of me, for they were angry at the way victory\\nhad gone, and at the greater part of the prizes remaining in the place\\nin which they had been offered. They were twins, and the one kept\\non holding the reins, and holding the reins, while the other plied\\nthe whip. Such was I then, but now I must leave these matters to younger\\nmen; I must bow before the weight of years, but in those days I was\\neminent among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests\\nin honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart\\nrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill\\ntowards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all\\nwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance.\"\\n\\nThereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks\\nof Nestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and presently\\noffered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He brought\\nout a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the crowd- a\\nshe-mule never yet broken, but six years old- when it is hardest of\\nall to break them: this was for the victor, and for the vanquished\\nhe offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said among the Argives,\\n\"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite our two champion\\nboxers to lay about them lustily and compete for these prizes. He\\nto whom Apollo vouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom the Achaeans\\nacknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back with him to his own\\ntent, while he that is vanquished shall have the double cup.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and great stature,\\na skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand on the mule\\nand said, \"Let the man who is to have the cup come hither, for none\\nbut myself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all here present,\\nand none can beat me. Is it not enough that I should fall short of\\nyou in actual fighting? Still, no man can be good at everything. I\\ntell you plainly, and it shall come true; if any man will box with\\nme I will bruise his body and break his bones; therefore let his friends\\nstay here in a body and be at hand to take him away when I have done\\nwith him.\" \\n\\nThey all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of Mecisteus,\\nwho was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes after the fall\\nof Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people of Cadmus.\\nThe son of Tydeus was Euryalus\\'s second, cheering him on and hoping\\nheartily that he would win. First he put a waistband round him and\\nthen he gave him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being\\nnow girt went into the middle of the ring, and immediately fell to;\\nheavily indeed did they punish one another and lay about them with\\ntheir brawny fists. One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws,\\nand they sweated from every pore of their skin. Presently Epeus came\\non and gave Euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round; Euryalus\\ncould not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a moment and he\\nsprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the air near some shore\\nthat is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the\\nwaves, and then falls back into deep water. But noble Epeus caught\\nhold of him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and\\nled him from the ring, unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one\\nside, and spitting great clots of gore. They set him down in a swoon\\nand then went to fetch the double cup. \\n\\nThe son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest\\nand showed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of\\nwrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting\\nupon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelve\\noxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of\\narts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the\\nArgives, \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"\\n\\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty Ulysses,\\nfull of wiles rose also. The two girded themselves and went into the\\nmiddle of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong hands\\nlike the rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof of\\na high house to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as they\\ntugged at one another with their mighty arms- and sweat rained from\\nthem in torrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and\\nshoulders, but they kept on striving with might and main for victory\\nand to win the tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him;\\nUlysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire\\nof watching them, Ajax said to ulysses, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,\\nyou shall either lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between\\nus.\" \\n\\nHe lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not forget\\nhis cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee, so that\\nhe could not keep his feet, but fell on his back with Ulysses lying\\nupon his chest, and all who saw it marvelled. Then Ulysses in turn\\nlifted Ajax and stirred him a little from the ground but could not\\nlift him right off it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side\\nby side on the ground and were all begrimed with dust. They now sprang\\ntowards one another and were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles\\nrose and stayed them. \"Put not each other further,\" said he, \"to such\\ncruel suffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you\\nan equal prize, and let the other Achaeans now compete.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their\\nshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.\\n\\nThe son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running- a mixing-bowl\\nbeautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six measures, and\\nfar exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; it was the\\nwork of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been brought into port\\nby Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present of it to\\nThoas. Eueneus son of jason had given it to Patroclus in ransom of\\nPriam\\'s son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prize in honour\\nof his comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. For the second\\nprize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for the last there\\nwas to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said among the Argives,\\n\"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\" \\n\\nForthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, and\\nNestor\\'s son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of\\nhis time. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal.\\nThe course was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son\\nof Oileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him\\nas the shuttle is to a woman\\'s bosom when she throws the woof across\\nthe warp and holds it close up to her; even so close behind him was\\nUlysses- treading in his footprints before the dust could settle there,\\nand Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as he ran swiftly\\non. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straining his\\nutmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were now\\nnearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to Minerva.\\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"and help my feet, O goddess.\" Thus did he pray,\\nand Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet\\nfeel light, and when the runners were at the point of pouncing upon\\nthe prize, Ajax, through Minerva\\'s spite slipped upon some offal that\\nwas lying there from the cattle which Achilles had slaughtered in\\nhonour of Patroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with\\ncow dung. Ulysses therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got\\nbefore Ajax and came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with\\nhis hand on one of its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth.\\nThen he said to the Argives, \"Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running;\\nshe watches over Ulysses and stands by him as though she were his\\nown mother.\" Thus did he speak and they all of them laughed heartily.\\n\\nAntilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the\\nbystanders, \"You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown\\ntheir respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and\\nas for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale\\nin spite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against\\nhim save only Achilles.\" \\n\\nHe said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and Achilles\\nanswered, \"Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no purpose;\\nI shall give you an additional half talent of gold.\" He then gave\\nthe half talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly. \\n\\nThen the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that\\nhad been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus.\\nHe stood up and said among the Argives, \"We bid two champions put\\non their armour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another\\nin the presence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound\\nthe flesh of the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to\\nhim will I give this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which\\nI took from Asteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership,\\nand I will give each of them a hearty meal in my own tent.\"\\n\\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty Diomed\\nson of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his own side\\nof the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and with\\nfire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled as they beheld\\nthem, and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice\\ndid they spring forward and thrice try to strike each other in close\\ncombat. Ajax pierced Diomed\\'s round shield, but did not draw blood,\\nfor the cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son\\nof Tydeus from over his huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax\\'s\\nneck with the point of his spear, and the Achaeans alarmed for his\\nsafety bade them leave off fighting and divide the prize between them.\\nAchilles then gave the great sword to the son of Tydeus, with its\\nscabbard, and the leathern belt with which to hang it. \\n\\nAchilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had\\nerewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carried\\nit off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said\\namong the Argives, \"Stand forward, you who would essay this contest.\\nHe who wins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years\\nas they go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town\\nhis shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron,\\nfor he will have a stock of it on his own premises.\" \\n\\nThen uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax\\nson of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other\\nand Epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which\\nset all the Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race\\nof Mars. Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond\\nany mark that had been made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the\\nquoit he hurled it as though it had been a stockman\\'s stick which\\nhe sends flying about among his cattle when he is driving them, so\\nfar did his throw out-distance those of the others. All who saw it\\nroared applause, and his comrades carried the prize for him and set\\nit on board his ship. \\n\\nAchilles next offered a prize of iron for archery- ten double-edged\\naxes and ten with single eddies: he set up a ship\\'s mast, some way\\noff upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by\\nthe foot; this was what they were to aim at. \"Whoever,\" he said, \"can\\nhit the pigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with him;\\nhe who hits the string without hitting the bird will have taken a\\nworse aim and shall have the single-edged axes.\" \\n\\nThen uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of Idomeneus\\nrose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of Teucer\\nfell first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promise\\nhecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and missed his bird,\\nfor Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird\\nwas tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so\\nthat it hung down towards the ground, while the bird flew up into\\nthe sky, and the Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who had his\\narrow ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand,\\nand at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling\\nlambs to Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under\\nthe clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling\\nupwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in\\nthe ground at Meriones\\' feet, but the bird perched on the ship\\'s mast\\nhanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went\\nout of her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore,\\ntook all ten double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged\\nones to his ships. \\n\\nThen the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had\\nnever been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a\\npattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up- to\\nwit the son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart\\nsquire of Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, \"Son of Atreus, we\\nknow how far you excel all others both in power and in throwing the\\njavelin; take the cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it\\nso please you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this at least is\\nwhat I should myself wish.\" \\n\\nKing Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones,\\nand handed the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK XXIV\\n\\nThe assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to\\nhis own ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethought\\nthem of the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept for thinking\\nof his dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow, could\\ntake no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn as he yearned\\nafter the might and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of all they\\nhad done together, and all they had gone through both on the field\\nof battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on these\\nthings he wept bitterly and lay now on his side, now on his back,\\nand now face downwards, till at last he rose and went out as one distraught\\nto wander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawn breaking over\\nbeach and sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, and bound the body\\nof Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice did he drag\\nit round the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went back into\\nhis tent, leaving the body on the ground full length and with its\\nface downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured, for\\nhe pitied the man, dead though he now was; therefore he shielded him\\nwith his golden aegis continually, that he might take no hurt while\\nAchilles was dragging him. \\n\\nThus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but the\\nblessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury, slayer\\nof Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save only Juno,\\nNeptune, and Jove\\'s grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the hate\\nwhich they had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and his people;\\nfor they forgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus in disdaining\\nthe goddesses who came to him when he was in his sheepyards, and preferring\\nher who had offered him a wanton to his ruin. \\n\\nWhen, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come, Phoebus\\nApollo spoke among the immortals saying, \"You gods ought to be ashamed\\nof yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not Hector burn\\nyou thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And now dare\\nyou not rescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon, with\\nhis mother and child, his father Priam, and his people, who would\\nforthwith commit him to the flames, and give him his due funeral rites?\\nSo, then, you would all be on the side of mad Achilles, who knows\\nneither right nor ruth? He is like some savage lion that in the pride\\nof his great strength and daring springs upon men\\'s flocks and gorges\\non them. Even so has Achilles flung aside all pity, and all that conscience\\nwhich at once so greatly banes yet greatly boons him that will heed\\nit. man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost- a son, it\\nmay be, or a brother born from his own mother\\'s womb; yet when he\\nhas mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes\\nmuch sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has slain\\nnoble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb of his comrade.\\nIt were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so, for\\nbrave though he be we gods may take it ill that he should vent his\\nfury upon dead clay.\" \\n\\nJuno spoke up in a rage. \"This were well,\" she cried, \"O lord of the\\nsilver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles;\\nbut Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman\\'s breast, whereas Achilles\\nis the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared and brought up.\\nI married her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to the immortals;\\nyou gods came all of you to her wedding; you feasted along with them\\nyourself and brought your lyre- false, and fond of low company, that\\nyou have ever been.\" \\n\\nThen said Jove, \"Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not be\\nequal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods,\\nas also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was my\\naltar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour of\\nsacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body\\nof mighty Hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without\\nAchilles coming to know it, for his mother keeps night and day beside\\nhim. Let some one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and I will\\nimpart my counsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept a ransom\\nfrom Priam, and give up the body.\" \\n\\nOn this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Down\\nshe plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus;\\nthe waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the bottom\\nas the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry death\\nto fishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with the other\\nsea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midst of them\\nweeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his own land, on\\nthe rich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said, \"Rise Thetis;\\nJove, whose counsels fail not, bids you come to him.\" And Thetis answered,\\n\"Why does the mighty god so bid me? I am in great grief, and shrink\\nfrom going in and out among the immortals. Still, I will go, and the\\nword that he may speak shall not be spoken in vain.\" \\n\\nThe goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe more\\nsombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her.\\nThe waves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the\\nshore they flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing\\nson of Saturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near\\nhim. Minerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side\\nof father Jove. Juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and\\nspoke to her in words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her\\nback the cup; and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\\n\\n\"So, goddess,\" said he, \"for all your sorrow, and the grief that I\\nwell know reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to Olympus,\\nand I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days past the\\nimmortals have been quarrelling about Achilles waster of cities and\\nthe body of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer of Argus steal\\nthe body, but in furtherance of our peace and amity henceforward,\\nI will concede such honour to your son as I will now tell you. Go,\\nthen, to the host and lay these commands upon him; say that the gods\\nare angry with him, and that I am myself more angry than them all,\\nin that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not give him up. He\\nmay thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time I will send\\nIris to great Priam to bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans, and\\nransom his son, taking with him such gifts for Achilles as may give\\nhim satisfaction. \\n\\nSilver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith down\\nshe darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to her son\\'s\\ntents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty comrades\\nround him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which they had\\nkilled a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside him and caressed\\nhim with her hand saying, \"My son, how long will you keep on thus\\ngrieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart, and think\\nneither of food nor of woman\\'s embraces; and yet these too were well,\\nfor you have no long time to live, and death with the strong hand\\nof fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heed what I\\nsay, for I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods are\\nangry with you, and himself more angry than them all, in that you\\nkeep Hector at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let him\\ngo, and accept a ransom for his body.\" \\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion\\nthus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away.\"\\n\\nThus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse\\nwith one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to the strong\\ncity of Ilius. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, from the mansions of Olympus,\\nand tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships of the\\nAchaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take such gifts\\nwith him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he is to go alone,\\nwith no other Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may drive\\nhis mules and waggon, and bring back the body of him whom noble Achilles\\nhas slain. Let him have no thought nor fear of death in his heart,\\nfor we will send the slayer of Argus to escort him, and bring him\\nwithin the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill him nor let another\\ndo so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he will\\nentreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\" \\n\\nOn this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message.\\nShe went to Priam\\'s house, and found weeping and lamentation therein.\\nHis sons were seated round their father in the outer courtyard, and\\ntheir raiment was wet with tears: the old man sat in the midst of\\nthem with his mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and\\nneck all covered with the filth which he had clutched as he lay grovelling\\nin the mire. His daughters and his sons\\' wives went wailing about\\nthe house, as they thought of the many and brave men who lay dead,\\nslain by the Argives. The messenger of Jove stood by Priam and spoke\\nsoftly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so. \"Take heart,\"\\nshe said, \"Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and fear not. I\\nbring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards you. I come as a\\nmessenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takes thought for\\nyou and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom noble\\nHector, and take with you such gifts as shall give satisfaction to\\nAchilles. You are to go alone, with no Trojan, save only some honoured\\nservant who may drive your mules and waggon, and bring back to the\\ncity the body of him whom noble Achilles has slain. You are to have\\nno thought, nor fear of death, for Jove will send the slayer of Argus\\nto escort you. When he has brought you within Achilles\\' tent, Achilles\\nwill not kill you nor let another do so, for he will take heed to\\nhis ways and sin not, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable\\ncourtesy.\" \\n\\nIris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his sons\\nto get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon fast\\nupon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant store-room,\\nhigh-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many treasures were\\nkept, and he called Hecuba his wife. \"Wife,\" said he, \"a messenger\\nhas come to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to the ships of\\nthe Achaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts as shall\\ngive satisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter? for\\nmy own part I am greatly moved to pass through the of the Achaeans\\nand go to their ships.\" \\n\\nHis wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, \"Alas, what has become\\nof that judgement for which you have been ever famous both among strangers\\nand your own people? How can you venture alone to the ships of the\\nAchaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many of your\\nbrave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the cruel savage sees\\nyou and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity. Let\\nus then weep Hector from afar here in our own house, for when I gave\\nhim birth the threads of overruling fate were spun for him that dogs\\nshould eat his flesh far from his parents, in the house of that terrible\\nman on whose liver I would fain fasten and devour it. Thus would I\\navenge my son, who showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him, and\\nthought neither of Right nor of avoiding battle as he stood in defence\\nof Trojan men and Trojan women.\" \\n\\nThen Priam said, \"I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a\\nbird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it been\\nsome mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines\\nfrom sacrifice- I should have deemed him false and have given him\\nno heed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to face,\\ntherefore I will go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be\\nmy fate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it;\\nlet Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my son in my arms\\nand mourned him to my heart\\'s comforting.\" \\n\\nSo saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve goodly\\nvestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs,\\ntwelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed out\\nten talents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods, four\\ncauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given\\nhim when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious,\\nbut he grudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of\\nhis son. Then he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebuked\\nthem with words of anger. \"Out,\" he cried, \"shame and disgrace to\\nme that you are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are\\ncome to plague me here? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son\\nof Saturn has sent this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my\\nsons? Nay, you shall prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans\\nwill have easier work in killing you. As for me, let me go down within\\nthe house of Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of\\nthe city.\" \\n\\nHe drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old\\nman sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus, Paris,\\nnoble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud battle-cry,\\nDeiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the old man call near\\nhim. \"Come to me at once,\" he cried, \"worthless sons who do me shame;\\nwould that you had all been killed at the ships rather than Hector.\\nMiserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons in all Troy-\\nnoble Nestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hector who was\\na god among men, so that one would have thought he was son to an immortal-\\nyet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain them and those of\\nwhom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light of foot, heroes\\nof the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own people, why\\ndo you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and put all these things\\nupon it that I may set out on my way?\" \\n\\nThus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. They\\nbrought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of\\nthe waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on\\nwhich it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and\\nrings for the reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band eleven\\ncubits long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the\\nfar end of the pole, and put the ring over the upright pin making\\nit fast with three turns of the band on either side the knob, and\\nbending the thong of the yoke beneath it. This done, they brought\\nfrom the store-chamber the rich ransom that was to purchase the body\\nof Hector, and they set it all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked\\nthe strong harness-mules which the Mysians had on a time given as\\na goodly present to Priam; but for Priam himself they yoked horses\\nwhich the old king had bred, and kept for own use. \\n\\nThus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of their\\ncars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with a\\ngolden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a drink-offering\\nbefore they set out. She stood in front of the horses and said, \"Take\\nthis, make a drink-offering to father Jove, and since you are minded\\nto go to the ships in spite of me, pray that you may come safely back\\nfrom the hands of your enemies. Pray to the son of Saturn lord of\\nthe whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks down over all Troy, pray\\nhim to send his swift messenger on your right hand, the bird of omen\\nwhich is strongest and most dear to him of all birds, that you may\\nsee it with your own eyes and trust it as you go forth to the ships\\nof the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will not send you this messenger,\\nhowever set upon it you may be, I would not have you go to the ships\\nof the Argives.\" \\n\\nAnd Priam answered, \"Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well\\nto lift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me.\"\\n\\nWith this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over\\nhis hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He washed\\nhis hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offering\\nand prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his\\neyes to heaven. \"Father Jove,\" he said, \"that rulest from Ida, most\\nglorious and most great, grant that I may be received kindly and compassionately\\nin the tents of Achilles; and send your swift messenger upon my right\\nhand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to you of\\nall birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as I go\\nforth to the ships of the Danaans.\" \\n\\nSo did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer. Forthwith\\nhe sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds that fly,\\nthe dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings were\\nspread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and well-bolted\\ndoor of a rich man\\'s chamber. He came to them flying over the city\\nupon their right hands, and when they saw him they were glad and their\\nhearts took comfort within them. The old man made haste to mount his\\nchariot, and drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing\\ngatehouse of the outer court. Before him went the mules drawing the\\nfour-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise Idaeus; behind these were\\nthe horses, which the old man lashed with his whip and drove swiftly\\nthrough the city, while his friends followed after, wailing and lamenting\\nfor him as though he were on his road to death. As soon as they had\\ncome down from the city and had reached the plain, his sons and sons-in-law\\nwho had followed him went back to Ilius. \\n\\nBut Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not escape\\nthe ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old man and pitied\\nhim; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, \"Mercury, for it is\\nyou who are the most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear\\nthose whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to the ships of\\nthe Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him nor take note\\nof him until he reach the son of Peleus.\" \\n\\nThus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did\\nas he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals\\nwith which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he took the\\nwand with which he seals men\\'s eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as\\nhe pleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to Troy and\\nto the Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of noble birth\\nin the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon\\nhis face. \\n\\nNow when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius,\\nthey stayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river,\\nfor the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw\\nMercury standing near them he said to Priam, \"Take heed, descendant\\nof Dardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a man\\nwho I think will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses,\\nor at least embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion upon\\nus? \\n\\nWhen he heard this the old man\\'s heart failed him, and he was in great\\nfear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on end\\nover his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and\\ntook him by the hand, saying, \"Whither, father, are you thus driving\\nyour mules and horses in the dead of night when other men are asleep?\\nAre you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard by you, so\\ncruel and relentless? Should some one of them see you bearing so much\\ntreasure through the darkness of the flying night, what would not\\nyour state then be? You are no longer young, and he who is with you\\nis too old to protect you from those who would attack you. For myself,\\nI will do you no harm, and I will defend you from any one else, for\\nyou remind me of my own father.\" \\n\\nAnd Priam answered, \"It is indeed as you say, my dear son; nevertheless\\nsome god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent such a wayfarer\\nas yourself to meet me so Opportunely; you are so comely in mien and\\nfigure, and your judgement is so excellent that you must come of blessed\\nparents.\" \\n\\nThen said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, all that\\nyou have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking\\nthis rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be\\nsafe, or are you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that your\\nson has fallen who was the bravest man among you and was never lacking\\nin battle with the Achaeans?\" \\n\\nAnd Priam said, \"Wo are you, my friend, and who are your parents,\\nthat you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?\"\\n\\nThe slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, \"Sir, you would\\nprove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a time have\\nI set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives to their\\nships and putting them to the sword. We stood still and marvelled,\\nfor Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered us not to\\nfight. I am his squire, and came with him in the same ship. I am a\\nMyrmidon, and my father\\'s name is Polyctor: he is a rich man and about\\nas old as you are; he has six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh.\\nWe cast lots, and it fell upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I\\nam now come from the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the\\nAchaeans will set battle in array about the city. They chafe at doing\\nnothing, and are so eager that their princes cannot hold them back.\"\\n\\nThen answered Priam, \"If you are indeed the squire of Achilles son\\nof Peleus, tell me now the Whole truth. Is my son still at the ships,\\nor has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his hounds?\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"neither hounds\\nnor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at the\\ntents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days that\\nhe has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms eaten\\nhim although they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags him\\ncruelly round the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him no\\nhurt. You should come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew, with\\nthe blood all washed away, and his wounds every one of them closed\\nthough many pierced him with their spears. Such care have the blessed\\ngods taken of your brave son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure.\"\\n\\nThe old man was comforted as he heard him and said, \"My son, see what\\na good thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals; for\\nas sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold\\nOlympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accept therefore\\nat my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with heaven\\'s help guide\\nme till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus.\" \\n\\nThen answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, you are\\ntempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me,\\nfor you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles\\nwhom I fear and hold it great guiltless to defraud, lest some evil\\npresently befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to\\nArgos itself, and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land,\\nthat no one should attack you through making light of him who was\\nwith you.\" \\n\\nThe bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing\\nthe whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses.\\nWhen they reached the trench and the wall that was before the ships,\\nthose who were on guard had just been getting their suppers, and the\\nslayer of Argus threw them all into a deep sleep. Then he drew back\\nthe bolts to open the gates, and took Priam inside with the treasure\\nhe had upon his waggon. Ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of\\nthe son of Peleus for which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they\\nhad built for their king; when they had built it they thatched it\\nwith coarse tussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain, and\\nall round it they made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes\\nset close together. The gate was barred with a single bolt of pine\\nwhich it took three men to force into its place, and three to draw\\nback so as to open the gate, but Achilles could draw it by himself.\\nMercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought in the treasure\\nthat he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Then he sprang\\nfrom the chariot on to the ground and said, \"Sir, it is I, immortal\\nMercury, that am come with you, for my father sent me to escort you.\\nI will now leave you, and will not enter into the presence of Achilles,\\nfor it might anger him that a god should befriend mortal men thus\\nopenly. Go you within, and embrace the knees of the son of Peleus:\\nbeseech him by his father, his lovely mother, and his son; thus you\\nmay move him.\" \\n\\nWith these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang from\\nhis chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in charge\\nof the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house\\nwhere Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him\\nwith his men seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero Automedon,\\nand Alcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance about his\\nperson, for he had but just done eating and drinking, and the table\\nwas still there. King Priam entered without their seeing him, and\\ngoing right up to Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed the dread\\nmurderous hands that had slain so many of his sons. \\n\\nAs when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have killed\\nsome one in his own country, and must fly to a great man\\'s protection\\nin a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so did Achilles\\nmarvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one to another and marvelled\\nalso, but Priam besought Achilles saying, \"Think of your father, O\\nAchilles like unto the gods, who is such even as I am, on the sad\\nthreshold of old age. It may be that those who dwell near him harass\\nhim, and there is none to keep war and ruin from him. Yet when he\\nhears of you being still alive, he is glad, and his days are full\\nof hope that he shall see his dear son come home to him from Troy;\\nbut I, wretched man that I am, had the bravest in all Troy for my\\nsons, and there is not one of them left. I had fifty sons when the\\nAchaeans came here; nineteen of them were from a single womb, and\\nthe others were borne to me by the women of my household. The greater\\npart of them has fierce Mars laid low, and Hector, him who was alone\\nleft, him who was the guardian of the city and ourselves, him have\\nyou lately slain; therefore I am now come to the ships of the Achaeans\\nto ransom his body from you with a great ransom. Fear, O Achilles,\\nthe wrath of heaven; think on your own father and have compassion\\nupon me, who am the more pitiable, for I have steeled myself as no\\nman yet has ever steeled himself before me, and have raised to my\\nlips the hand of him who slew my son.\" \\n\\nThus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he bethought\\nhim of his father. He took the old man\\'s hand and moved him gently\\naway. The two wept bitterly- Priam, as he lay at Achilles\\' feet, weeping\\nfor Hector, and Achilles now for his father and now for Patroclous,\\ntill the house was filled with their lamentation. But when Achilles\\nwas now sated with grief and had unburthened the bitterness of his\\nsorrow, he left his seat and raised the old man by the hand, in pity\\nfor his white hair and beard; then he said, \"Unhappy man, you have\\nindeed been greatly daring; how could you venture to come alone to\\nthe ships of the Achaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain\\nso many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon\\nthis seat, and for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts,\\nfor weeping will not avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the\\nlot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Jove\\'s palace\\nthere stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other\\nwith good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts\\nhe sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he\\nto whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger\\nof scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world,\\nand he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither\\nby gods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus; the gods endowed him\\nwith all good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over the\\nMyrmidons excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortal though\\nhe was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him too\\ndid heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal children\\nborn to him in his house, save one son who is doomed to die all untimely;\\nnor may I take care of him now that he is growing old, for I must\\nstay here at Troy to be the bane of you and your children. And you\\ntoo, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy. They say\\nthat in wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed all that is\\nin Lesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia that is more\\ninland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from the\\nday when the dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and slaughter\\nhave been about your city continually. Bear up against it, and let\\nthere be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may for your\\nbrave son, you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him from\\nthe dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall you.\"\\n\\nAnd Priam answered, \"O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector is\\nstill lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransom\\nwhich I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may look\\nupon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land\\nin safety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look upon\\nthe light of the sun.\" \\n\\nAchilles looked at him sternly and said, \"Vex me, sir, no longer;\\nI am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother, daughter\\nof the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid me deliver\\nit to you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannot hide it,\\nthat some god has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans, for else,\\nno man however strong and in his prime would dare to come to our host;\\nhe could neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of my gates\\nthus easily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sin against\\nthe word of Jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though you are, within\\nmy tents.\" \\n\\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang like\\na lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with him went\\nhis two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him than\\nany others of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. These unyoked\\nthe horses and mules, and bade Priam\\'s herald and attendant be seated\\nwithin the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector\\'s body from the\\nwaggon. but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, that Achilles\\nmight wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home. Then\\nhe called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint\\nit, but he first took it to a place where Priam should not see it,\\nlest if he did so, he should break out in the bitterness of his grief,\\nand enrage Achilles, who might then kill him and sin against the word\\nof Jove. When the servants had washed the body and anointed it, and\\nhad wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles himself lifted\\nit on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the waggon. He\\ncried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade,\\n\"Be not angry with me, Patroclus,\" he said, \"if you hear even in the\\nhouse of Hades that I have given Hector to his father for a ransom.\\nIt has been no unworthy one, and I will share it equitably with you.\"\\n\\nAchilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the richly\\ninlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at right\\nangles to the one against which Priam was sitting. \"Sir,\" he said,\\n\"your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according to desire;\\nyou shall look upon him when you him away at daybreak; for the present\\nlet us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think about eating,\\nthough her twelve children- six daughters and six lusty sons- had\\nbeen all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sons with arrows from\\nhis silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew the daughters, because\\nNiobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said Leto had borne two\\nchildren only, whereas she had herself borne many- whereon the two\\nkilled the many. Nine days did they lie weltering, and there was none\\nto bury them, for the son of Saturn turned the people into stone;\\nbut on the tenth day the gods in heaven themselves buried them, and\\nNiobe then took food, being worn out with weeping. They say that somewhere\\namong the rocks on the mountain pastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs\\nlive that haunt the river Achelous, there, they say, she lives in\\nstone and still nurses the sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven.\\nTherefore, noble sir, let us two now take food; you can weep for your\\ndear son hereafter as you are bearing him back to Ilius- and many\\na tear will he cost you.\" \\n\\nWith this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silvery\\nwhiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all in due order.\\nThey cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them,\\nand drew them off again when they were well roasted. Automedon brought\\nbread in fair baskets and served it round the table, while Achilles\\ndealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the good things that\\nwere before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\\nPriam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strength and beauty\\nof Achilles for he was as a god to see, and Achilles marvelled at\\nPriam as he listened to him and looked upon his noble presence. When\\nthey had gazed their fill Priam spoke first. \"And now, O king,\" he\\nsaid, \"take me to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed\\nboon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closed from the day your\\nhands took the life of my son; I have grovelled without ceasing in\\nthe mire of my stable-yard, making moan and brooding over my countless\\nsorrows. Now, moreover, I have eaten bread and drunk wine; hitherto\\nI have tasted nothing.\" \\n\\nAs he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds\\nin the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good red\\nrugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks\\nfor Priam and Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torch\\nand got the two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughingly\\nto Priam, \"Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of\\nthose who in due course keep coming to advise with me should see you\\nhere in the darkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon.\\nThis might cause delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell me\\nand tell me true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral\\nrites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and\\nrestrain the host.\" \\n\\nAnd Priam answered, \"Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble son\\nwith all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. You\\nknow how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch\\nwood from the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days, therefore,\\nwill we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day we will bury him\\nand there shall be a public feast in his honour; on the eleventh we\\nwill build a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth, if there be\\nneed, we will fight.\" \\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"All, King Priam, shall be as you have said.\\nI will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he laid his hand on the old man\\'s right wrist, in token\\nthat he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and his attendant\\nsleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while Achilles lay\\nin an inner room of the house, with fair Briseis by his side.\\n\\nAnd now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelong\\nnight, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck, sleep could\\ntake no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get King Priam\\naway from the ships without his being seen by the strong force of\\nsentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam\\'s head and said, \"Sir,\\nnow that Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear about\\nsleeping in the thick of your foes. You have paid a great ransom,\\nand have received the body of your son; were you still alive and a\\nprisoner the sons whom you have left at home would have to give three\\ntimes as much to free you; and so it would be if Agamemnon and the\\nother Achaeans were to know of your being here.\" \\n\\nWhen he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.\\nMercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly\\nthrough the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to\\nthe ford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury went\\nback to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to break over\\nall the land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the city lamenting\\nand making moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. No one neither\\nman nor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as golden Venus standing\\non Pergamus, caught sight of her dear father in his chariot, and his\\nservant that was the city\\'s herald with him. Then she saw him that\\nwas lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she\\nwent about the city saying, \"Come hither Trojans, men and women, and\\nlook on Hector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from battle\\nwhen he was alive, look now on him that was the glory of our city\\nand all our people.\" \\n\\nAt this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a sorrow\\nhad possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he was bringing\\nin the body. Hector\\'s wife and his mother were the first to mourn\\nhim: they flew towards the waggon and laid their hands upon his head,\\nwhile the crowd stood weeping round them. They would have stayed before\\nthe gates, weeping and lamenting the livelong day to the going down\\nof the sun, had not Priam spoken to them from the chariot and said,\\n\"Make way for the mules to pass you. Afterwards when I have taken\\nthe body home you shall have your fill of weeping.\" \\n\\nOn this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon. When\\nthey had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a bed and\\nseated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women joined\\nin the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them all Andromache\\nled their wailing as she clasped the head of mighty Hector in her\\nembrace. \"Husband,\" she cried, \"you have died young, and leave me\\nin your house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starred parents is\\nstill a mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood. Ere he can\\ndo so our city will be razed and overthrown, for you who watched over\\nit are no more- you who were its saviour, the guardian of our wives\\nand children. Our women will be carried away captives to the ships,\\nand I among them; while you, my child, who will be with me will be\\nput to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be,\\nsome Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, to\\navenge some brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of them\\nhave indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father\\'s hand in\\nbattle was no light one. Therefore do the people mourn him. You have\\nleft, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents, and my own grief\\nis greatest of all, for you did not stretch forth your arms and embrace\\nme as you lay dying, nor say to me any words that might have lived\\nwith me in my tears night and day for evermore.\" \\n\\nBitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.\\nHecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. \"Hector,\" she cried,\\n\"dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive the gods\\nloved you well, and even in death they have not been utterly unmindful\\nof you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, he would sell\\nhim beyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos; and when he\\nhad slain you too with his sword, many a time did he drag you round\\nthe sepulchre of his comrade- though this could not give him life-\\nyet here you lie all fresh as dew, and comely as one whom Apollo has\\nslain with his painless shafts.\" \\n\\nThus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and then\\nHelen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation. \"Hector,\"\\nsaid she, \"dearest of all my brothers-in-law-for I am wife to Alexandrus\\nwho brought me hither to Troy- would that I had died ere he did so-\\ntwenty years are come and gone since I left my home and came from\\nover the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult or unkindness\\nfrom you. When another would chide with me, as it might be one of\\nyour brothers or sisters or of your brothers\\' wives, or my mother-in-law-\\nfor Priam was as kind to me as though he were my own father- you would\\nrebuke and check them with words of gentleness and goodwill. Therefore\\nmy tears flow both for you and for my unhappy self, for there is no\\none else in Troy who is kind to me, but all shrink and shudder as\\nthey go by me.\" \\n\\nShe wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round her\\njoined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, \"Bring\\nwood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the Argives,\\nfor Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me his word\\nthat they should not attack us until the morning of the twelfth day.\"\\n\\nForthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together before\\nthe city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps wood, and on\\nthe morning of the tenth day with many tears they took trave Hector\\nforth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and set the\\nfire thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingered dawn appeared\\non the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre of\\nmighty Hector. When they were got together, they first quenched the\\nfire with wine wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and\\ncomrades with many a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped\\nthem in soft robes of purple, and laid them in a golden urn, which\\nthey placed in a grave and covered over with large stones set close\\ntogether. Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping guard\\non every side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they had\\nfinished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went back again\\ninto the city, and being well assembled they held high feast in the\\nhouse of Priam their king. \\n\\nThus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of horses.\\n\\nTHE END'"
