       "['Book XXI\\n\\nTHE TRIAL OF THE AXES, DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO EUMAEUS\\nAND PHILOETIUS\\n\\nMinerva now put it in Penelope\\'s mind to make the suitors try their\\nskill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,\\nas a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and\\ngot the store-room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of\\nivory; she then went with her maidens into the store-room at the end of\\nthe house, where her husband\\'s treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought\\niron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver full of\\ndeadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in\\nLacedaemon--Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with one another\\nin Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in\\norder to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the\\nMessenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had\\nsailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these\\nUlysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and\\nthe other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had\\ngone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost,\\nand the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were the\\ndeath of him in the end, for when he went to the house of Jove\\'s son,\\nmighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his\\nshame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven\\'s\\nvengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set before\\nIphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares\\nhimself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave\\nhim the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on\\nhis death had been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return\\na sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship,\\nalthough they never visited at one another\\'s houses, for Jove\\'s son\\nHercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him\\nby Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed for\\nTroy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it\\nbehind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.\\n\\nPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the\\ncarpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get\\nit quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the\\ndoors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the key,\\nand drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the doors;\\n{161} these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow,\\nand Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests stood in\\nwhich the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs:\\nreaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow case from the peg\\non which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as\\nshe took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved her,\\nshe went to the cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and\\nthe quiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along\\nwith her came her maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron\\nand bronze which her husband had won as prizes. When she reached the\\nsuitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of\\nthe cloister, holding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either\\nside of her. Then she said:\\n\\n\"Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of\\nthis house because its owner has been long absent, and without other\\npretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize that\\nyou are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and\\nwhomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through\\neach one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my\\nlawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But even so I\\ndoubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron\\nbefore the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had\\nbidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his master\\'s\\nbow, but Antinous scolded them. \"You country louts,\" said he, \"silly\\nsimpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying\\nin this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband;\\nsit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go outside if\\nyou want to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors shall have to\\ncontend for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light matter\\nto string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of us all who is\\nsuch another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember him, though I\\nwas then only a child.\"\\n\\nThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to\\nstring the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to\\nbe the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses,\\nwhom he was dishonouring in his own house--egging the others on to do so\\nalso.\\n\\nThen Telemachus spoke. \"Great heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"Jove must have\\nrobbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she\\nwill quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying\\nmyself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the\\ncontest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is for a woman whose\\npeer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca\\nnor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need have I to\\nspeak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses for delay,\\nbut let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too will make\\ntrial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I shall\\nnot suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can\\nwin the prizes which my father won before me.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him,\\nand took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in\\na long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by line.\\n{162} Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was\\nsurprised when they saw him set them up so orderly, though he had never\\nseen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on to the pavement\\nto make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his\\nmight to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had\\nhoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for\\nthe fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign to\\ncheck him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:\\n\\n\"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too\\nyoung, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able\\nto hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, who are\\nstronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.\"\\n\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led\\ninto the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then\\nhe sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said:\\n\\n\"Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place\\nat which the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.\"\\n\\nThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He\\nwas sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the\\nmixing-bowl. {163} He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and\\nwas indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow and\\narrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could not\\nstring the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work, they\\ntherefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, \"My friends, I\\ncannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take the life and\\nsoul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live\\nafter having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and\\nwhich has brought us so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping\\nand praying that he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow\\nand tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some other woman,\\nand let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it\\nis to win her.\"\\n\\nOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door, {164}\\nwith the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his\\nseat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him\\nsaying:\\n\\n\"Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and\\nintolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow\\ntake the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend\\nit yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are\\nothers who will soon string it.\"\\n\\nThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, \"Look sharp, light a fire in\\nthe court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also\\na large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us warm the\\nbow and grease it--we will then make trial of it again, and bring the\\ncontest to an end.\"\\n\\nMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside\\nit. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the\\nhouse, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but\\nthey were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless\\nthere still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders\\namong the suitors and much the foremost among them all.\\n\\nThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and\\nUlysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the outer\\nyard, Ulysses said to them quietly:\\n\\n\"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in\\ndoubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of\\nmen would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back\\nhere all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do--to side with the\\nsuitors, or with Ulysses?\"\\n\\n\"Father Jove,\" answered the stockman, \"would indeed that you might so\\nordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see\\nwith what might and main I would fight for him.\"\\n\\nIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return;\\nwhen, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses\\nsaid, \"It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last,\\nin the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find that you\\ntwo alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for I\\nhave not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two,\\ntherefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall\\ndeliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you,\\nwill give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me\\nas though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give\\nyou convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is\\nthe scar from the boar\\'s tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on\\nMt. Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they\\nhad examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw\\ntheir arms round him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses\\nkissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down\\nupon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:\\n\\n\"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and\\ntell those who are within. When you go in, do so separately, not both\\ntogether; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; let this\\nmoreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to\\nprevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you, therefore,\\nEumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and\\ntell the women to close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any\\ngroaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not\\ncome out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work.\\nAnd I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer court,\\nand to bind them securely at once.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat\\nthat he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.\\n\\nAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming\\nit by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly\\ngrieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I grieve for myself and for us\\nall; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care\\nnearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca\\nand elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so inferior to\\nUlysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This will disgrace us\\nin the eyes of those who are yet unborn.\"\\n\\n\"It shall not be so, Eurymachus,\" said Antinous, \"and you know it\\nyourself. Today is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can\\nstring a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side--as for the axes\\nthey can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the house\\nand take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that we\\nmay make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will\\ntell Melanthius to bring us in some goats tomorrow--the best he has; we\\ncan then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make\\ntrial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end.\"\\n\\nThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over\\nthe hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine\\nand water and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering.\\nThen, when they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as\\nhe desired, Ulysses craftily said:--\\n\\n\"Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am\\nminded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who\\nhas just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and\\nleave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory\\nto whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that I may\\nprove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have\\nas much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and neglect have\\nmade an end of it.\"\\n\\nThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,\\nAntinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, \"Wretched creature, you\\nhave not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought\\nto think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your\\nbetters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others\\nhave had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other beggar\\nor stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the\\nwine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those who\\ndrink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when\\nhe was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine had\\ngot into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of\\nPeirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they\\nrushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him\\nthrough the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore\\nthe burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore,\\nthere was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon\\nhimself through his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that\\nit will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy\\nfrom any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus,\\nwho kills every one that comes near him: you will never get away alive,\\nso drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger\\nthan yourself.\"\\n\\nPenelope then spoke to him. \"Antinous,\" said she, \"it is not right that\\nyou should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house.\\nIf the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of\\nUlysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make me\\nhis wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind:\\nnone of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all\\nreason.\"\\n\\n\"Queen Penelope,\" answered Eurymachus, \"we do not suppose that this man\\nwill take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest\\nsome of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go\\ngossiping about and say, \\'These suitors are a feeble folk; they are\\npaying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was\\nable to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it\\nat once and sent an arrow through the iron.\\' This is what will be said,\\nand it will be a scandal against us.\"\\n\\n\"Eurymachus,\" Penelope answered, \"people who persist in eating up the\\nestate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect\\nothers to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as\\nyou think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says\\nmoreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see\\nwhether he can string it or no. I say--and it shall surely be--that if\\nApollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a cloak\\nand shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and robbers,\\nand a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent\\nsafely wherever he wants to go.\"\\n\\nThen Telemachus said, \"Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in\\nthe islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any\\none have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the\\nother, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the\\nbow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the\\nhouse and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff,\\nand the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man\\'s matter, and mine\\nabove all others, for it is I who am master here.\"\\n\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\\'s saying in her\\nheart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned\\nher dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.\\n\\nThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses, but\\nthe suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of\\nthem said, \"You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of\\nyour wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own\\nboarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place, and worry you to\\ndeath.\"\\n\\nEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow\\ndown then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other\\nside of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, \"Father Eumaeus,\\nbring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with\\nstones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two. I wish\\nI was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as I am\\nthan you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry, for they\\nmean mischief.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them\\nin a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on and\\nplaced it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called\\nEuryclea apart and said to her, \"Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to\\nclose the doors of the women\\'s apartments. If they hear any groaning or\\nuproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out, but\\nare to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work.\"\\n\\nEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women\\'s\\napartments.\\n\\nMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of\\nthe outer court. There was a ship\\'s cable of byblus fibre lying in the\\ngatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again,\\nresuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who\\nhad now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about,\\nand proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into\\nits two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his\\nneighbour saying, \"This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has\\ngot one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike\\nstyle does the old vagabond handle it.\"\\n\\nAnother said, \"I hope he may be no more successful in other things than\\nhe is likely to be in stringing this bow.\"\\n\\nBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it\\nas easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes\\nthe twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand\\nto prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the\\ntwittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour\\nas they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a\\nsign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the\\nson of scheming Saturn had sent him.\\n\\nHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table {165}--for those\\nwhich the Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the\\nquiver--he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of\\nthe arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When\\nhe had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the\\nhandle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right\\nthrough them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:\\n\\n\"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I\\naimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and\\nnot as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for\\nthe Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and\\nthen otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the\\ncrowning ornaments of a banquet.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on\\nhis sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father\\'s seat.',\n",
       " 'BOOK VII\\n\\n  Hector and Ajax fight--Hector is getting worsted when night\\n  comes on and parts them--They exchange presents--The\\n  burial of the dead, and the building of a wall round their\\n  ships by the Achaeans--The Achaeans buy their wine of\\n  Agamemnon and Menelaus.\\n\\nWITH these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother\\nAlexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends a\\nbreeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have\\nlaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so welcome\\nwas the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.\\n\\nThereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he lived in\\nArne, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of Phylomedusa. Hector\\nthrew a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in the neck\\nunder the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaucus, moreover, son of\\nHippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight smote\\nIphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as he was springing on to his\\nchariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell to earth from the car, and\\nthere was no life left in him.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the Argives, she\\ndarted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, and Apollo, who was\\nlooking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he wanted the\\nTrojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and King Apollo\\nson of Jove was first to speak. \"What would you have,\" said he,\\n\"daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hither\\nfrom Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline\\nthe scales of victory in favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade\\nyou--for it will be better thus--stay the combat for to-day, but let\\nthem renew the fight hereafter till they compass the doom of Ilius,\\nsince you goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva answered, \"So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind that I\\ncame down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me, then, how\\ndo you propose to end this present fighting?\"\\n\\nApollo, son of Jove, replied, \"Let us incite great Hector to challenge\\nsome one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the Achaeans will be\\nshamed into finding a man who will fight him.\"\\n\\nMinerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of the\\ngods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, \"Hector son of Priam,\\npeer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then persuade you.\\nBid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats, and\\nchallenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you in single combat.\\nI have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour of your\\ndoom is not yet come.\"\\n\\nHector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the\\nTrojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and they\\nall sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But Minerva\\nand Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father Jove\\'s high\\noak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together,\\nbristling with shield and helmet and spear. As when the rising west\\nwind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow dark beneath it, so\\nsat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector\\nspoke thus:--\\n\\n\"Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded;\\nJove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to nothing,\\nand foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers of\\nTroy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The princes of the\\nAchaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him, then, that will\\nfight me stand forward as your champion against Hector. Thus I say, and\\nmay Jove be witness between us. If your champion slay me, let him strip\\nme of my armour and take it to your ships, but let him send my body\\nhome that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when\\nI am dead. In like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe me glory and I slay your\\nchampion, I will strip him of his armour and take it to the city of\\nIlius, where I will hang it in the temple of Apollo, but I will give up\\nhis body, that the Achaeans may bury him at their ships, and the build\\nhim a mound by the wide waters of the Hellespont. Then will one say\\nhereafter as he sails his ship over the sea, \\'This is the monument of\\none who died long since a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.\\'\\nThus will one say, and my fame shall not be lost.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline\\nthe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus rose and\\nrebuked them, for he was angry. \"Alas,\" he cried, \"vain braggarts,\\nwomen forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon us if\\nno man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned every man\\nof you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in\\nyour places. I will myself go out against this man, but the upshot of\\nthe fight will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your life\\nwould have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for he was\\nfar better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung upon you\\nand checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand and said,\\n\"Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient in spite of\\npassion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger than yourself\\nas Hector son of Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you.\\nEven Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are, shrank from\\nmeeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the Achaeans will\\nsend some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and fond of battle\\nthough he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under him if he comes\\nout alive from the hurly-burly of this fight.\"\\n\\nWith these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,\\nwhereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders.\\nThen Nestor rose and spoke, \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"the Achaean land is\\nfallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and orator\\namong the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to question me\\nconcerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How would it not\\ngrieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before Hector? Many a\\ntime would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave his\\nbody and go down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove,\\nMinerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the\\nPylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon\\nunder the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river\\nIardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their champion,\\nwith the armour of King Areithous upon his shoulders--Areithous whom\\nmen and women had surnamed \\'the Mace-man,\\' because he fought neither\\nwith bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron\\nmace. Lycurgus killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in\\na narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was\\ntoo quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell to\\nearth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which Mars\\nhad given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when he grew\\nold and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire Ereuthalion,\\nwho in this same armour challenged the foremost men among us. The\\nothers quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade me fight him though\\nnone other would venture; I was the youngest man of them all; but when\\nI fought him Minerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the biggest and\\nstrongest man that ever I killed, and covered much ground as he lay\\nsprawling upon the earth. Would that I were still young and strong as I\\nthen was, for the son of Priam would then soon find one who would face\\nhim. But you, foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of\\nyou any stomach for fighting Hector.\"\\n\\nThus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started to\\ntheir feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him brave\\nDiomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in\\nvalour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his brother\\nin arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of\\nAndraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor knight of Gerene again\\nspoke, saying: \"Cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. If he\\ncome alive out of this fight he will have done good service alike to\\nhis own soul and to the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrown\\nit into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people lifted their\\nhands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into the\\nvault of heaven, \"Father Jove, grant that the lot fall on Ajax, or on\\nthe son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene himself.\"\\n\\nAs they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and\\nfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted--the lot of Ajax. The\\nherald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the\\nAchaeans, going from left to right; but they none of them owned it.\\nWhen, however, in due course he reached the man who had written upon it\\nand had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and the\\nherald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw his mark he knew it and was\\nglad; he threw it to the ground and said, \"My friends, the lot is mine,\\nand I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my armour;\\nmeanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves that the\\nTrojans may not hear you--or aloud if you will, for we fear no man.\\nNone shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I was born\\nand bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.\"\\n\\nWith this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus\\nwould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, \"Father\\nJove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory to\\nAjax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector also\\nand would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess.\"\\n\\nThus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming\\nbronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Mars\\nwhen he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with one\\nanother--even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring forward\\nwith a grim smile on his face as he brandished his long spear and\\nstrode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but the\\nTrojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector beat\\nquickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks\\nbehind him, for he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his\\nshield in front of him like a wall--a shield of bronze with seven folds\\nof oxhide--the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the\\nbest worker in leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full-fed\\nbulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding\\nthis shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector,\\nand menaced him saying, \"Hector, you shall now learn, man to man, what\\nkind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted\\nAchilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in\\nanger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of us\\nwho are well able to face you; therefore begin the fight.\"\\n\\nAnd Hector answered, \"Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the host,\\ntreat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot fight.\\nI have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. I am quick\\nto turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this I deem the\\nmain thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots and horsemen, and\\nin hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Mars; howbeit I would\\nnot take such a man as you are off his guard--but I will smite you\\nopenly if I can.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck the\\nsevenfold shield in its outermost layer--the eighth, which was of\\nbronze--and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide it\\nstayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield of the\\nson of Priam. The terrible spear went through his gleaming shield, and\\npressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced\\nthe shirt against his side, but he swerved and thus saved his life.\\nThey then each of them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on\\none another like savage lions or wild boars of great strength and\\nendurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax\\'s shield, but the\\nbronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned. Ajax then\\nsprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear went through\\nit and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack; it gashed\\nhis neck and the blood came pouring from the wound, but even so Hector\\ndid not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with his brawny hand seized\\na stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the plain; with this he\\nstruck the shield of Ajax on the boss that was in its middle, so that\\nthe bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone,\\nswung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of\\na rock broke Hector\\'s shield inwards and threw him down on his back\\nwith the shield crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once.\\nThereon they would have hacked at one another in close combat with\\ntheir swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come\\nforward, one from the Trojans and the other from the\\nAchaeans--Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable men; these\\nparted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said, \"My\\nsons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both are dear\\nto Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the behests of\\nnight may not be well gainsaid.\"\\n\\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \"Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was he\\nthat challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will accept his\\nsaying.\"\\n\\nThen Hector said, \"Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and\\nstrength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all others\\nof the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will\\nfight anew till heaven decide between us, and give victory to one or to\\nthe other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not be\\nwell gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your ships,\\nand more especially those of your own followers and clansmen, while I,\\nin the great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their\\nwomen, who vie with one another in their prayers on my behalf. Let us,\\nmoreover, exchange presents that it may be said among the Achaeans and\\nTrojans, \\'They fought with might and main, but were reconciled and\\nparted in friendship.\\'\"\\n\\nOn this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and\\nleathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with\\npurple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans,\\nand the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their\\nhero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty\\nAjax. They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had been saved\\nbeyond their hopes. On the other side the Achaeans brought Ajax elated\\nwith victory to Agamemnon.\\n\\nWhen they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon\\nsacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son of\\nSaturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into\\njoints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them\\non the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off.\\nWhen they had done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it,\\nand every man had his full and equal share, so that all were satisfied,\\nand King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin,\\nas a mark of special honour. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\\ndrink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak; with\\nall sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:--\\n\\n\"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the Achaeans\\nare now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the Scamander,\\nand their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it will be well\\nwhen morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheel\\nour dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from the\\nships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades\\nhome to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow\\nthat shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let us\\nset about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships, and\\nlet it have well-made gates that there may be a way through them for\\nour chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round it to\\nkeep off both horse and foot, that the Trojan chieftains may not bear\\nhard upon us.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the\\nTrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis by\\nthe gates of King Priam\\'s palace; and wise Antenor spoke. \"Hear me,\" he\\nsaid, \"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as I am\\nminded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons of\\nAtreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn covenants,\\nand shall not prosper till we have done as I say.\"\\n\\nHe then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to speak.\\n\"Antenor,\" said he, \"your words are not to my liking; you can find a\\nbetter saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken in\\ngood earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason. I will\\nspeak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that I will not give up\\nthe woman; but the wealth that I brought home with her from Argos I\\nwill restore, and will add yet further of my own.\"\\n\\nOn this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race of\\nDardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity and\\ngoodwill addressed them thus: \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and\\nallies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now as\\nhitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful. At\\ndaybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus\\nsons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has\\ncome about; and let him also be instant with them that they now cease\\nfighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till\\nheaven decide between us and give victory to one or to the other.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took supper\\nin their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his way to the ships. He\\nfound the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of\\nAgamemnon\\'s ship, and took his place in the midst of them. \"Son of\\nAtreus,\" he said, \"and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the other\\nnoble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus through\\nwhom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find it\\nacceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships to\\nTroy--would that he had sooner perished--he will restore, and will add\\nyet further of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife of\\nMenelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me\\ninquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn our dead;\\nhereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give\\nvictory to one or to the other.\"\\n\\nThey all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud war-cry\\nspoke, saying, \"Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet\\nHelen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at\\nhand.\"\\n\\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed had\\nspoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, \"Idaeus, you have\\nheard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as\\nconcerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are\\nonce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Jove\\nthe mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, and\\nIdaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and\\nDardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he came,\\nhe stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon as they\\nheard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gather the\\ncorpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on their part also\\nhastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and others to\\nbring in wood.\\n\\nThe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into the\\nvault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when the\\ntwo armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they washed\\nthe clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and lifted them\\nupon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail aloud, so\\nthey heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having\\nburned them went back to the city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner\\nheaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned\\nthem went back to their ships.\\n\\nNow in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the\\nAchaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was\\nraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall to\\nshelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that\\nthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and close outside\\nit they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with\\nstakes.\\n\\nThus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove\\nthe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune, lord\\nof the earthquake, spoke, saying, \"Father Jove, what mortal in the\\nwhole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you not how\\nthe Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a trench\\nall round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The fame of this\\nwall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no longer think\\nanything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much\\nlabour for Laomedon.\"\\n\\nJove was displeased and answered, \"What, O shaker of the earth, are you\\ntalking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed at\\nwhat they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself.\\nSurely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships, you can\\nshatter their wall and fling it into the sea; you can cover the beach\\nwith sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be\\nutterly effaced.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was\\ncompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their\\nsupper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus the\\nson of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted them\\nwith ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to the sons\\nof Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the Achaeans bought\\ntheir wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some\\nwith whole heifers, and some again with captives. They spread a goodly\\nbanquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did the Trojans\\nand their allies in the city. But all the time Jove boded them ill and\\nroared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold upon them, and\\nthey spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground, nor did any\\ndare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty son of Saturn.\\nThen they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.']"

       "['Book I\\n\\nTHE GODS IN COUNCIL--MINERVA\\'S VISIT TO ITHACA--THE CHALLENGE FROM\\nTELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.\\n\\nTell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after\\nhe had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and\\nmany were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted;\\nmoreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and\\nbring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his\\nmen, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the\\ncattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever\\nreaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh daughter of\\nJove, from whatsoever source you may know them.\\n\\nSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely\\nhome except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife\\nand country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into\\na large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a\\ntime when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then,\\nhowever, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not\\nyet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except\\nNeptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him\\nget home.\\n\\nNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world\\'s end,\\nand lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East. {1} He\\nhad gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying\\nhimself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian\\nJove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment he was\\nthinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon\\'s son Orestes;\\nso he said to the other gods:\\n\\n\"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing\\nbut their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to\\nAgamemnon\\'s wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew\\nit would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do\\neither of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his\\nrevenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him\\nthis in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for\\neverything in full.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served\\nAegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but\\nAegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart\\nbleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,\\nfar away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered\\nwith forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,\\ndaughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean,\\nand carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. This\\ndaughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying\\nby every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he\\nis tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the\\nsmoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when\\nUlysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt\\nsacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?\"\\n\\nAnd Jove said, \"My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget\\nUlysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more\\nliberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear\\nin mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having\\nblinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to\\nNeptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore\\nthough he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing\\nhim from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together and see how\\nwe can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are\\nall of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva said, \"Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the\\ngods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury\\nto the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and\\nthat he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart\\ninto Ulysses\\' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans\\nin assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who\\npersist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also\\nconduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear anything about\\nthe return of his dear father--for this will make people speak well of\\nhim.\"\\n\\nSo saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,\\nwith which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the\\nredoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith\\nshe quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she\\ndarted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith she was\\nin Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses\\' house, disguised as a visitor,\\nMentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand.\\nThere she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which\\nthey had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house.\\nMen-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon them, some\\nmixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the\\ntables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting up\\ngreat quantities of meat.\\n\\nTelemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily\\namong the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would send\\nthem flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again and\\nbe honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he\\ncaught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed\\nthat a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right\\nhand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. \"Welcome,\" said he,\\n\"to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what\\nyou have come for.\"\\n\\nHe led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were\\nwithin he took her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong\\nbearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and\\nhe conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a\\ncloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,{2} and he set\\nanother seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might\\nnot be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he\\nmight ask her more freely about his father.\\n\\nA maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and\\npoured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she\\ndrew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and\\noffered them many good things of what there was in the house, the carver\\nfetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their\\nside, and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for them.\\n\\nThen the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats.\\n{3} Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went\\nround with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine\\nand water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were\\nbefore them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted\\nmusic and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet,\\nso a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce\\nto sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing\\nTelemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man\\nmight hear.\\n\\n\"I hope, sir,\" said he, \"that you will not be offended with what I am\\ngoing to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and\\nall this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some\\nwilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see\\nmy father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather\\nthan a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has\\nfallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is\\ncoming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now,\\nsir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell\\nme of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your\\ncrew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves\\nto be--for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want\\nto know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my\\nfather\\'s time? In the old days we had many visitors for my father went\\nabout much himself.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva answered, \"I will tell you truly and particularly all about\\nit. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have\\ncome here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue\\nbeing bound for Temesa {4} with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back\\ncopper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away\\nfrom the town, in the harbour Rheithron {5} under the wooded mountain\\nNeritum. {6} Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will\\ntell you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never\\ncomes to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly,\\nwith an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when\\nhe comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your\\nfather was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the gods\\nare still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the mainland.\\nIt is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a\\nprisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no\\nprophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne\\nin upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much\\nlonger; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were in\\nchains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But tell\\nme, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow\\nfor a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes,\\nfor we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower\\nof all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us\\nseen the other.\"\\n\\n\"My mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it\\nis a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one\\nwho had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there\\nis no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my\\nfather.\"\\n\\nAnd Minerva said, \"There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while\\nPenelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true,\\nwhat is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What\\nis it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the\\nfamily--for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And\\nthe guests--how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over\\nthe whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who\\ncomes near them.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Telemachus, \"as regards your question, so long as my father\\nwas here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their\\ndispleasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more\\nclosely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it\\nbetter even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before\\nTroy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting\\nwere done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his\\nashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the\\nstorm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone\\nwithout leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing\\nbut dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of\\nmy father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the\\nchiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of\\nZacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up\\nmy house under the pretext of paying their court to my mother, who\\nwill neither point blank say that she will not marry, {7} nor yet bring\\nmatters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before\\nlong will do so also with myself.\"\\n\\n\"Is that so?\" exclaimed Minerva, \"then you do indeed want Ulysses home\\nagain. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he is\\nthe man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making\\nmerry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were\\nhe to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming from\\nEphyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of\\nMermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any,\\nbut my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him. If Ulysses\\nis the man he then was these suitors will have a short shrift and a\\nsorry wedding.\\n\\n\"But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,\\nand take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you\\nto set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice,\\ncall the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning--lay your case\\nbefore them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take\\nthemselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother\\'s mind is set\\non marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her\\na husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a\\ndaughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take\\nthe best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest\\nof your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell\\nyou something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some\\nheaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor;\\nthence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all\\nthe Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way home,\\nyou can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another\\ntwelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come home at\\nonce, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow\\nto his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having done all\\nthis, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul, you\\nmay kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead\\ninfancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes\\'\\npraises for having killed his father\\'s murderer Aegisthus? You are a\\nfine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a\\nname in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew,\\nwho will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matter\\nover for yourself, and remember what I have said to you.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" answered Telemachus, \"it has been very kind of you to talk to me\\nin this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell\\nme; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little\\nlonger till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then\\ngive you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will give\\nyou one of great beauty and value--a keepsake such as only dear friends\\ngive to one another.\"\\n\\nMinerva answered, \"Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at\\nonce. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till\\nI come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very\\ngood one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.\"\\n\\nWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had\\ngiven Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about\\nhis father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the\\nstranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were\\nsitting.\\n\\nPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he\\ntold the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid\\nupon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from\\nher room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but\\nattended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood\\nby one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters {8}\\nwith a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a veil, moreover,\\nbefore her face, and was weeping bitterly.\\n\\n\"Phemius,\" she cried, \"you know many another feat of gods and heroes,\\nsuch as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and\\nlet them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it\\nbreaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I\\nmourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas and\\nmiddle Argos.\" {9}\\n\\n\"Mother,\" answered Telemachus, \"let the bard sing what he has a mind to;\\nbards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes\\nthem, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good\\npleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of\\nthe Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly.\\nMake up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only man who\\nnever came back from Troy, but many another went down as well as he. Go,\\nthen, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your\\nloom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is\\nman\\'s matter, and mine above all others {10}--for it is I who am master\\nhere.\"\\n\\nShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son\\'s saying in\\nher heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she\\nmourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.\\nBut the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters {11},\\nand prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.\\n\\nThen Telemachus spoke, \"Shameless,\" he cried, \"and insolent suitors, let\\nus feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a\\nrare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in\\nthe morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal notice\\nto depart, and feast at one another\\'s houses, turn and turn about, at\\nyour own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in spunging\\nupon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full,\\nand when you fall in my father\\'s house there shall be no man to avenge\\nyou.\"\\n\\nThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the\\nboldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, \"The\\ngods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may\\nJove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before\\nyou.\"\\n\\nTelemachus answered, \"Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing,\\nI will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of\\nfor me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches\\nand honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in\\nIthaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them;\\nnevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom\\nUlysses has won for me.\"\\n\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, \"It rests with heaven to\\ndecide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your\\nown house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man\\nin Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow,\\nI want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from?\\nOf what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news\\nabout the return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He\\nseemed a well to do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone\\nin a moment before we could get to know him.\"\\n\\n\"My father is dead and gone,\" answered Telemachus, \"and even if some\\nrumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed\\nsometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his\\nprophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of\\nAnchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father\\'s.\" But in\\nhis heart he knew that it had been the goddess.\\n\\nThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the\\nevening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to\\nbed each in his own abode. {12} Telemachus\\'s room was high up in a tower\\n{13} that looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding\\nand full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops,\\nthe son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches.\\nLaertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he\\ngave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her\\nin his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take\\nher to his bed for he feared his wife\\'s resentment. {14} She it was who\\nnow lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of\\nthe other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a\\nbaby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as\\nhe took off his shirt {15} he gave it to the good old woman, who folded\\nit tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after\\nwhich she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the\\nbolt home by means of the strap. {16} But Telemachus as he lay covered\\nwith a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended\\nvoyage and of the counsel that Minerva had given him.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XVIII\\n\\n  The grief of Achilles over Patroclus--The visit of Thetis\\n  to Vulcan and the armour that he made for Achilles.\\n\\nTHUS then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the fleet\\nrunner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached Achilles,\\nand found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that which was\\nindeed too surely true. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of\\nhis heart, \"why are the Achaeans again scouring the plain and flocking\\ntowards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not now bringing that\\nsorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, saying that while I was\\nyet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fall before the Trojans,\\nand see the light of the sun no longer. I fear the brave son of\\nMenoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet I bade him return\\nto the ships as soon as he had driven back those that were bringing\\nfire against them, and not join battle with Hector.\"\\n\\nAs he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and told his\\nsad tale, weeping bitterly the while. \"Alas,\" he cried, \"son of noble\\nPeleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that they were untrue.\\nPatroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about his naked body--for\\nHector holds his armour.\"\\n\\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filled both\\nhands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,\\ndisfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over his\\nshirt so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely at\\nfull length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom\\nAchilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,\\nbeating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.\\nAntilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his hands\\nas he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into his\\nown throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard him as\\nshe was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father,\\nwhereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus that\\ndwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There were\\nGlauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, Thoe and dark-eyed Halie,\\nCymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe and Agave, Doto\\nand Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and Callianeira,\\nDoris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes, Apseudes and\\nCallianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeira and Ianassa, Maera,\\nOreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids who\\ndwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was filled with their\\nmultitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them in\\ntheir lament.\\n\\n\"Listen,\" she cried, \"sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may hear\\nthe burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I have borne the\\nmost glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, hero among\\nheroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plant in a\\ngoodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight the\\nTrojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So\\nlong as he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is in heaviness,\\nand though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I will go, that\\nI may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallen him though he\\nis still holding aloof from battle.\"\\n\\nShe left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping\\nafter, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached the\\nrich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line on to\\nthe sands, at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons were drawn up\\nin close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother went up to him\\nas he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and spoke\\npiteously, saying, \"My son, why are you thus weeping? What sorrow has\\nnow befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jove has granted\\nyou the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands and besought\\nhim that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up at their ships, and\\nrue it bitterly in that you were no longer with them.\"\\n\\nAchilles groaned and answered, \"Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed\\nvouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me,\\nseeing that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen--he whom I valued more\\nthan all others, and loved as dearly as my own life? I have lost him;\\naye, and Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrous armour, so\\nglorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when they laid you in\\nthe couch of a mortal man. Would that you were still dwelling among the\\nimmortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken to himself some mortal\\nbride. For now you shall have grief infinite by reason of the death of\\nthat son whom you can never welcome home--nay, I will not live nor go\\nabout among mankind unless Hector fall by my spear, and thus pay me for\\nhaving slain Patroclus son of Menoetius.\"\\n\\nThetis wept and answered, \"Then, my son, is your end near at hand--for\\nyour own death awaits you full soon after that of Hector.\"\\n\\nThen said Achilles in his great grief, \"I would die here and now, in\\nthat I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home, and in\\nhis hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is there for\\nme? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought no saving\\nneither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so many have been\\nslain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootless burden upon\\nthe earth, I, who in fight have no peer among the Achaeans, though in\\ncouncil there are better than I. Therefore, perish strife both from\\namong gods and men, and anger, wherein even a righteous man will harden\\nhis heart--which rises up in the soul of a man like smoke, and the\\ntaste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey. Even so has Agamemnon\\nangered me. And yet--so be it, for it is over; I will force my soul\\ninto subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will pursue Hector who\\nhas slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will then abide my doom when\\nit may please Jove and the other gods to send it. Even Hercules, the\\nbest beloved of Jove--even he could not escape the hand of death, but\\nfate and Juno\\'s fierce anger laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am\\ndead if a like doom awaits me. Till then I will win fame, and will bid\\nTrojan and Dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with\\nboth their hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall\\nthey know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer.\\nHold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you shall not\\nmove me.\"\\n\\nThen silver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, what you have said is\\ntrue. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but your\\narmour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph upon\\nhis own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not be\\nlasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the press\\nof battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break of day I\\nshall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from King Vulcan.\"\\n\\nOn this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to the\\nsea-nymphs her sisters, \"Dive into the bosom of the sea and go to the\\nhouse of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as for me, I\\nwill go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and ask him to\\nprovide my son with a suit of splendid armour.\"\\n\\nWhen she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves, while\\nsilver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the armour for\\nher son.\\n\\nThus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and meanwhile the\\nAchaeans were flying with loud cries before murderous Hector till they\\nreached the ships and the Hellespont, and they could not draw the body\\nof Mars\\'s servant Patroclus out of reach of the weapons that were\\nshowered upon him, for Hector son of Priam with his host and horsemen\\nhad again caught up to him like the flame of a fiery furnace; thrice\\ndid brave Hector seize him by the feet, striving with might and main to\\ndraw him away and calling loudly on the Trojans, and thrice did the two\\nAjaxes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him from off the\\nbody; but all undaunted he would now charge into the thick of the\\nfight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud, but he would\\ngive no ground. As upland shepherds that cannot chase some famished\\nlion from a carcase, even so could not the two Ajaxes scare Hector son\\nof Priam from the body of Patroclus.\\n\\nAnd now he would even have dragged it off and have won imperishable\\nglory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her way as messenger from\\nOlympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. She came secretly\\nwithout the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, for Juno sent her,\\nand when she had got close to him she said, \"Up, son of Peleus,\\nmightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom this fearful\\nfight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another, the\\nDanaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans are trying to\\nhale it away, and take it to windy Ilius: Hector is the most furious of\\nthem all; he is for cutting the head from the body and fixing it on the\\nstakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink from the\\nthought that Patroclus may become meat for the dogs of Troy. Shame on\\nyou, should his body suffer any kind of outrage.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles said, \"Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you to me?\"\\n\\nIris answered, \"It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son of\\nSaturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of the\\nimmortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus.\"\\n\\nThen fleet Achilles answered her saying, \"How can I go up into the\\nbattle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I should\\nsee her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from Vulcan; I\\nknow no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of Ajax son\\nof Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front rank and\\nwielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus.\"\\n\\nIris said, \"We know that your armour has been taken, but go as you are;\\ngo to the deep trench and show yourself before the Trojans, that they\\nmay fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons of the\\nAchaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle may hardly be.\"\\n\\nIris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove arose,\\nand Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong shoulders; she\\ncrowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which she kindled a\\nglow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into heaven from some\\ncity that is being beleaguered on an island far out at sea--all day\\nlong do men sally from the city and fight their hardest, and at the\\ngoing down of the sun the line of beacon-fires blazes forth, flaring\\nhigh for those that dwell near them to behold, if so be that they may\\ncome with their ships and succour them--even so did the light flare\\nfrom the head of Achilles, as he stood by the trench, going beyond the\\nwall--but he did not join the Achaeans for he heeded the charge which\\nhis mother laid upon him.\\n\\nThere did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice from\\nafar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing as the\\nnote of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the gates of a\\ncity, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus, and when the\\nTrojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the horses turned\\nback with their chariots for they boded mischief, and their drivers\\nwere awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyed goddess had\\nkindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.\\n\\nThrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench, and\\nthrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into confusion;\\nwhereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath the wheels of\\ntheir chariots and perished by their own spears. The Achaeans to their\\ngreat joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of the weapons, and laid him\\non a litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, and among them\\nfleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying dead\\nupon his bier. He had sent him out with horses and chariots into\\nbattle, but his return he was not to welcome.\\n\\nThen Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters of\\nOceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and turmoil\\nof war.\\n\\nNow the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked their\\nhorses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. They\\nkept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallen\\nupon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having held\\naloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first to\\nspeak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both before\\nand after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon the\\nsame night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed\\nthem thus:--\\n\\n\"Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to your\\ncity and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are far from\\nour walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnon the\\nAchaeans were easier to deal with, and I would have gladly camped by\\nthe ships in the hope of taking them; but now I go in great fear of the\\nfleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that he will never bide here on\\nthe plain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fight with equal valour, but\\nhe will try to storm our city and carry off our women. Do then as I\\nsay, and let us retreat. For this is what will happen. The darkness of\\nnight will for a time stay the son of Peleus, but if he find us here in\\nthe morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall have\\nknowledge of him in good earnest. Glad indeed will he be who can escape\\nand get back to Ilius, and many a Trojan will become meat for dogs and\\nvultures may I never live to hear it. If we do as I say, little though\\nwe may like it, we shall have strength in counsel during the night, and\\nthe great gates with the doors that close them will protect the city.\\nAt dawn we can arm and take our stand on the walls; he will then rue it\\nif he sallies from the ships to fight us. He will go back when he has\\ngiven his horses their fill of being driven all whithers under our\\nwalls, and will be in no mind to try and force his way into the city.\\nNeither will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so.\"\\n\\nHector looked fiercely at him and answered, \"Polydamas, your words are\\nnot to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within the\\ncity. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? In the\\nold-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over for its\\nwealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out of our\\nhouses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia,\\nfor the hand of Jove has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,\\nthat the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here and\\nto hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this fool\\'s\\nwise among the people. You will have no man with you; it shall not be;\\ndo all of you as I now say;--take your suppers in your companies\\nthroughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful every man of\\nyou. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let him gather them\\nand give them out among the people. Better let these, rather than the\\nAchaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm and fight about the ships;\\ngranted that Achilles has again come forward to defend them, let it be\\nas he will, but it shall go hard with him. I shall not shun him, but\\nwill fight him, to fall or conquer. The god of war deals out like\\nmeasure to all, and the slayer may yet be slain.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted in\\napplause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding.\\nThey gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words of\\nPolydamas no man would heed. They took their supper throughout the\\nhost, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mourned\\nPatroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid his\\nmurderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again and\\nagain as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed him\\nof his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he is\\nfurious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he can\\nfind him, for he is mad with rage--even so with many a sigh did\\nAchilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, \"Alas! vain were the words\\nwith which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said that I\\nwould bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked\\nIlius and taken his share of the spoils--but Jove does not give all men\\ntheir heart\\'s desire. The same soil shall be reddened here at Troy by\\nthe blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomed home by the old\\nknight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in this place shall\\nthe earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, now that I am left\\nbehind you, I will not bury you, till I have brought hither the head\\nand armour of mighty Hector who has slain you. Twelve noble sons of\\nTrojans will I behead before your bier to avenge you; till I have done\\nso you shall lie as you are by the ships, and fair women of Troy and\\nDardanus, whom we have taken with spear and strength of arm when we\\nsacked men\\'s goodly cities, shall weep over you both night and day.\"\\n\\nThen Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire that\\nthey might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon they set a\\ntripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw sticks on to\\nit to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played about\\nthe belly of the tripod. When the water in the cauldron was boiling\\nthey washed the body, anointed it with oil, and closed its wounds with\\nointment that had been kept nine years. Then they laid it on a bier and\\ncovered it with a linen cloth from head to foot, and over this they\\nlaid a fair white robe. Thus all night long did the Myrmidons gather\\nround Achilles to mourn Patroclus.\\n\\nThen Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, \"So, Queen Juno, you have\\ngained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think that\\nthe Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.\"\\n\\nAnd Juno answered, \"Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this thing?\\nMay not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we do, do\\nwhat he can for another person? And shall not I--foremost of all\\ngoddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign in\\nheaven--devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of Vulcan,\\nimperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in heaven, a house\\nof bronze wrought by the lame god\\'s own hands. She found him busy with\\nhis bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making twenty\\ntripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, and he set wheels\\nof gold under them all that they might go of their own selves to the\\nassemblies of the gods, and come back again--marvels indeed to see.\\nThey were finished all but the ears of cunning workmanship which yet\\nremained to be fixed to them: these he was now fixing, and he was\\nhammering at the rivets. While he was thus at work silver-footed Thetis\\ncame to the house. Charis, of graceful head-dress, wife to the\\nfar-famed lame god, came towards her as soon as she saw her, and took\\nher hand in her own, saying, \"Why have you come to our house, Thetis,\\nhonoured and ever welcome--for you do not visit us often? Come inside\\nand let me set refreshment before you.\"\\n\\nThe goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a richly\\ndecorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under her\\nfeet. Then she called Vulcan and said, \"Vulcan, come here, Thetis wants\\nyou\"; and the far-famed lame god answered, \"Then it is indeed an august\\nand honoured goddess who has come here; she it was that took care of me\\nwhen I was suffering from the heavy fall which I had through my cruel\\nmother\\'s anger--for she would have got rid of me because I was lame. It\\nwould have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome, daughter of the\\never-encircling waters of Oceanus, and Thetis, taken me to their bosom.\\nNine years did I stay with them, and many beautiful works in bronze,\\nbrooches, spiral armlets, cups, and chains, did I make for them in\\ntheir cave, with the roaring waters of Oceanus foaming as they rushed\\never past it; and no one knew, neither of gods nor men, save only\\nThetis and Eurynome who took care of me. If, then, Thetis has come to\\nmy house I must make her due requital for having saved me; entertain\\nher, therefore, with all hospitality, while I put by my bellows and all\\nmy tools.\"\\n\\nOn this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legs\\nplying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, and\\ngathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge and\\nwashed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donned\\nhis shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door. There\\nwere golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like real young\\nwomen, with sense and reason, voice also and strength, and all the\\nlearning of the immortals; these busied themselves as the king bade\\nthem, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon a goodly seat, and\\ntook her hand in his own, saying, \"Why have you come to our house,\\nThetis honoured and ever welcome--for you do not visit us often? Say\\nwhat you want, and I will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can\\nbe done at all.\"\\n\\nThetis wept and answered, \"Vulcan, is there another goddess in Olympus\\nwhom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so much affliction\\nas he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did he make subject to a\\nmortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorely against my will did I\\nsubmit to the embraces of one who was but mortal, and who now stays at\\nhome worn out with age. Neither is this all. Heaven vouchsafed me a\\nson, hero among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling. I tended him as a\\nplant in a goodly garden and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight\\nthe Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus.\\nSo long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun, he is in\\nheaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him; King Agamemnon has\\nmade him give up the maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had awarded\\nhim, and he wastes with sorrow for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed\\nthe Achaeans in at their ships\\' sterns and would not let them come\\nforth; the elders, therefore, of the Argives besought Achilles and\\noffered him great treasure, whereon he refused to bring deliverance to\\nthem himself, but put his own armour on Patroclus and sent him into the\\nfight with much people after him. All day long they fought by the\\nScaean gates and would have taken the city there and then, had not\\nApollo vouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of\\nMenoetius after he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am\\nsuppliant at your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son,\\nwhose end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves\\nfitted with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own\\nwhen his true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now lies\\nstretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.\"\\n\\nAnd Vulcan answered, \"Take heart, and be no more disquieted about this\\nmatter; would that I could hide him from death\\'s sight when his hour is\\ncome, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze the eyes of\\nall who behold it.\"\\n\\nWhen he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning them\\ntowards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows blew\\nupon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some fierce\\nto help him when he had need of them, and others less strong as Vulcan\\nwilled it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper into the\\nfire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its\\nblock, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took the\\ntongs in the other.\\n\\nFirst he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over\\nand binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and the\\nbaldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five thicknesses, and\\nwith many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.\\n\\nHe wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her\\nfull and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face of\\nheaven--the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which men\\nalso call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing\\nOrion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus.\\n\\nHe wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of men.\\nIn the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were going about\\nthe city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight from their\\nchambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the youths danced to the\\nmusic of flute and lyre, while the women stood each at her house door\\nto see them.\\n\\nMeanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a\\nquarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man who\\nhad been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid\\ndamages in full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each was\\ntrying to make his own case good, and the people took sides, each man\\nbacking the side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them back, and\\nthe elders sate on their seats of stone in a solemn circle, holding the\\nstaves which the heralds had put into their hands. Then they rose and\\neach in his turn gave judgement, and there were two talents laid down,\\nto be given to him whose judgement should be deemed the fairest.\\n\\nAbout the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming armour,\\nand they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and accept the\\nhalf of what it contained. But the men of the city would not yet\\nconsent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives and little\\nchildren kept guard upon the walls, and with them were the men who were\\npast fighting through age; but the others sallied forth with Mars and\\nPallas Minerva at their head--both of them wrought in gold and clad in\\ngolden raiment, great and fair with their armour as befitting gods,\\nwhile they that followed were smaller. When they reached the place\\nwhere they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to which live\\nstock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here, then,\\nthey lay concealed, clad in full armour. Some way off them there were\\ntwo scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or cattle,\\nwhich presently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing on\\ntheir pipes, and had not so much as a thought of danger. When those who\\nwere in ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds and killed\\nthe shepherds. Meanwhile the besiegers, when they heard much noise\\namong the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses, and\\nmade with all speed towards them; when they reached them they set\\nbattle in array by the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed their\\nbronze-shod spears at one another. With them were Strife and Riot, and\\nfell Fate who was dragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound,\\nand the other unwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragging\\nhim along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men\\'s blood. They\\nwent in and out with one another and fought as though they were living\\npeople haling away one another\\'s dead.\\n\\nHe wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed already.\\nMany men were working at the plough within it, turning their oxen to\\nand fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on reaching\\nthe headland a man would come up to them and give them a cup of wine,\\nand they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the time\\nwhen they should again reach the headland. The part that they had\\nploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though it was of\\ngold, still looked as if it were being ploughed--very curious to behold.\\n\\nHe wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were reaping\\nwith sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to the\\nground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them in\\nbands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind them there\\nwere boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept on bringing\\nthem to be bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by in\\nsilence and was glad. The servants were getting a meal ready under an\\noak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting him up,\\nwhile the women were making a porridge of much white barley for the\\nlabourers\\' dinner.\\n\\nHe wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines were\\nloaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the vines were\\ntrained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal all round it,\\nand fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one path to it, and\\nby this the vintagers went when they would gather the vintage. Youths\\nand maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried the luscious fruit in\\nplaited baskets; and with them there went a boy who made sweet music\\nwith his lyre, and sang the Linos-song with his clear boyish voice.\\n\\nHe wrought also a herd of horned cattle. He made the cows of gold and\\ntin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go and\\nfeed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Along\\nwith the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, and\\ntheir nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had fastened\\non a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as he\\nmight they haled him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions tore\\nthrough the bull\\'s thick hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels,\\nbut the herdsmen were afraid to do anything, and only hounded on their\\ndogs; the dogs dared not fasten on the lions but stood by barking and\\nkeeping out of harm\\'s way.\\n\\nThe god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and a large\\nflock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.\\n\\nFurthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made in\\nCnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths and maidens whom\\nall would woo, with their hands on one another\\'s wrists. The maidens\\nwore robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that were\\nslightly oiled. The girls were crowned with garlands, while the young\\nmen had daggers of gold that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes they\\nwould dance deftly in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it were a\\npotter sitting at his work and making trial of his wheel to see whether\\nit will run, and sometimes they would go all in line with one another,\\nand much people was gathered joyously about the green. There was a bard\\nalso to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about\\nperforming in the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.\\n\\nAll round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream of\\nthe river Oceanus.\\n\\nThen when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made a\\nbreastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made a helmet, close\\nfitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume overhanging\\nit; and he made greaves also of beaten tin.\\n\\nLastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took it and\\nset it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like a falcon\\nfrom the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming armour\\nfrom the house of Vulcan.',\n",
       " 'Book V\\n\\nCALYPSO--ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.\\n\\nAnd now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus--harbinger of light\\nalike to mortals and immortals--the gods met in council and with them,\\nJove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to\\ntell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away\\nthere in the house of the nymph Calypso.\\n\\n\"Father Jove,\" said she, \"and all you other gods that live in\\neverlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and\\nwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. I hope\\nthey will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of\\nhis subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them as though he were\\ntheir father. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where dwells\\nthe nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get back to\\nhis own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take him\\nover the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to murder his\\nonly son Telemachus, who is coming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where\\nhe has been to see if he can get news of his father.\"\\n\\n\"What, my dear, are you talking about?\" replied her father, \"did you not\\nsend him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses to\\nget home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to\\nprotect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while the suitors\\nhave to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, \"Mercury, you are\\nour messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor\\nUlysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor men,\\nbut after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to reach\\nfertile Scheria, {50} the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to\\nthe gods, and will honour him as though he were one of ourselves. They\\nwill send him in a ship to his own country, and will give him more\\nbronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back from Troy,\\nif he had had all his prize money and had got home without disaster.\\nThis is how we have settled that he shall return to his country and his\\nfriends.\"\\n\\nThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as\\nhe was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with\\nwhich he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand\\nwith which he seals men\\'s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he\\npleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped\\ndown through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose\\nwaves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and\\ncorner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He\\nflew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the\\nisland which was his journey\\'s end, he left the sea and went on by land\\ntill he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.\\n\\nHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and\\none could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal\\nwood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden\\nshuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there\\nwas a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees,\\nwherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests--owls, hawks, and\\nchattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the waters. A vine\\nloaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of\\nthe cave; there were also four running rills of water in channels cut\\npretty close together, and turned hither and thither so as to irrigate\\nthe beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. {51}\\nEven a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot,\\nso Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it\\nsufficiently he went inside the cave.\\n\\nCalypso knew him at once--for the gods all know each other, no matter\\nhow far they live from one another--but Ulysses was not within; he was\\non the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears\\nin his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso\\ngave Mercury a seat and said: \"Why have you come to see me,\\nMercury--honoured, and ever welcome--for you do not visit me often? Say\\nwhat you want; I will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can be\\ndone at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed\\nhim some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough,\\nand then said:\\n\\n\"We are speaking god and goddess to one another, and you ask me why I\\nhave come here, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove\\nsent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all\\nthis way over the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer\\nme sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none\\nof us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says that\\nyou have here the most ill-starred of all those who fought nine years\\nbefore the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year after\\nhaving sacked it. On their way home they sinned against Minerva, {52}\\nwho raised both wind and waves against them, so that all his brave\\ncompanions perished, and he alone was carried hither by wind and tide.\\nJove says that you are to let this man go at once, for it is decreed\\nthat he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but shall return\\nto his house and country and see his friends again.\"\\n\\nCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, \"You gods,\" she\\nexclaimed, \"ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous\\nand hate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live with\\nhim in open matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion,\\nyou precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed him\\nin Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to\\nhim in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove came to hear of it before so\\nvery long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts. And now you are angry\\nwith me too because I have a man here. I found the poor creature sitting\\nall alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with lightning\\nand sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he\\nhimself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of him\\nand cherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal, so that\\nhe should never grow old all his days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor\\nbring his counsels to nothing; therefore, if he insists upon it, let the\\nman go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him anywhere myself\\nfor I have neither ships nor men who can take him. Nevertheless I will\\nreadily give him such advice, in all good faith, as will be likely to\\nbring him safely to his own country.\"\\n\\n\"Then send him away,\" said Mercury, \"or Jove will be angry with you and\\npunish you\".\\n\\nOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses, for\\nshe had heard Jove\\'s message. She found him sitting upon the beach with\\nhis eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness; for\\nhe had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced to sleep with her\\nin the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have it so. As for\\nthe day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore, weeping,\\ncrying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon the sea.\\nCalypso then went close up to him said:\\n\\n\"My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life\\nout any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will; so go,\\ncut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an upper\\ndeck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine,\\nand water on board to save you from starving. I will also give you\\nclothes, and will send you a fair wind to take you home, if the gods in\\nheaven so will it--for they know more about these things, and can settle\\nthem better than I can.\"\\n\\nUlysses shuddered as he heard her. \"Now goddess,\" he answered, \"there is\\nsomething behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me home\\nwhen you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not\\neven a well found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant\\nvoyage: nothing that you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft\\nunless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no mischief.\"\\n\\nCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: \"You know a great\\ndeal,\" said she, \"but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above and\\nearth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx--and this\\nis the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take--that I mean you\\nno sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactly what I should do\\nmyself in your place. I am dealing with you quite straightforwardly; my\\nheart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry for you.\"\\n\\nWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and Ulysses\\nfollowed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went on and on till\\nthey came to Calypso\\'s cave, where Ulysses took the seat that Mercury\\nhad just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of the food that\\nmortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself, and\\nthey laid their hands on the good things that were before them. When\\nthey had satisfied themselves with meat and drink, Calypso spoke,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to your own\\nland at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only know how much\\nsuffering is in store for you before you get back to your own country,\\nyou would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and let me\\nmake you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see this wife\\nof yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet I\\nflatter myself that I am no whit less tall or well-looking than she\\nis, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should compare in\\nbeauty with an immortal.\"\\n\\n\"Goddess,\" replied Ulysses, \"do not be angry with me about this. I\\nam quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so\\nbeautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an immortal.\\nNevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothing else. If some\\ngod wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and make the best\\nof it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea already, so let\\nthis go with the rest.\"\\n\\nPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into\\nthe inner part of the cave and went to bed.\\n\\nWhen the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on\\nhis shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer\\nfabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her\\nwaist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to think how\\nshe could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a great bronze\\naxe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and had a\\nbeautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave him a\\nsharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of the island where the\\nlargest trees grew--alder, poplar and pine, that reached the sky--very\\ndry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the water. {53}\\nThen, when she had shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went\\nhome, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished doing. He cut down\\ntwenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring them by rule in good\\nworkmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back with some augers, so\\nhe bored holes with them and fitted the timbers together with bolts and\\nrivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam\\nof a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a\\ngunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder\\nto steer with. He fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a\\nprotection against the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood.\\nBy and by Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made\\nthese too, excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of\\nall, with the help of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.\\n\\nIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso\\nsent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean\\nclothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another larger\\none of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and found\\nhim in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm for\\nhim, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it, while he sat and\\nguided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder. He never closed his\\neyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Bootes, and on\\nthe Bear--which men also call the wain, and which turns round and round\\nwhere it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into the stream of\\nOceanus--for Calypso had told him to keep this to his left. Days seven\\nand ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines\\nof the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared,\\nrising like a shield on the horizon.\\n\\nBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of\\nUlysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could see\\nhim sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his\\nhead and muttered to himself, saying, \"Good heavens, so the gods have\\nbeen changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in Ethiopia,\\nand now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed\\nthat he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Still,\\nhe shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with it.\"\\n\\nThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred\\nit round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till\\nearth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of\\nthe heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all\\nat the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Ulysses\\' heart\\nbegan to fail him. \"Alas,\" he said to himself in his dismay, \"what ever\\nwill become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she said I should\\nhave trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming true. How\\nblack is Jove making heaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds\\nare raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest\\nand thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause\\nof the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when the\\nTrojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for\\nthen I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured\\nmy name; but now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft\\nreeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go the\\nhelm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke the mast\\nhalf way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long\\ntime Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do to rise to the\\nsurface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him down;\\nbut at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter brine\\nthat was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this,\\nhowever, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he could\\ntowards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to escape\\ndrowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds\\nwhirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though the\\nSouth, North, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and\\nshuttlecock with it at once.\\n\\nWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also called\\nLeucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been\\nsince raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great\\ndistress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like\\na sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.\\n\\n\"My poor good man,\" said she, \"why is Neptune so furiously angry with\\nyou? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster\\nhe will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid\\nyou; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind, and swim to the\\nPhaeacian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take my veil and\\nput it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to no harm\\nso long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off, throw it\\nback as far as you can into the sea, and then go away again.\" With these\\nwords she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived down again\\nlike a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.\\n\\nBut Ulysses did not know what to think. \"Alas,\" he said to himself in\\nhis dismay, \"this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring me\\nto ruin by advising me to quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at\\npresent, for the land where she said I should be quit of all troubles\\nseemed to be still a good way off. I know what I will do--I am sure it\\nwill be best--no matter what happens I will stick to the raft as long\\nas her timbers hold together, but when the sea breaks her up I will swim\\nfor it; I do not see how I can do any better than this.\"\\n\\nWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that\\nseemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft,\\nwhich then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed\\nabout by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon\\nit as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso\\nhad given him, bound Ino\\'s veil under his arms, and plunged into the\\nsea--meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched him as he did so,\\nand wagged his head, muttering to himself and saying, \"There now, swim\\nup and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do people.\\nI do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too\\nlightly.\" On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his\\npalace is.\\n\\nBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of all the\\nwinds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good\\nstiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses\\nreached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.\\n\\nThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water, with\\na heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when the\\nthird day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much\\nas a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly\\nahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children rejoice when\\ntheir dear father begins to get better after having for a long time\\nborne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but the gods\\ndeliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankful when he again saw land\\nand trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might once more set\\nfoot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he began to\\nhear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still broke\\nagainst them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in spray;\\nthere were no harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind,\\nbut only headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.\\n\\nUlysses\\' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly to\\nhimself, \"Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I\\nhad given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for the coast is\\nrocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea,\\nwith deep water close under them so that I cannot climb out for want of\\nfoot hold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs and dash\\nme against the rocks as I leave the water--which would give me a\\nsorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of some\\nshelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me out to sea again\\nsorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster of the\\ndeep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that\\nNeptune is very angry with me.\"\\n\\nWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such\\nforce against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to\\npieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the\\nrock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till the wave\\nretired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wave came on again\\nand carried him back with it far into the sea--tearing his hands as the\\nsuckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks it from its bed, and\\nthe stones come up along with it--even so did the rocks tear the skin\\nfrom his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep down under the\\nwater.\\n\\nHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his own\\ndestiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him. He\\nswam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating against\\nthe land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the shore to\\nsee if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take the waves\\naslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a river, and\\nhere he thought would be the best place, for there were no rocks, and it\\nafforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a current, so he\\nprayed inwardly and said:\\n\\n\"Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the\\nsea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost\\nhis way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my\\ndistress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees of your\\nriverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself your\\nsuppliant.\"\\n\\nThen the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm\\nbefore him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here\\nat last Ulysses\\' knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had\\ncompletely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and\\nnostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither\\nbreathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,\\nwhen he had got his breath and came to himself again, he took off the\\nscarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt {54} stream\\nof the river, whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that\\nbore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among the\\nrushes, and kissed the bounteous earth.\\n\\n\"Alas,\" he cried to himself in his dismay, \"what ever will become of me,\\nand how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through the\\nlong watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and\\ndamp may make an end of me--for towards sunrise there will be a keen\\nwind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill\\nside, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may escape\\nthe cold and have a good night\\'s rest, but some savage beast may take\\nadvantage of me and devour me.\"\\n\\nIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he found one\\nupon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath\\ntwo shoots of olive that grew from a single stock--the one an ungrafted\\nsucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally,\\ncould break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun\\'s rays\\npierce them, nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow\\ninto one another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself\\na bed to lie on, for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying\\nabout--enough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard\\nwinter weather. He was glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down\\nand heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the\\ncountry, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the\\nashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did\\nUlysses cover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep\\nupon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose all memories of his\\nsorrows.',\n",
       " 'BOOK V\\n\\n  The exploits of Diomed, who, though wounded by Pandarus,\\n  continues fighting--He kills Pandarus and wounds AEneas--Venus\\n  rescues AEneas, but being wounded by Diomed, commits him\\n  to the care of Apollo and goes to Olympus, where she is tended\\n  by her mother Dione--Mars encourages the Trojans, and\\n  AEneas returns to the fight cured of his wound--Minerva and\\n  Juno help the Achaeans, and by the advice of the former\\n  Diomed wounds Mars, who returns to Olympus to get cured.\\n\\nThen Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus,\\nthat he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself with\\nglory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet like\\nthe star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in the\\nwaters of Oceanus--even such a fire did she kindle upon his head and\\nshoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of the\\nfight.\\n\\nNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,\\npriest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and\\nIdaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came\\nforward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being on\\nfoot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close up to\\none another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomed\\'s\\nleft shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear\\nsped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and\\nhe fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother\\'s\\nbody, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight, or he would have\\nshared his brother\\'s fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by wrapping him in\\na cloud of darkness, that his old father might not be utterly\\noverwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus drove off with the\\nhorses, and bade his followers take them to the ships. The Trojans were\\nscared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of them in fright and\\nthe other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by\\nthe hand and said, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of\\ncities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out,\\nand see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go\\naway, and thus avoid his anger.\"\\n\\nSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon the\\nsteep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the Trojans\\nback, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First King\\nAgamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his\\nchariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,\\njust as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders\\nand went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round\\nhim as he fell heavily to the ground.\\n\\nThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come\\nfrom Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as he\\nwas mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him as\\nhe fell heavily from the car.\\n\\nThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus, son\\nof Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman\\nand keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill\\nevery kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but\\nneither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for the\\nspear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it struck\\nhim between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he\\nfell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.\\n\\nMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son of\\nHermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning\\nworkmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that\\nmade the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all\\nmischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus\\nhimself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him\\nas he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The point of the\\nspear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came upon him\\nas he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.\\n\\nMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was a\\nbastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children, for\\nthe love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to him\\nand drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue\\nall among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead in the\\ndust.\\n\\nAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble\\nDolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was\\nhonoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him\\nchase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the\\narm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to\\nthe ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can\\nwithstand, came over his eyes.\\n\\nThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of\\nTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or the\\nTrojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has\\nburst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful\\nvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but\\nin a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that\\nmany a strong man\\'s hand has reclaimed--even so were the dense\\nphalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many\\nthough they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.\\n\\nNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving the\\nTrojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front part\\nof his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the\\nmetal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with\\nblood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, \"Knights Trojans,\\ncome on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold\\nout much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from\\nLycia hither.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew\\nand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.\\n\"Dear son of Capaneus,\" said he, \"come down from your chariot, and draw\\nthe arrow out of my shoulder.\"\\n\\nSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound,\\nwhereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been made\\nin his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, \"Hear me, daughter of\\naegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and\\nstood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me\\nto come within a spear\\'s throw of that man and kill him. He has been\\ntoo quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that I\\nshall not see the light of the sun much longer.\"\\n\\nThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple\\nand quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him and\\nsaid, \"Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I have set\\nin your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus. Moreover, I\\nhave withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men\\napart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not\\nfight him; but should Jove\\'s daughter Venus come, strike her with your\\nspear and wound her.\"\\n\\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again\\ntook his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce\\neven than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain\\nshepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall\\nof a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused the brute\\nto fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of\\nthe buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are\\nsmothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps\\nout over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed go furiously about\\namong the Trojans.\\n\\nHe killed Astynous, and Hypeiron shepherd of his people, the one with a\\nthrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with\\na sword-cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neck\\nand back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and\\nPolyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never came\\nback for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an\\nend of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of\\nPhaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with\\nage, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took\\nboth their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he\\nnevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided\\nhis wealth among themselves.\\n\\nThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they\\nwere both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on the\\nneck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For\\nall their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and\\nstripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses to his\\ncomrades to take them back to the ships.\\n\\nWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through\\nthe fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus.\\nWhen he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, \"Pandarus, where is\\nnow your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, in\\nrespect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in Lycia\\nthat can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an arrow at\\nthis fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done such deadly\\nwork among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man--unless indeed\\nhe is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices,\\nand and has set his hand against them in his displeasure.\"\\n\\nAnd the son of Lycaon answered, \"Aeneas, I take him for none other than\\nthe son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet,\\nand by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is\\nthe man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven\\'s\\nhelp, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of\\ndarkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have\\ntaken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow\\nwent through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure I should\\nsend him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I have not\\nkilled him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover I have\\nneither horse nor chariot. In my father\\'s stables there are eleven\\nexcellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths\\nspread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses,\\nchamping barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again and again\\nwhen I was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots and\\nhorses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would not\\nlisten to him; it would have been much better if I had done so, but I\\nwas thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill,\\nand I was afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might be\\nill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only\\nwith my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have\\nalready hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and\\nthough I drew blood surely enough, I have only made them still more\\nfurious. I did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day I led my\\nband of Trojans to Ilius in Hector\\'s service, and if ever I get home\\nagain to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness of my\\nhouse, may some one cut my head off then and there if I do not break\\nthe bow and set it on a hot fire--such pranks as it plays me.\"\\n\\nAeneas answered, \"Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go\\nagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of\\narms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can\\nspeed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Jove\\nagain vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely\\nback to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand\\nupon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man\\'s onset while I\\nlook after the horses.\"\\n\\n\"Aeneas,\" replied the son of Lycaon, \"take the reins and drive; if we\\nhave to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better for\\ntheir own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they expect\\nit they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. The\\nson of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses. Therefore\\ndrive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my spear.\"\\n\\nThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son of\\nTydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to Diomed,\\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes\\nspeeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful\\narcher, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is\\nAnchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us\\nretreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get\\nkilled.\"\\n\\nDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: \"Talk not of flight, for I\\nshall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight nor\\nfear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount, but\\nwill go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid of\\nno man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not take\\nboth back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart--if\\nMinerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your\\nhorses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be\\nsure you spring Aeneas\\' horses and drive them from the Trojan to the\\nAchaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros in\\npayment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and move\\nunder the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his mares to\\nthem without Laomedon\\'s knowledge, and they bore him six foals. Four\\nare still in his stables, but he gave the other two to Aeneas. We shall\\nwin great glory if we can take them.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up to\\nthem, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. \"Great and mighty son,\" said\\nhe, \"of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now try\\nwith my spear.\"\\n\\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck the\\nshield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed on\\ntill it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted out\\nand said, \"You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand out\\nfor long, and the glory of the fight is mine.\"\\n\\nBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, \"You have missed, not hit, and\\nbefore you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shall\\nglut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.\"\\n\\nWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus\\'s\\nnose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the\\nbronze point cut through the root of his tongue, coming out under his\\nchin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he fell\\nheavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he was\\nreft of life and strength.\\n\\nAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing\\nlest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion\\nin the pride of strength, with shield and spear before him and a cry of\\nbattle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare face\\nhim. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and great\\nthat as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore\\nit aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin\\nwhere the hip turns in the joint that is called the \"cup-bone.\" The\\nstone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged\\nedges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and propped\\nhimself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night\\nfell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have perished\\nthen and there, had not his mother, Jove\\'s daughter Venus, who had\\nconceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been quick to\\nmark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her dear son. She\\nprotected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest\\nsome Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.\\n\\nThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son of\\nCapaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given him. He\\nmade his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the\\nreins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas\\'s horses\\nand drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he had so\\ndone he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued\\nabove all others as the one who was most like-minded with himself, to\\ntake them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized\\nthe reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.\\n\\nNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear in\\nhand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that\\ncan lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of\\ncities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he flew\\nat her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. The\\npoint tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for\\nher, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand,\\nso that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins of the\\nblessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat\\nbread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are\\nimmortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus\\nApollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest\\nsome Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; and\\nDiomed shouted out as he left her, \"Daughter of Jove, leave war and\\nbattle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women? If\\nyou meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder at the\\nvery name of war.\"\\n\\nThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the\\nwind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all\\nbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,\\nwith his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon she\\nfell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her have\\nhis horses. \"Dear brother,\" she cried, \"save me, and give me your\\nhorses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded\\nby a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father\\nJove.\"\\n\\nThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She\\nmounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her\\nand took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew\\nforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where\\nthe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them from\\nthe chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus flung\\nherself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms about her\\nand caressed her, saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings has been\\ntreating you in this way, as though you had been doing something wrong\\nin the face of day?\"\\n\\nAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, \"Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus,\\nwounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best\\nof all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between\\nTrojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with\\nthe immortals.\"\\n\\n\"Bear it, my child,\" replied Dione, \"and make the best of it. We\\ndwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and\\nwe lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and\\nEphialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay\\nthirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then\\nperished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told\\nMercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by\\nthe severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son\\nof Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed\\narrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades,\\nwhen this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an\\narrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went\\nto the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the\\narrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon\\nhealed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for Hades was not\\nof mortal mould. Daring, head-strong, evildoer who recked not of his\\nsin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has\\negged this son of Tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for not\\nreflecting that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear his\\nchildren prattling about his knees when he returns from battle. Let,\\nthen, the son of Tydeus see that he does not have to fight with one who\\nis stronger than you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter\\nof Adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of\\nher wedded lord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with both\\nhands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But Minerva\\nand Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their mocking\\ntalk, and Minerva was first to speak. \"Father Jove,\" said she, \"do not\\nbe angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been persuading\\nsome one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so\\nvery fond, and while caressing one or other of them she must have torn\\nher delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman\\'s brooch.\"\\n\\nThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his side.\\n\"My child,\" said he, \"it has not been given you to be a warrior.\\nAttend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and\\nleave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he knew\\nhim to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the\\nmighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his\\narmour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him,\\nand thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming\\non for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him\\nwith an awful voice and said, \"Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off;\\nthink not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth\\ncannot hold their own with the immortals.\"\\n\\nThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger\\nof the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him in\\nsacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty\\nsanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold,\\nwhile Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness of\\nAeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans hacked\\nat the bucklers about one another\\'s breasts, hewing each other\\'s round\\nshields and light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to\\nMars, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, can\\nyou not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even\\nwith father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went up to\\nthe Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and afterwards\\nsprang upon me too, as though he were a god.\"\\n\\nHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars went\\nabout among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the likeness\\nof fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. \"Sons of Priam,\" said he, \"how\\nlong will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans?\\nWould you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of\\nAnchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as Hector\\nhimself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from the stress of\\nthe fight.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon\\nrebuked Hector very sternly. \"Hector,\" said he, \"where is your prowess\\nnow? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies you\\ncould hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law. I see\\nnot one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it is we,\\nyour allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar,\\neven from Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where I have left\\nmy wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy;\\nnevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground against any\\nwho would fight me though I have nothing here for the Achaeans to\\nplunder, while you look on, without even bidding your men stand firm in\\ndefence of their wives. See that you fall not into the hands of your\\nfoes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they sack your fair city\\nforthwith. Keep this before your mind night and day, and beseech the\\ncaptains of your allies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away\\ntheir reproaches from you.\"\\n\\nSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang from\\nhis chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host\\nbrandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising the\\nterrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the Achaeans,\\nbut the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven back. As\\nthe breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, when\\nmen are winnowing--while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the\\nchaff from the grain, and the chaff-heaps grow whiter and whiter--even\\nso did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses\\' hoofs raised\\nto the firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to\\nbattle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to\\nhelp the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about\\neverywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that\\nwhen he saw Pallas Minerva leave the fray he was to put courage into\\nthe hearts of the Trojans--for it was she who was helping the Danaans.\\nThen Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his\\nheart with valour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who\\nwere overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; but\\nthey could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busy\\nwith the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in\\ntheir midst.\\n\\nThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless of\\nthe fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds which\\nthe son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there is no\\nair and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds whose\\nshrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions--even so did the\\nDanaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The son of\\nAtreus went about among them and exhorted them. \"My friends,\" said he,\\n\"quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another\\'s\\neyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour more often\\nlive than get killed, but they that fly save neither life nor name.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the\\nfront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the\\nTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever\\nquick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon\\nstruck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed it\\nnot. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly, and\\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\\n\\nThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and\\nOrsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of\\nPhere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream\\nflows through the land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who\\nruled over much people and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat\\ntwin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of war.\\nThese, when they grew up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet in the\\ncause of Menelaus and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they both of\\nthem fell. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some\\nmountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle\\ntill they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two vanquished\\nby Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the ground.\\n\\nBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the\\nfront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars\\negged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas;\\nbut Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing\\nthat the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour to\\nnothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands\\nand spears against one another eager to do battle, Antilochus placed\\nhimself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back\\non seeing the two heroes side by side in front of him, so they drew the\\nbodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans and\\ncommitted the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades. They\\nthen turned back and fought in the front ranks.\\n\\nThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian\\nwarriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on\\nhis chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the\\nson of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with\\na stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell\\nfrom his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck\\nhim on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the\\nchariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and\\nshoulders buried deep in the dust--for he had fallen on sandy soil till\\nhis horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus\\nlashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.\\n\\nBut Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry\\nrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.\\nMars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil of\\nbattle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now in\\nfront of Hector and now behind him.\\n\\nDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide\\nplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river\\nrolling swiftly to the sea--he sees its boiling waters and starts back\\nin fear--even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his\\nmen, \"My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear so\\nwell? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars is with\\nhim in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore towards\\nthe Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight with\\ngods.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men, both\\nin one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in war.\\nAjax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up and\\nhurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of great\\nwealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but his\\nlot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck\\nhim in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he\\nfell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of\\nhis armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell\\nupon his shield. He planted his heel upon the body and drew out his\\nspear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could not\\nstrip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The Trojan chieftains,\\nmoreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so that\\nhe dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was, they drove\\nhim from them and he was beaten back.\\n\\nThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong hand\\nof fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both brave and\\nof great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson of\\ngreat Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke first.\\n\"Sarpedon,\" said he, \"councillor of the Lycians, why should you come\\nskulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you son of\\naegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were of old his\\nchildren. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father,\\nwho came here for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships\\nonly, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius and made a\\nwilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your people are\\nfalling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming from\\nLycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates of\\nHades vanquished by my hand.\"\\n\\nAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, \"Tlepolemus, your\\nfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon\\'s folly in refusing\\npayment to one who had served him well. He would not give your father\\nthe horses which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you\\nshall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your\\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw at\\nthe same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his\\nthroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell\\nupon his eyes. Tlepolemus\\'s spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh\\nwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone, but\\nhis father as yet warded off destruction from him.\\n\\nHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the\\nweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in such\\nhaste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing the\\nspear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile the\\nAchaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was moved\\nto pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted whether\\nto pursue the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian rank and\\nfile; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the son of Jove;\\nMinerva, therefore, turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He\\nkilled Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and\\nPrytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great Hector marked\\nhim, and sped to the front of the fight clad in his suit of mail,\\nfilling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him\\ncoming, and besought him, saying, \"Son of Priam, let me not be here to\\nfall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and since I may not return\\nhome to gladden the hearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die\\nwithin the walls of your city.\"\\n\\nHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon the\\nAchaeans and kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon away\\nand laid him beneath Jove\\'s spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his friend and\\ncomrade, drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted and a\\nmist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again, for the\\nbreath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new life, and\\nbrought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Mars\\nand Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars was\\nwith the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned\\ntowards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by Mars\\nand Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned\\ncharioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of\\nOenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great\\nwealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who\\nlived near him, owners of a fertile country.\\n\\nNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said to\\nMinerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the\\npromise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked\\nthe city of Ilius will be of no effect if we let Mars rage thus\\nfuriously. Let us go into the fray at once.\"\\n\\nMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter of\\ngreat Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with all\\nspeed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on either\\nside of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of gold,\\nimperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze, wondrous to\\nbehold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round the axle\\nupon either side. The car itself was made with plaited bands of gold\\nand silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round it. From the\\nbody of the car there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which she\\nbound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were to go under the\\nnecks of the horses Then Juno put her steeds under the yoke, eager for\\nbattle and the war-cry.\\n\\nMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with her\\nown hands, on to her father\\'s threshold, and donned the shirt of Jove,\\narming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis about her\\nshoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and on it were\\nStrife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold; moreover there\\nwas the head of the dread monster Gorgon, grim and awful to behold,\\nportent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set her helmet of gold,\\nwith four plumes, and coming to a peak both in front and behind--decked\\nwith the emblems of a hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming\\nchariot and grasped the spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, with\\nwhich she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno\\nlashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew\\nopen of their own accord--gates over which the Hours preside, in whose\\nhands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides\\nthem, or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient\\nsteeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost\\nridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the\\nson of Saturn, lord of all. \"Father Jove,\" said she, \"are you not angry\\nwith Mars for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the\\nAchaeans he has destroyed to my great grief, and without either right\\nor reason, while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their\\nease and setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I\\nhope, Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, and\\nchase him out of the battle.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more\\noften than any one else does.\"\\n\\nJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward\\nnothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see when\\nhe looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the\\nloud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they\\nreached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois and\\nScamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot.\\nShe hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up for\\nthem to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves in\\ntheir eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part where\\nthe bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed,\\nfighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance,\\nthere Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced\\nStentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together.\\n\"Argives,\" she cried; \"shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance\\nonly; as long as Achilles was fighting, if his spear was so deadly that\\nthe Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates, but\\nnow they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships.\"\\n\\nWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva\\nsprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his\\nchariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For\\nthe sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield\\nirritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up\\nthe strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke\\nof his horses and said, \"The son of Tydeus is not such another as his\\nfather. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly\\ninto the fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went all\\nunattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade\\nhim feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit\\nwhich was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the\\nCadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily\\ndid I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be\\ninstant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or you\\nare afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no\\ntrue son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.\"\\n\\nDiomed answered, \"I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove,\\nand will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart, nor\\nis there any slackness in me. I am only following your own\\ninstructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if\\nJove\\'s daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound her with my\\nspear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather\\nin this place, for I know that Mars is now lording it in the field.\"\\n\\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus,\" replied Minerva, \"man after my own heart, fear\\nneither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend you.\\nNay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear not\\nthis raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then on\\nthe other. But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying he\\nwould help the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with\\nthe Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.\"\\n\\nWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot\\non to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the\\ngoddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed. The\\noaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess and the\\nhero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight at\\nMars. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and\\nbravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his armour,\\nand Minerva donned the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her;\\nwhen, therefore, he saw Diomed, he made straight for him and let\\nPeriphas lie where he had fallen. As soon as they were at close\\nquarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke,\\nthinking to take Diomed\\'s life, but Minerva caught the spear in her\\nhand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then threw,\\nand Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars\\'s stomach where\\nhis under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing his\\nfair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as loudly\\nas nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans\\nand Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry he raised.\\n\\nAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even so\\ndid Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens. With\\nall speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great pain\\nsat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal\\nblood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying,\\n\"Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are\\ncontinually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another\\'s hands\\nwhile helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten\\nthat mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of\\nsome kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you neither\\nscold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature is\\nyour daughter. See how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent his\\nrage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian and wounded\\nher in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me too as\\nthough he were a god. Had I not run for it I must either have lain\\nthere for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpses, or have\\nbeen eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left in me.\"\\n\\nJove looked angrily at him and said, \"Do not come whining here, Sir\\nFacing-both-ways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for you\\nare ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable and\\nstubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage her,\\nand it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I cannot\\nlet you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own offspring, and\\nit was by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had been\\nthe son of any other god, you are so destructive that by this time you\\nshould have been lying lower than the Titans.\"\\n\\nHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing herbs\\nupon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As the\\njuice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though\\nit is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe\\nwashed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his seat by\\nhis father Jove all glorious to behold.\\n\\nBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put a\\nstop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house of\\nJove.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XIX\\n\\n  Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon, puts on the armour\\n  which Vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight.\\n\\nNOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\\nOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\\nships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\\nfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also of\\nhis followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came among\\nthem she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve as we may\\nwe must let this man lie, for it is by heaven\\'s will that he has\\nfallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly armour,\\nwhich no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out\\nbravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none\\ndared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\\nstill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he\\nwas glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had made\\nhim. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he\\nsaid to his mother, \"Mother, the god has given me armour, meet\\nhandiwork for an immortal and such as no-one living could have\\nfashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon\\nthe son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his\\nbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\"\\n\\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not disquieted about this\\nmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\\nflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. He\\nmay lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as\\never, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;\\nunsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might\\nand main.\"\\n\\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she then\\ndropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus, that his\\nbody might suffer no change.\\n\\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called on\\nthe Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always at\\nthe ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were\\nabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of\\nassembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so\\nlong from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus,\\ncame limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they\\ncame, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of\\nall came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of\\nAntenor had struck him with a spear in battle.\\n\\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \"Son of\\nAtreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\\nwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would have\\nbeen better, had Diana\\'s arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I\\ntook her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an Achaean the\\nless would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It\\nhas been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long\\nindeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over.\\nIf we have been angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from\\nme: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the Achaeans arm\\nforthwith that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn whether they\\nwill be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be\\nto rest his knees who may fly my spear when I wield it.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\\nhis anger.\\n\\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\\nmiddle of the assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of Mars, it\\nis well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemly\\nto interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised speaker. Who\\ncan either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest orator will be\\ndisconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do you\\nother Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken\\nto me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I that did it:\\nJove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we\\nwere assembled on the day that I took from Achilles the meed that had\\nbeen awarded to him. What could I do? All things are in the hand of\\nheaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove\\'s daughters, shuts men\\'s eyes to\\ntheir destruction. She walks delicately, not on the solid earth, but\\nhovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or to ensnare them.\\n\\n\"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest\\nwhether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on\\nthe day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair\\ncity of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, \\'Hear me, all\\ngods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day\\nshall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child\\ninto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are\\nof my blood and lineage.\\' Then said Juno all crafty and full of guile,\\n\\'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear me, O\\nOlympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day fall\\nbetween the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about\\nhim who are of your blood and lineage.\\'\\n\\n\"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,\\nto his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit\\nof Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that the\\nnoble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with child\\nand in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though there\\nwas a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and\\nkept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn,\\nand said, \\'Father Jove, lord of the lightning--I have a word for your\\near. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus\\nthe son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, that\\nhe should reign over the Argives.\\'\\n\\n\"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\\nFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again\\ninvade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then he\\nwhirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from\\nheaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he was ever\\nangry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labours\\nthat Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector\\nwas killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept\\nthinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me\\nof my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by\\nway of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people with\\nyou. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday in your\\ntents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight at\\nonce, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, that you may\\nsee whether what I give you is enough.\"\\n\\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can\\ngive such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is in\\nyour own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarry\\ntalking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do.\\nAchilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and laying\\nlow the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he\\nis fighting.\"\\n\\nThen Ulysses said, \"Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans\\nthus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be\\nno brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides\\nwith fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships,\\nfor in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle the\\nlivelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;\\nhowever much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before he\\nknows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow\\nweary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed with\\nmeat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he\\nhas routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them\\nprepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence\\nof the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied.\\nMoreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that he has never\\ngone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her after the manner\\nof men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind;\\nlet Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with a feast of\\nreconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. As for you,\\nson of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it is no\\ndisgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in\\nthe first instance.\"\\n\\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of Laertes, your words please me\\nwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\\nhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name\\nof heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain fight\\nat once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tent\\nand we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you:\\ntake some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from my tents the\\ngifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women also;\\nfurthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those that are with the\\nhost, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to the sun.\"\\n\\nThen said Achilles, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to these\\nmatters at some other season, when there is breathing time and when I\\nam calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom Hector\\nson of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain? Let the sons\\nof the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food, till we have\\navenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let them eat\\ntheir fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my tent, all hacked\\nand hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourning\\nround him. Therefore I can take thought of nothing save only slaughter\\nand blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the\\nAchaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a little,\\nbut in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater\\nknowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of\\nwhich men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is war\\'s steward, weighs the\\nupshot, it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped\\nis far heavier than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should\\nmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and\\nthreefold continually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let\\nus mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but\\nlet those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight\\nour foes more fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for\\na second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found\\nlagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose\\nthe fury of war upon the Trojans.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with Meges\\nson of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes, and\\nMelanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The word\\nwas not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out the seven\\ntripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal cauldrons\\nand the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled in useful\\narts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses weighed\\nout the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while the young\\nAchaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in the middle of\\nthe assembly.\\n\\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a god\\ncame to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which he\\nwore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting off some\\nbristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so.\\nThe other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly to hear\\nthe king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayed\\nsaying, \"I call Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, I\\ncall also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below and take\\nvengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon\\nthe girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that\\nshe has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely may heaven\\nvisit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those who perjure\\nthemselves.\"\\n\\nHe cut the boar\\'s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it\\nround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes. Then\\nAchilles also rose and said to the Argives, \"Father Jove, of a truth\\nyou blind men\\'s eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had not else\\nstirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken Briseis from\\nme against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled the destruction of\\nmany an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that we may begin fighting.\"\\n\\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\\nship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to the\\nship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men\\ndrove the horses in among the others.\\n\\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus,\\nflung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,\\nand her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she\\nwept and said, \"Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left you\\nliving; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\\nmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father and\\nmother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear\\nbrothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus,\\neven when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,\\ntold me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make Achilles\\nmarry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding\\nfeast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to me and I shall never\\ncease to grieve for you.\"\\n\\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as\\nthough their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping\\nfor her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles\\nand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"I\\npray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat\\nnor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to\\nthe going down of the sun.\"\\n\\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\\nAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\\nstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:\\nbut he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into\\nthe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\\nPatroclus. Then he said--\\n\\n\"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\\nready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting\\nto fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink in\\nmy tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I could\\nnot know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my father, who\\nis now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who am here\\nfighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake of Helen,\\nnor yet though I should hear that my son is no more--he who is being\\nbrought up in Scyros--if indeed Neoptolemus is still living. Till now I\\nmade sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away from Argos, while\\nyou were to return to Phthia, bring back my son with you in your own\\nship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the greatness of\\nmy house--for Peleus must surely be either dead, or what little life\\nremains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities of age and ever\\npresent fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my death.\"\\n\\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought\\non what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down\\nwith pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, \"My child, you have\\nquite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your\\nrecollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss of\\nhis dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner he\\nwill neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia into\\nhis breast, that he may know no hunger.\"\\n\\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\\nShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing on\\nhis broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\\nthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia\\ninto Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail\\nhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the\\nchill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen\\nblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets, the\\nbossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen spears\\nstream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the whole land was\\nradiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of their\\ntreading rose from under their feet. In the midst of them all Achilles\\nput on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,\\nfor his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus, then, full of fury\\nagainst the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the armour that\\nVulcan had made him.\\n\\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next\\nhe did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded\\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so\\ngreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon. As\\nthe light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a fire in\\ntheir homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors are\\ncarried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where they\\nwould be--even so did the gleam of Achilles\\' wondrous shield strike up\\ninto the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his\\nhead, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden plumes which\\nVulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around\\nit. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether it\\nfitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it seemed\\nto buoy him up as though it had been wings.\\n\\nHe also drew his father\\'s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\\ngreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles\\nhad strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the\\ntopmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\\nfraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied\\nthemselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast\\nabout them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back\\ntowards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the\\nhorses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as\\nthe sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his\\nfather\\'s horses saying, \"Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring of\\nPodarge--this time when we have done fighting be sure and bring your\\ndriver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him\\ndead on the plain as you did Patroclus.\"\\n\\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke--for white-armed Juno had\\nendowed him with human speech--and he bowed his head till his mane\\ntouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"Dread\\nAchilles,\" said he, \"we will indeed save you now, but the day of your\\ndeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven\\nand stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth\\nor slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his\\narmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he\\nfought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector. We two\\ncan fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of all winds;\\nnevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\\nanswered him in great sadness, saying, \"Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\\nforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\\nfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\\nshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of\\nfighting.\"\\n\\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.',\n",
       " 'Book XIV\\n\\nULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.\\n\\nUlysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the\\nwooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the\\nplace where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd, who was\\nthe most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his\\nhut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be\\nseen from far. He had made them spacious {126} and fair to see, with\\na free run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his\\nmaster\\'s absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,\\nwithout saying anything to Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them\\non top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of\\noaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside he had\\nbuilt twelve styes near one another for the sows to lie in. There were\\nfifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding sows; but the\\nboars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors\\nkept on eating them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he\\nhad continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the\\nherdsman\\'s four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always\\nwith them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of\\nsandals {127} from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out\\nherding the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth to\\ntown with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they\\nmight sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.\\n\\nWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at\\nhim, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of\\nthe stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by\\nthem in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide,\\nrushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off\\nby shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Ulysses, \"Old\\nman, the dogs were likely to have made short work of you, and then you\\nwould have got me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough\\nworries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in\\ncontinual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people\\nto eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving\\nin some distant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill\\nof bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your\\nmisfortunes.\"\\n\\nOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down.\\nHe strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of\\nthis he threw the shaggy chamois skin--a great thick one--on which he\\nused to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome,\\nand said \"May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your heart\\'s\\ndesire in return for the kind way in which you have received me.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Stranger, though a still\\npoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult him,\\nfor all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what you\\ncan get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have young\\nlords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for heaven has\\nhindered the return of him who would have been always good to me and\\ngiven me something of my own--a house, a piece of land, a good looking\\nwife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who has worked\\nhard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as they have mine\\nin the situation which I hold. If my master had grown old here he would\\nhave done great things by me, but he is gone, and I wish that Helen\\'s\\nwhole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been the death of many a\\ngood man. It was this matter that took my master to Ilius, the land of\\nnoble steeds, to fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where\\nthe young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought\\nback with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted\\nthem; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before\\nUlysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over\\nwith white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of\\nivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin.\\n\\n\"Fall to, stranger,\" said he, \"on a dish of servant\\'s pork. The fat pigs\\nhave to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; but\\nthe blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do\\nwhat is lawful and right. Even the fierce freebooters who go raiding on\\nother people\\'s land, and Jove gives them their spoil--even they,\\nwhen they have filled their ships and got home again live\\nconscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but some god\\nseems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone; they\\nwill not, therefore, go back to their own homes and make their offers of\\nmarriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force, without fear\\nor stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice not\\none victim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for he was\\nexceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland\\nis as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men put together. I will\\ntell you what he had. There are twelve herds of cattle upon the main\\nland, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs,\\nwhile his own men and hired strangers feed him twelve widely spreading\\nherds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even large flocks of goats on\\nthe far end of the island, and they are in the charge of excellent goat\\nherds. Each one of these sends the suitors the best goat in the flock\\nevery day. As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs that you see here,\\nand I have to keep picking out the best I have and sending it to them.\"\\n\\nThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously\\nwithout a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was\\nsatisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,\\nfilled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was pleased, and said\\nas he took it in his hands, \"My friend, who was this master of yours\\nthat bought you and paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell\\nme? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he\\nwas, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods\\nknow, but I may be able to give you news of him, for I have travelled\\nmuch.\"\\n\\nEumaeus answered, \"Old man, no traveller who comes here with news will\\nget Ulysses\\' wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in\\nwant of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a\\nword of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my mistress\\nand tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them,\\nand asks them all manner of questions, crying all the time as women will\\nwhen they have lost their husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt\\nand a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves\\nand birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes\\nof the sea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand\\nupon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is\\nfor all his friends--for me especially; go where I may I shall never\\nfind so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother and\\nfather where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about\\nmy parents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own\\ncountry; it is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me most; I cannot speak\\nof him without reverence though he is here no longer, for he was very\\nfond of me, and took such care of me that wherever he may be I shall\\nalways honour his memory.\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" replied Ulysses, \"you are very positive, and very hard of\\nbelief about your master\\'s coming home again, nevertheless I will not\\nmerely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything\\nfor my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and\\ncloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take\\nanything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire,\\nwho lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear by king Jove, by the\\nrites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now\\ncome, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses\\nwill return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the\\nbeginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who\\nare ill treating his wife and son.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Old man, you will neither\\nget paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink\\nyour wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. Do not keep on\\nreminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks about\\nmy honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I only\\nwish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his son\\nTelemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his; he was\\nrunning up fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse man, face\\nand figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has been\\nunsettling his mind, so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get news of\\nhis father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming\\nhome, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in\\nIthaca. But let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken, or\\nelse to escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect\\nhim. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also, for I want\\nto know, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town\\nand parents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew brought you to\\nIthaca, and from what country they professed to come--for you cannot\\nhave come by land.\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"I will tell you all about it. If there were meat\\nand wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do\\nbut to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I could easily\\ntalk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of\\nthe sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.\\n\\n\"I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man, who had many\\nsons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had\\npurchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax\\n(whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour among the\\nCretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons) put me\\non the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock. When,\\nhowever, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided his\\nestate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding\\nand little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry into a rich\\nfamily, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the field of\\nbattle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you can see\\nwhat the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and\\nMinerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the\\nenemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was\\nthe first to leap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was\\nI in battle, but I did not care about farm work, nor the frugal home\\nlife of those who would bring up children. My delight was in ships,\\nfighting, javelins, and arrows--things that most men shudder to think\\nof; but one man likes one thing and another another, and this was what\\nI was most naturally inclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy,\\nnine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign service, and I\\namassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance,\\nand much more was allotted to me later on.\\n\\n\"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans,\\nbut when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many\\nperished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to\\nTroy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing\\nso. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked the\\ncity of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it was\\nthat Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily with my\\nchildren, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of making a\\ndescent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it. I had nine\\nships, and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I and my men\\nmade feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice to the gods\\nand for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board and set sail\\nfrom Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were going down a\\nriver. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had no sickness\\non board, but sat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and\\nsteersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus;\\nthere I stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay by them and\\nkeep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every\\npoint of vantage.\\n\\n\"But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged\\nthe land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their wives and\\nchildren captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they\\nheard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was\\nfilled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of armour.\\nThen Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the\\nenemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians killed many\\nof us, and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them. Jove,\\nhowever, put it in my mind to do thus--and I wish I had died then and\\nthere in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for me--I\\ntook off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then\\nI went straight up to the king\\'s chariot, clasped his knees and kissed\\nthem, whereon he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took\\nme weeping to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and\\ntried to kill me in their fury, but the king protected me, for he feared\\nthe wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who punishes those who do\\nevil.\\n\\n\"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the\\nEgyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on\\nfor eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who\\nhad already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over\\ninto going with him to Phoenicia, where his house and his possessions\\nlay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the end of that\\ntime when months and days had gone by till the same season had come\\nround again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a pretence\\nthat I was to take a cargo along with him to that place, but really that\\nhe might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I suspected\\nhis intention, but went on board with him, for I could not help it.\\n\\n\"The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea\\nthat lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled their\\ndestruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could see\\nnothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and the\\nsea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts and\\nthe ship went round and round and was filled with fire and brimstone\\nas the lightning struck it. The men fell all into the sea; they\\nwere carried about in the water round the ship looking like so many\\nsea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting\\nhome again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship\\'s mast\\nwithin my reach, which saved my life, for I clung to it, and drifted\\nbefore the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the darkness\\nof the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian coast.\\nThere Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably without\\ncharging me anything at all--for his son found me when I was nearly dead\\nwith cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand, took me to his\\nfather\\'s house and gave me clothes to wear.\\n\\n\"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he\\nhad entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his\\nhomeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and wrought\\niron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep his family\\nfor ten generations, so much had he left in the house of king Pheidon.\\nBut the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove\\'s\\nmind from the god\\'s high oak tree, and know whether after so long an\\nabsence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the\\nking swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as\\nhe did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found,\\nthat should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before\\nUlysses returned, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing\\nfor the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge\\nof her to be sure and take me safely to King Acastus.\\n\\n\"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the\\nvery extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from land\\nthey resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt\\nand cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old\\nclouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they reached\\nthe tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a strong rope\\nfast in the ship, while they went on shore to get supper by the sea\\nside. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn my rags\\nover my head I slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck out and\\nswam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood\\nin which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and\\nwent searching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further\\nuse and went back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily,\\nthen took me to a good man\\'s door--for it seems that I am not to die yet\\nawhile.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Poor unhappy stranger, I\\nhave found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but that\\npart about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to believe\\nit. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this way? I know\\nall about the return of my master. The gods one and all of them detest\\nhim, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him die with\\nfriends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the\\nAchaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his son would have\\nbeen heir to his renown, but now the storm winds have spirited him away\\nwe know not whither.\\n\\n\"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to the\\ntown unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news\\nabout Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those who\\ngrieve over the king\\'s absence, and those who rejoice at it because they\\ncan eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I have\\nnever cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was taken in\\nby an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long way till at last\\nhe reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he had seen\\nUlysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships which had\\nbeen damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the following\\nsummer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back much wealth.\\nAnd now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has brought you to my\\ndoor, do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes. It is not\\nfor any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but only out of\\nrespect for Jove the god of hospitality, as fearing him and pitying\\nyou.\"\\n\\nUlysses answered, \"I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have\\ngiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a\\nbargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master\\ncomes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to\\nDulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he will,\\nset your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder precipice,\\nas a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling lies.\"\\n\\n\"And a pretty figure I should cut then,\" replied Eumaeus, \"both now and\\nhereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and\\nshowing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good earnest\\nif I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will come in\\ndirectly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with\\nthe pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a\\ntremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But\\nEumaeus called to his men and said, \"Bring in the best pig you have,\\nthat I may sacrifice him for this stranger, and we will take toll of him\\nourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs, while\\nothers reap the fruit of our labour.\"\\n\\nOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine\\nfat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not\\nforget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the first thing\\nhe did was to cut bristles from the pig\\'s face and throw them into the\\nfire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses might return\\nhome again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had\\nkept back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it, while the\\nothers slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and Eumaeus began\\nby putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the fat; these he\\nsprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut the rest\\nof the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them\\ntill they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they\\nthrew them on to the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most\\nequitable man, then stood up to give every one his share. He made seven\\nportions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the\\nnymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men\\nman by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin\\nas a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much pleased. \"I hope,\\nEumaeus,\" said he, \"that Jove will be as well disposed towards you as I\\nam, for the respect you are showing to an outcast like myself.\"\\n\\nTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, \"Eat, my good fellow, and\\nenjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,\\njust as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt\\nsacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering,\\nput the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own portion.\\nMesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man\\non his own account from among the Taphians during his master\\'s absence,\\nand had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either\\nto his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good\\nthings that were before them, and when they had had enough to eat and\\ndrink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all went\\nto bed after having made a hearty supper.\\n\\nNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon. It\\npoured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which is\\na wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in the\\nexcellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and give\\nit him, or make one of his men give him one. \"Listen to me,\" said he,\\n\"Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell you\\nsomething. It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will make\\neven a wise man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and dance\\nand say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as I have\\nbegun, I will go on. Would that I were still young and strong as when we\\ngot up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders,\\nbut I was in command also, for the other two would have it so. When we\\nhad come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armour\\nand lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood that grew\\nabout the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the\\nsnow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated\\nthick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept\\ncomfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I had\\ncarelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too\\ncold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When the\\nnight was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their places, I\\nnudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and he at once gave me\\nhis ear.\\n\\n\"\\'Ulysses,\\' said I, \\'this cold will be the death of me, for I have no\\ncloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt,\\nand I do not know what to do.\\'\\n\\n\"Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following\\nplan:\\n\\n\"\\'Keep still,\\' said he in a low voice, \\'or the others will hear you.\\'\\nThen he raised his head on his elbow.\\n\\n\"\\'My friends,\\' said he, \\'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We\\nare a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell\\nAgamemnon to send us up more men at once.\\'\\n\\n\"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running\\nto the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough\\ntill morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in those\\ndays, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out\\nof good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier; but now people\\nlook down upon me because my clothes are shabby.\"\\n\\nAnd Eumaeus answered, \"Old man, you have told us an excellent story,\\nand have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the\\npresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else\\nthat a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow morning\\nyou have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for we have\\nnot many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only one.\\nWhen Ulysses\\' son comes home again he will give you both cloak and\\nshirt, and send you wherever you may want to go.\"\\n\\nWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some\\ngoatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here\\nUlysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak\\nthat he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.\\n\\nThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the\\nswineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got ready\\nto go outside, and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his\\nproperty during his master\\'s absence. First he slung his sword over his\\nbrawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also\\ntook the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of\\nattack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the\\npigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from\\nthe North wind.',\n",
       " 'BOOK VIII\\n\\n  Jove forbids the gods to interfere further--There is an even\\n  fight till midday, but then Jove inclines the scales of victory\\n  in favour of the Trojans, who eventually chase the Achaeans\\n  within their wall--Juno and Minerva set out to help the\\n  Trojans: Jove sends Iris to turn them back, but later on\\n  he promises Juno that she shall have her way in the end--Hector\\'s\\n  triumph is stayed by nightfall--The Trojans bivouac on the plain.\\n\\nNOW when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse\\nlight over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmost\\ncrest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave\\near. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as\\nI am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross me,\\nbut obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an end. If\\nI see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans, he\\nshall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to Olympus; or I\\nwill hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into the deepest pit under\\nthe earth, where the gates are iron and the floor bronze, as far\\nbeneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may learn how\\nmuch the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find out for yourselves.\\nHangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it all of you,\\ngods and goddesses together--tug as you will, you will not drag Jove\\nthe supreme counsellor from heaven to earth; but were I to pull at it\\nmyself I should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, then\\nwould I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all\\ndangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above all others either of\\ngods or men.\"\\n\\nThey were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had\\nspoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, \"Father, son of\\nSaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be\\ngainsaid, but we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are\\nperishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid\\nus, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable\\nsuggestions to the Argives that they may not all of them perish in your\\ndispleasure.\"\\n\\nJove smiled at her and answered, \"Take heart, my child, Trito-born; I\\nam not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you.\"\\n\\nWith this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes of\\nglittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about the body,\\nseized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon he\\nlashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt earth\\nand starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained Ida, mother\\nof wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove and fragrant altar.\\nThere the father of gods and men stayed his horses, took them from the\\nchariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he took his seat all\\nglorious upon the topmost crests, looking down upon the city of Troy\\nand the ships of the Achaeans.\\n\\nThe Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and\\nafterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewise\\narmed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless\\neager perforce to do battle for their wives and children. All the gates\\nwere flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with the tramp\\nas of a great multitude.\\n\\nWhen they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield,\\nand spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty was the\\ndin as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another--death--cry and\\nshout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with blood.\\n\\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weapons\\nbeat against one another, and the people fell, but when the sun had\\nreached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden scales, and put\\ntwo fates of death within them, one for the Trojans and the other for\\nthe Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, and when he lifted it\\nup the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught scale of the\\nAchaeans settled down upon the ground, while that of the Trojans rose\\nheavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the glare of\\nhis lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear fell\\nupon them and they were sore afraid.\\n\\nIdomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two Ajaxes,\\nservants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerene alone\\nstood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but one of\\nhis horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had hit it\\nwith an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins to grow\\naway from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded in his\\nanguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw others\\ninto confusion. The old man instantly began cutting the traces with his\\nsword, but Hector\\'s fleet horses bore down upon him through the rout\\nwith their bold charioteer, even Hector himself, and the old man would\\nhave perished there and then had not Diomed been quick to mark, and\\nwith a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.\\n\\n\"Ulysses,\" he cried, \"noble son of Laertes where are you flying to,\\nwith your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struck with a\\nspear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend Nestor\\nfrom this man\\'s furious onset.\"\\n\\nUlysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the\\nAchaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the thick\\nof the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of Neleus.\\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"these young warriors are pressing you hard, your force\\nis spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught, and your\\nhorses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what the horses of\\nTros can do--how cleverly they can scud hither and thither over the\\nplain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from the hero Aeneas.\\nLet our squires attend to your own steeds, but let us drive mine\\nstraight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn how furiously I too can\\nwield my spear.\"\\n\\nNestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the doughty\\nsquires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor\\'s horses,\\nwhile the two both mounted Diomed\\'s chariot. Nestor took the reins in\\nhis hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up with\\nHector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was charging\\nfull speed towards them. He missed him, but struck his charioteer and\\nsquire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple while\\nthe reins were in his hands, so that he died there and then, and the\\nhorses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. Hector was greatly\\ngrieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie for all his\\nsorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his steeds\\nhave to go long without one, for he presently found brave Archeptolemus\\nthe son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind the horses, giving the\\nreins into his hand.\\n\\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have been\\npenned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men been\\nquick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just\\nin front of Diomed\\'s horses with a flare of burning brimstone. The\\nhorses were frightened and tried to back beneath the car, while the\\nreins dropped from Nestor\\'s hands. Then he was afraid and said to\\nDiomed, \"Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see you not that\\nthe hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafes victory to\\nHector; to-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grant it to\\nourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of Jove, for\\nhe is far stronger than any.\"\\n\\nDiomed answered, \"All that you have said is true; there is a grief\\nhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk among\\nthe Trojans and say, \\'The son of Tydeus fled before me to the ships.\\'\\nThis is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow me.\"\\n\\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Nestor, \"what mean you? Though Hector say that\\nyou are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him, nor\\nyet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.\"\\n\\nSo saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,\\nand with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their\\ndarts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, \"Son of Tydeus, the\\nDanaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at table,\\nthe meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.\\nHenceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than a\\nwoman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale our\\nwalls through any flinching upon my part; neither shall you carry off\\nour wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand.\"\\n\\nThe son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his horses\\nround again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice did Jove\\nthunder from the heights of Ida in token to the Trojans that he would\\nturn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted to them and said,\\n\"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be men, my\\nfriends, and fight with might and with main; I see that Jove is minded\\nto vouchsafe victory and great glory to myself, while he will deal\\ndestruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building\\nthis weak and worthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses will\\nspring lightly over their trench, and when I am at their ships forget\\nnot to bring me fire that I may burn them, while I slaughter the\\nArgives who will be all dazed and bewildered by the smoke.\"\\n\\nThen he cried to his horses, \"Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon and\\ngoodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the honey-sweet\\ncorn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has fed you, and\\nfor she has mixed wine and water for you to drink whenever you would,\\nbefore doing so even for me who am her own husband. Haste in pursuit,\\nthat we may take the shield of Nestor, the fame of which ascends to\\nheaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rods and all, and that we may\\nstrip from the shoulders of Diomed the cuirass which Vulcan made him.\\nCould we take these two things, the Achaeans would set sail in their\\nships this self-same night.\"\\n\\nThus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she shook\\nwith rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god of Neptune,\\n\"What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find no\\ncompassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you many a\\nwelcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then. If all of\\nus who are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back and keep\\nJove from helping them, he would have to sit there sulking alone on\\nIda.\"\\n\\nKing Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, \"Juno, rash of tongue,\\nwhat are you talking about? We other gods must not set ourselves\\nagainst Jove, for he is far stronger than we are.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch, from\\nthe ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and warriors, who\\nwere pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that the hand of Jove\\nwas with him. He would even have set fire to the ships and burned them,\\nhad not Queen Juno put it into the mind of Agamemnon, to bestir himself\\nand to encourage the Achaeans. To this end he went round the ships and\\ntents carrying a great purple cloak, and took his stand by the huge\\nblack hull of Ulysses\\' ship, which was middlemost of all; it was from\\nthis place that his voice would carry farthest, on the one hand towards\\nthe tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other towards those of\\nAchilles--for these two heroes, well assured of their own strength, had\\nvalorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the line. From this\\nspot then, with a voice that could be heard afar, he shouted to the\\nDanaans, saying, \"Argives, shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in\\nsemblance only; where are now our vaunts that we should prove\\nvictorious--the vaunts we made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate\\nthe flesh of horned cattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? You\\nvowed that you would each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred\\nmen, and now you prove no match even for one--for Hector, who will be\\nere long setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever so\\nruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? Yet, when to\\nmy sorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship pass your altars\\nwithout offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every one of\\nthem, so eager was I to sack the city of Troy. Vouchsafe me then this\\nprayer--suffer us to escape at any rate with our lives, and let not the\\nAchaeans be so utterly vanquished by the Trojans.\"\\n\\nThus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him that\\nhis people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle, most\\nunfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its talons;\\nthe eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the Achaeans\\nsacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; when, therefore, the people saw\\nthat the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely upon the\\nTrojans and fought more boldly.\\n\\nThere was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that he\\nhad driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight sooner\\nthan the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he slew an\\narmed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon. He had\\nturned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the back\\nmidway between his shoulders and went right through his chest, and his\\narmour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his chariot.\\n\\nAfter him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two Ajaxes\\nclothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his companion in\\narms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus the brave son of\\nEuaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his place under cover\\nof the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax lifted his shield\\nTeucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng, the\\nman would fall dead; then Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child to\\nits mother, and again duck down under his shield.\\n\\nWhich of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and then\\nOrmenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike Lycophontes,\\nAmopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. All these in turn did he lay\\nlow upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw him making\\nhavoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him and said,\\n\"Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain among the\\nhost, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory\\nof your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care of you in his\\nown house when you were a child, bastard though you were. Cover him\\nwith glory though he is far off; I will promise and I will assuredly\\nperform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me to sack the city of\\nIlius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after my own--a\\ntripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who shall go up\\ninto your bed.\"\\n\\nAnd Teucer answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge me;\\nfrom the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have never\\nceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and\\nkill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buried\\nin the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was bent\\non hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit Priam\\'s\\nbrave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair Castianeira,\\nlovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, and now he bowed his\\nhead as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed down by showers\\nin spring--even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight of his\\nhelmet.\\n\\nAgain he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again his\\narrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector\\'s brave\\ncharioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he was\\ndriving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as he fell\\nheadlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him. Hector\\nwas greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for all his\\nsorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother Cebriones,\\nwho was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he had said. Hector\\nthereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to the ground, and\\nseizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intent to kill him.\\nTeucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid it upon the\\nbow-string, but Hector struck him with the jagged stone as he was\\ntaking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit him just\\nwhere the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, a very deadly\\nplace, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his wrist was less, and\\nthe bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward on his knees. Ajax saw\\nthat his brother had fallen, and running towards him bestrode him and\\nsheltered him with his shield. Meanwhile his two trusty squires,\\nMecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, came up and bore him to the ships\\ngroaning in his great pain.\\n\\nJove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the Achaeans\\nto their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their head. As a\\nhound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he gives him\\nchase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did Hector follow\\nclose upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as they rushed\\npanic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set stakes and\\ntrench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the hands of the Trojans,\\nthey halted at their ships, calling upon one another and praying every\\nman instantly as they lifted up their hands to the gods; but Hector\\nwheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring like those of\\nGorgo or murderous Mars.\\n\\nJuno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to Minerva,\\n\"Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take no more\\nthought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever do\\nso? See how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of but a\\nsingle man. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury, and\\nhas already done great mischief.\"\\n\\nMinerva answered, \"Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his own\\nland, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is mad\\nwith spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets\\nhow often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labours\\nEurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up to\\nheaven, and then Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the\\nsense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of\\nHades, to fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come\\nback alive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates\\nme, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed his knees and\\ntook hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do honour to\\nAchilles. I shall know what to do next time he begins calling me his\\ngrey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go within the house of\\naegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we shall then find out whether\\nPriam\\'s son Hector will be glad to meet us in the highways of battle,\\nor whether the Trojans will glut hounds and vultures with the fat of\\ntheir flesh as they be dead by the ships of the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nThus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,\\nobeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened steeds,\\nwhile Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her richly vesture,\\nmade with her own hands, on to the threshold of her father, and donned\\nthe shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle. Then she stepped into her\\nflaming chariot, and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and strong\\nwith which she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno\\nlashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open\\nof their own accord--gates over which the Hours preside, in whose hands\\nare heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them\\nor to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds.\\n\\nBut father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent\\nwinged Iris with a message to them. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, turn\\nthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to\\nfighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this is what I\\nmean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them from\\ntheir chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them all ten\\nyears to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them; my\\ngrey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her father\\nmeans. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say she\\nalways contradicts me.\"\\n\\nWith this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights of Ida\\nto the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the outer\\ngates of its many valleys and gave them her message. \"What,\" said she,\\n\"are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbids going. This is\\nwhat he says, and this is what he means to do, he will lame your horses for\\nyou, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break it in pieces.\\nIt will take you all ten years to heal the wounds his lightning will\\ninflict upon you, that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess, what\\nquarrelling with your father means. He is less hurt and angry with\\nJuno, for whatever he says she always contradicts him but you, bold\\nhussy, will you really dare to raise your huge spear in defiance of\\nJove?\"\\n\\nWith this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, \"Of a truth, child\\nof aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men\\'s battles further in\\ndefiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have it, and let\\nJove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans and Danaans according to\\nhis own pleasure.\"\\n\\nShe turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them fast\\nto their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the end wall\\nof the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon their golden\\nthrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were very angry.\\n\\nPresently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered the\\nassembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horses\\nfor him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. Jove\\nthen sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath him.\\nMinerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spoke nor\\nasked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said, \"Minerva\\nand Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing so many\\nof your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might\\nof my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were both\\nof you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its terrible\\ndoings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been--I should\\nhave struck you with lightning, and your chariots would never have\\nbrought you back again to Olympus.\"\\n\\nMinerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and brooded\\nmischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word, for she\\nwas in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her father; but\\nJuno could not contain herself and said, \"What, dread son of Saturn,\\nare you talking about? We know how great your power is, nevertheless we\\nhave compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are perishing and coming\\nto a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain from\\nactual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to the\\nArgives, that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\"\\n\\nAnd Jove answered, \"To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,\\nyou will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of the Argives,\\nfor fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the son\\nof Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships\\' sterns\\nabout the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is how it is decreed;\\nfor aught I care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath earth and\\nsea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus with neither ray\\nof light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go on and on till\\nyou get there, and I shall not care one whit for your displeasure; you\\nare the greatest vixen living.\"\\n\\nJuno made him no answer. The sun\\'s glorious orb now sank into Oceanus\\nand drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the Trojans when\\nlight failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness fall\\nupon the Achaeans.\\n\\nThen Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a council on\\nthe open space near the river, where there was a spot clear of corpses.\\nThey left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speech\\nhe made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze point\\nof which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the spear-head\\nwas of gold. Spear in hand he spoke. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"Trojans,\\nDardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I should destroy the\\nships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back to Ilius, but\\ndarkness came on too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their\\nships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey the behests of\\nnight, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots\\nand give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep and\\ncattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your horses and\\ngather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires whose\\nflare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try to fly beyond the\\nsea by night, and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested; many\\na man among them must take a dart with him to nurse at home, hit with\\nspear or arrow as he is leaping on board his ship, that others may fear\\nto bring war and weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the heralds\\ntell it about the city that the growing youths and grey-bearded men are\\nto camp upon its heaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a\\ngreat fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be\\nentered by surprise while the host is outside. See to it, brave\\nTrojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the moment; at\\ndaybreak I will instruct you further. I pray in hope to Jove and to the\\ngods that we may then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for\\n\\'tis the fates that have borne them and their ships hither. This night,\\ntherefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning let us put on our\\narmour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall then\\nknow whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus will drive me back from the\\nships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carry off his\\nbloodstained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle, abide my spear\\nif he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be among the first to\\nfall and many another of his comrades round him. Would that I were as\\nsure of being immortal and never growing old, and of being worshipped\\nlike Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this day will bring evil to the\\nArgives.\"\\n\\nThus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took their\\nsweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each by his own\\nchariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the city, they\\nbrought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered much wood.\\nThey then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals, and the wind\\ncarried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven--but the blessed gods\\npartook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Ilius with Priam and\\nPriam\\'s people. Thus high in hope they sat through the livelong night\\nby the highways of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle. As when\\nthe stars shine clear, and the moon is bright--there is not a breath of\\nair, not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it stands out in the\\nineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of heaven; the stars can\\nall of them be told and the heart of the shepherd is glad--even thus\\nshone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilius midway between the\\nships and the river Xanthus. A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the\\nplain, and in the glow of each there sat fifty men, while the horses,\\nchamping oats and corn beside their chariots, waited till dawn should\\ncome.',\n",
       " 'BOOK XV\\n\\n  Jove awakes, tells Apollo to heal Hector, and the Trojans\\n  again become victorious.\\n\\nBUT when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set\\nstakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojans\\nmade a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear. Jove\\nnow woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying with golden-throned\\nJuno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw the Trojans and\\nAchaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others driving them\\npell-mell before them with King Neptune in their midst. He saw Hector\\nlying on the ground with his comrades gathered round him, gasping for\\nbreath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, for it was not the\\nfeeblest of the Achaeans who struck him.\\n\\nThe sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on Juno.\\n\"I see, Juno,\" said he, \"you mischief-making trickster, that your\\ncunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout of his\\nhost. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will be the\\nfirst to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not remember\\nhow once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two anvils on to your\\nfeet, and bound your hands in a chain of gold which none might break,\\nand you hung in mid-air among the clouds. All the gods in Olympus were\\nin a fury, but they could not reach you to set you free; when I caught\\nany one of them I gripped him and hurled him from the heavenly\\nthreshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even this did not\\nrelieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which I felt about noble\\nHercules whom you and Boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond the seas to\\nCos, after suborning the tempests; but I rescued him, and\\nnotwithstanding all his mighty labours I brought him back again to\\nArgos. I would remind you of this that you may learn to leave off being\\nso deceitful, and discover how much you are likely to gain by the\\nembraces out of which you have come here to trick me.\"\\n\\nJuno trembled as he spoke, and said, \"May heaven above and earth below\\nbe my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx--and this is the\\nmost solemn oath that a blessed god can take--nay, I swear also by your\\nown almighty head and by our bridal bed--things over which I could\\nnever possibly perjure myself--that Neptune is not punishing Hector and\\nthe Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing of mine; it is\\nall of his own mere motion because he was sorry to see the Achaeans\\nhard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him, I should tell him\\nto do as you bid him.\"\\n\\nThe sire of gods and men smiled and answered, \"If you, Juno, were\\nalways to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune, like\\nit or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking. If,\\nthen, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among the\\nrank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the bow,\\nthat I want them--Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and tell\\nNeptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he may send\\nHector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he will thus\\nforget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back in confusion\\ntill they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus. Achilles will\\nthen send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and Hector will kill him\\nin front of Ilius after he has slain many warriors, and among them my\\nown noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill Hector to avenge Patroclus,\\nand from that time I will bring it about that the Achaeans shall\\npersistently drive the Trojans back till they fulfil the counsels of\\nMinerva and take Ilius. But I will not stay my anger, nor permit any\\ngod to help the Danaans till I have accomplished the desire of the son\\nof Peleus, according to the promise I made by bowing my head on the day\\nwhen Thetis touched my knees and besought me to give him honour.\"\\n\\nJuno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great\\nOlympus. Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vast\\ncontinents, and he says to himself, \"Now I will be here, or there,\" and\\nhe would have all manner of things--even so swiftly did Juno wing her\\nway till she came to high Olympus and went in among the gods who were\\ngathered in the house of Jove. When they saw her they all of them came\\nup to her, and held out their cups to her by way of greeting. She let\\nthe others be, but took the cup offered her by lovely Themis, who was\\nfirst to come running up to her. \"Juno,\" said she, \"why are you here?\\nAnd you seem troubled--has your husband the son of Saturn been\\nfrightening you?\"\\n\\nAnd Juno answered, \"Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what a\\nproud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to table,\\nwhere you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs which he\\nhas avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will be angered by them,\\nhowever peaceably he may be feasting now.\"\\n\\nOn this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the house\\nof Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with care,\\nand she spoke up in a rage. \"Fools that we are,\" she cried, \"to be thus\\nmadly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up to him and stay him\\nby force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and cares for nobody, for\\nhe knows that he is much stronger than any other of the immortals. Make\\nthe best, therefore, of whatever ills he may choose to send each one of\\nyou; Mars, I take it, has had a taste of them already, for his son\\nAscalaphus has fallen in battle--the man whom of all others he loved\\nmost dearly and whose father he owns himself to be.\"\\n\\nWhen he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat of\\nhis hands, and said in anger, \"Do not blame me, you gods that dwell in\\nheaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death of my\\nson, even though it end in my being struck by Jove\\'s lightning and\\nlying in blood and dust among the corpses.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout, while he\\nput on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused to still more\\nfierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals, had not\\nMinerva, alarmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her seat and\\nhurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and the shield from\\nhis shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from his strong hand and\\nset it on one side; then she said to Mars, \"Madman, you are undone; you\\nhave ears that hear not, or you have lost all judgement and\\nunderstanding; have you not heard what Juno has said on coming straight\\nfrom the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish to go through all kinds\\nof suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to Olympus,\\nafter having caused infinite mischief to all us others? Jove would\\ninstantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves; he would come\\nto Olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one after another, guilty\\nor not guilty. Therefore lay aside your anger for the death of your\\nson; better men than he have either been killed already or will fall\\nhereafter, and one cannot protect every one\\'s whole family.\"\\n\\nWith these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno called\\nApollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. \"Jove,\" she said\\nto them, \"desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; when you have\\nseen him you are to do as he may then bid you.\"\\n\\nThereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris and\\nApollo made all haste on their way. When they reached many-fountained\\nIda, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seated on topmost Gargarus\\nwith a fragrant cloud encircling his head as with a diadem. They stood\\nbefore his presence, and he was pleased with them for having been so\\nquick in obeying the orders his wife had given them.\\n\\nHe spoke to Iris first. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, tell King Neptune\\nwhat I now bid you--and tell him true. Bid him leave off fighting, and\\neither join the company of the gods, or go down into the sea. If he\\ntakes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider well whether he is\\nstrong enough to hold his own against me if I attack him. I am older\\nand much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid to set himself up as\\non a level with myself, of whom all the other gods stand in awe.\"\\n\\nIris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or snowflakes\\nthat fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas, even so did\\nshe wing her way till she came close up to the great shaker of the\\nearth. Then she said, \"I have come, O dark-haired king that holds the\\nworld in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove. He bids you\\nleave off fighting, and either join the company of the gods or go down\\ninto the sea; if, however, you take no heed and disobey him, he says he\\nwill come down here and fight you. He would have you keep out of his\\nreach, for he is older and much stronger than you are, and yet you are\\nnot afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself, of whom all\\nthe other gods stand in awe.\"\\n\\nNeptune was very angry and said, \"Great heavens! strong as Jove may be,\\nhe has said more than he can do if he has threatened violence against\\nme, who am of like honour with himself. We were three brothers whom\\nRhea bore to Saturn--Jove, myself, and Hades who rules the world below.\\nHeaven and earth were divided into three parts, and each of us was to\\nhave an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell to me to have my\\ndwelling in the sea for evermore; Hades took the darkness of the realms\\nunder the earth, while air and sky and clouds were the portion that\\nfell to Jove; but earth and great Olympus are the common property of\\nall. Therefore I will not walk as Jove would have me. For all his\\nstrength, let him keep to his own third share and be contented without\\nthreatening to lay hands upon me as though I were nobody. Let him keep\\nhis bragging talk for his own sons and daughters, who must perforce\\nobey him.\"\\n\\nIris fleet as the wind then answered, \"Am I really, Neptune, to take\\nthis daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsider your\\nanswer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know that the\\nErinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person.\"\\n\\nNeptune answered, \"Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in season.\\nIt is well when a messenger shows so much discretion. Nevertheless it\\ncuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke so angrily another\\nwho is his own peer, and of like empire with himself. Now, however, I\\nwill give way in spite of my displeasure; furthermore let me tell you,\\nand I mean what I say--if contrary to the desire of myself, Minerva\\ndriver of the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King Vulcan, Jove spares steep\\nIlius, and will not let the Achaeans have the great triumph of sacking\\nit, let him understand that he will incur our implacable resentment.\"\\n\\nNeptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely did the\\nAchaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, \"Go, dear Phoebus, to\\nHector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has now gone\\ndown under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure. Had he not\\ndone so those gods who are below with Saturn would have come to hear of\\nthe fight between us. It is better for both of us that he should have\\ncurbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for I should have had much\\ntrouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis, and shake it\\nfuriously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic; take, moreover,\\nbrave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and rouse him to deeds\\nof daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back to their ships and to\\nthe Hellespont. From that point I will think it well over, how the\\nAchaeans may have a respite from their troubles.\"\\n\\nApollo obeyed his father\\'s saying, and left the crests of Ida, flying\\nlike a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He found Hector\\nno longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he had just come\\nto himself again. He knew those who were about him, and the sweat and\\nhard breathing had left him from the moment when the will of\\naegis-bearing Jove had revived him. Apollo stood beside him and said,\\n\"Hector son of Priam, why are you so faint, and why are you here away\\nfrom the others? Has any mishap befallen you?\"\\n\\nHector in a weak voice answered, \"And which, kind sir, of the gods are\\nyou, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me on the\\nchest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships of the\\nAchaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure that this\\nvery day I should breathe my last and go down into the house of Hades.\"\\n\\nThen King Apollo said to him, \"Take heart; the son of Saturn has sent\\nyou a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, even me,\\nPhoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian hitherto not\\nonly of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore, order your horsemen\\nto drive their chariots to the ships in great multitudes. I will go\\nbefore your horses to smooth the way for them, and will turn the\\nAchaeans in flight.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his people.\\nAnd as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallops\\ngloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to take his\\nbath in the river--he tosses his head, and his mane streams over his\\nshoulders as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to\\nthe pastures where the mares are feeding--even so Hector, when he heard\\nwhat the god said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward as fast as\\nhis limbs could take him. As country peasants set their hounds on to a\\nhomed stag or wild goat--he has taken shelter under rock or thicket,\\nand they cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shouts\\nhave roused stands in their path, and they are in no further humour for\\nthe chase--even so the Achaeans were still charging on in a body, using\\ntheir swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they saw Hector\\ngoing about among his men they were afraid, and their hearts fell down\\ninto their feet.\\n\\nThen spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man who\\ncould throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,\\nwhile few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided. He\\nthen with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: \"What, in\\nheaven\\'s name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again? Every\\none made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but it seems\\nthat one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killed many of us\\nDanaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the hand of Jove\\nmust be with him or he would never dare show himself so masterful in\\nthe forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say;\\nlet us order the main body of our forces to fall back upon the ships,\\nbut let those of us who profess to be the flower of the army stand\\nfirm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back at the point of our\\nspears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive that he will then think\\nbetter of it before he tries to charge into the press of the Danaans.\"\\n\\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who were\\nabout Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of Teucer,\\nMeriones, and Meges peer of Mars called all their best men about them\\nand sustained the fight against Hector and the Trojans, but the main\\nbody fell back upon the ships of the Achaeans.\\n\\nThe Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding on at\\ntheir head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloud about his\\nshoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with its shaggy fringe,\\nwhich Vulcan the smith had given Jove to strike terror into the hearts\\nof men. With this in his hand he led on the Trojans.\\n\\nThe Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of battle\\nrose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the bowstrings.\\nMany a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the bodies of many\\na valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway, before they could\\ntaste of man\\'s fair flesh and glut themselves with blood. So long as\\nPhoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and without shaking it, the\\nweapons on either side took effect and the people fell, but when he\\nshook it straight in the face of the Danaans and raised his mighty\\nbattle-cry their hearts fainted within them and they forgot their\\nformer prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in the dead of night on\\na herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman is not\\nthere--even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for Apollo filled them\\nwith panic and gave victory to Hector and the Trojans.\\n\\nThe fight then became more scattered and they killed one another where\\nthey best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one, leader\\nof the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of Menestheus.\\nAeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard son to Oileus, and\\nbrother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own country, for\\nhe had killed a man, a kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom Oileus\\nhad married. Iasus had become a leader of the Athenians, and was son of\\nSphelus the son of Boucolos. Polydamas killed Mecisteus, and Polites\\nEchius, in the front of the battle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris\\nstruck Deiochus from behind in the lower part of the shoulder, as he\\nwas flying among the foremost, and the point of the spear went clean\\nthrough him.\\n\\nWhile they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the Achaeans\\nwere flying pell-mell to the trench and the set stakes, and were forced\\nback within their wall. Hector then cried out to the Trojans, \"Forward\\nto the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see any man keeping back on\\nthe other side the wall away from the ships I will have him killed: his\\nkinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire, but dogs\\nshall tear him in pieces in front of our city.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he laid his whip about his horses\\' shoulders and called to\\nthe Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted with a cry that\\nrent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with his own. Phoebus\\nApollo went before, and kicked down the banks of the deep trench into\\nits middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as broad as the throw of\\na spear when a man is trying his strength. The Trojan battalions poured\\nover the bridge, and Apollo with his redoubtable aegis led the way. He\\nkicked down the wall of the Achaeans as easily as a child who playing\\non the sea-shore has built a house of sand and then kicks it down again\\nand destroys it--even so did you, O Apollo, shed toil and trouble upon\\nthe Argives, filling them with panic and confusion.\\n\\nThus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out to\\none another and raising their hands with loud cries every man to\\nheaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted up\\nhis hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently\\nthan any of them. \"Father Jove,\" said he, \"if ever any one in\\nwheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer and\\nprayed that he might return safely home, whereon you bowed your head to\\nhim in assent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans to\\ntriumph thus over the Achaeans.\"\\n\\nAll-counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to the prayer of the\\naged son of Neleus. When they heard Jove thunder they flung themselves\\nyet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking over the bulwarks\\nof a ship when the sea runs high before a gale--for it is the force of\\nthe wind that makes the waves so great--even so did the Trojans spring\\nover the wall with a shout, and drive their chariots onwards. The two\\nsides fought with their double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand\\nencounter-the Trojans from their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing up\\ninto their ships and wielding the long pikes that were lying on the\\ndecks ready for use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod with bronze.\\n\\nNow Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting about\\nthe wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships, remained sitting\\nin the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him with his conversation\\nand spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain. When, however, he\\nsaw the Trojans swarming through the breach in the wall, while the\\nAchaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, he cried aloud, and\\nsmote his two thighs with the flat of his hands. \"Eurypylus,\" said he\\nin his dismay, \"I know you want me badly, but I cannot stay with you\\nany longer, for there is hard fighting going on; a servant shall take\\ncare of you now, for I must make all speed to Achilles, and induce him\\nto fight if I can; who knows but with heaven\\'s help I may persuade him.\\nA man does well to listen to the advice of a friend.\"\\n\\nWhen he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm and\\nresisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer in\\nnumber, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither could\\nthe Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among the\\ntents and ships. As a carpenter\\'s line gives a true edge to a piece of\\nship\\'s timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva has\\ninstructed in all kinds of useful arts--even so level was the issue of\\nthe fight between the two sides, as they fought some round one and some\\nround another.\\n\\nHector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about the\\nsame ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor yet\\ncould Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought him.\\n\\nThen Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear as he\\nwas bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the ground and\\nthe torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen in\\nfront of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,\\n\"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a jot,\\nbut rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of his armour\\nnow that he has fallen.\"\\n\\nHe then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit Lycophron a\\nfollower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was living with Ajax\\ninasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans. Hector\\'s spear\\nstruck him on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from the\\nship\\'s prow on to the ground with no life left in him. Ajax shook with\\nrage and said to his brother, \"Teucer, my good fellow, our trusty\\ncomrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came to live with us from\\nCythera and whom we honoured as much as our own parents. Hector has\\njust killed him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which\\nPhoebus Apollo gave you.\"\\n\\nTeucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver in\\nhis hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and hit\\nCleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son of\\nPanthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to his\\nhorses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,\\ndoing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now come\\nupon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avert it,\\nfor the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from his\\nchariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside. King\\nPolydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up to the\\nhorses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon, and ordered\\nhim to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He then went back\\nand took his place in the front ranks.\\n\\nTeucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have been no\\nmore fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him then and\\nthere: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyes on\\nTeucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring for\\nhim just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim; on this the\\narrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands. Teucer shook with\\nanger and said to his brother, \"Alas, see how heaven thwarts us in all\\nwe do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand,\\nthough I strung it this selfsame morning that it might serve me for\\nmany an arrow.\"\\n\\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \"My good fellow, let your bow and your\\narrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite the\\nDanaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both\\nfight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may be\\nsuccessful for the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find it\\na hard matter to take the ships.\"\\n\\nTeucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield\\nfour hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set his\\nhelmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\\nabove it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and forthwith\\nhe was by the side of Ajax.\\n\\nWhen Hector saw that Teucer\\'s bow was of no more use to him, he shouted\\nout to the Trojans and Lycians, \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good\\nin close fight, be men, my friends, and show your mettle here at the\\nships, for I see the weapon of one of their chieftains made useless by\\nthe hand of Jove. It is easy to see when Jove is helping people and\\nmeans to help them still further, or again when he is bringing them\\ndown and will do nothing for them; he is now on our side, and is going\\nagainst the Argives. Therefore swarm round the ships and fight. If any\\nof you is struck by spear or sword and loses his life, let him die; he\\ndies with honour who dies fighting for his country; and he will leave\\nhis wife and children safe behind him, with his house and allotment\\nunplundered if only the Achaeans can be driven back to their own land,\\nthey and their ships.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the other\\nside exhorted his comrades saying, \"Shame on you Argives, we are now\\nutterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the enemy from\\nour ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you will be able to\\nget home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on his whole host to\\nfire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they are not at a dance\\nbut in battle? Our only course is to fight them with might and main; we\\nhad better chance it, life or death, once for all, than fight long and\\nwithout issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than ourselves.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then killed\\nSchedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajax killed\\nLaodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamas killed\\nOtus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of the proud\\nEpeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but Polydamas crouched\\ndown, and he missed him, for Apollo would not suffer the son of\\nPanthous to fall in battle; but the spear hit Croesmus in the middle of\\nhis chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped\\nhim of his armour. At that moment the valiant soldier Dolops son of\\nLampus sprang upon Lampus was son of Laomedon and noted for his valour,\\nwhile his son Dolops was versed in all the ways of war. He then struck\\nthe middle of the son of Phyleus\\' shield with his spear, setting on him\\nat close quarters, but his good corslet made with plates of metal saved\\nhim; Phyleus had brought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where\\nhis host, King Euphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect\\nhim. It now served to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck the\\ntopmost crest of Dolops\\'s bronze helmet with his spear and tore away\\nits plume of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet as it was\\nit tumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting and\\nconfident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got by the\\nside of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder, from\\nbehind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into his\\nchest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him to strip\\nhim of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers for help, and\\nhe especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon, who erewhile\\nused to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before the war broke\\nout; but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went back to Ilius,\\nwhere he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priam who\\ntreated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him and said,\\n\"Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note of the death\\nof your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying to take\\nDolops\\'s armour? Follow me; there must be no fighting the Argives from\\na distance now, but we must do so in close combat till either we kill\\nthem or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her people.\"\\n\\nHe led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after.\\nMeanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. \"My\\nfriends,\" he cried, \"be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves in\\nbattle so as to win respect from one another. Men who respect each\\nother\\'s good opinion are less likely to be killed than those who do\\nnot, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory.\"\\n\\nThus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back the\\nTrojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with a\\nwall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of the loud\\nbattle-cry urged Antilochus on. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"you are young\\nand there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more valiant\\nthan you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and kill him.\"\\n\\nHe hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once darted\\nout from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking carefully\\nround him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart did not\\nspeed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippus the proud\\nson of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming forward,\\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the\\nground. Antilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn which a\\nhunter has hit as it was breaking away from its covert, and killed it.\\nEven so, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus spring upon you to strip\\nyou of your armour; but noble Hector marked him, and came running up to\\nhim through the thick of the battle. Antilochus, brave soldier though\\nhe was, would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage creature\\nwhich knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed a dog or a\\nman who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can be gathered to\\nattack it. Even so did the son of Nestor fly, and the Trojans and\\nHector with a cry that rent the air showered their weapons after him;\\nnor did he turn round and stay his flight till he had reached his\\ncomrades.\\n\\nThe Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the ships\\nin fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them on to new\\ndeeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argives and\\ndefeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving glory to\\nHector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the ships, till he\\nhad fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had made him; Jove,\\ntherefore, bided his time till he should see the glare of a blazing\\nship. From that hour he was about so to order that the Trojans should\\nbe driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory to the Achaeans.\\nWith this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam, who was eager enough\\nalready, to assail the ships. His fury was as that of Mars, or as when\\na fire is raging in the glades of some dense forest upon the mountains;\\nhe foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under his terrible eye-brows,\\nand his helmet quivered on his temples by reason of the fury with which\\nhe fought. Jove from heaven was with him, and though he was but one\\nagainst many, vouchsafed him victory and glory; for he was doomed to an\\nearly death, and already Pallas Minerva was hurrying on the hour of his\\ndestruction at the hands of the son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept\\ntrying to break the ranks of the enemy wherever he could see them\\nthickest, and in the goodliest armour; but do what he might he could\\nnot break through them, for they stood as a tower foursquare, or as\\nsome high cliff rising from the grey sea that braves the anger of the\\ngale, and of the waves that thunder up against it. He fell upon them\\nlike flames of fire from every quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain\\nhigh by wind and storm, breaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam,\\nthe fierce winds roar against the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail\\nthem for fear, and they are saved but by a very little from\\ndestruction--even so were the hearts of the Achaeans fainting within\\nthem. Or as a savage lion attacking a herd of cows while they are\\nfeeding by thousands in the low-lying meadows by some wide-watered\\nshore--the herdsman is at his wit\\'s end how to protect his herd and\\nkeeps going about now in the van and now in the rear of his cattle,\\nwhile the lion springs into the thick of them and fastens on a cow so\\nthat they all tremble for fear--even so were the Achaeans utterly\\npanic-stricken by Hector and father Jove. Nevertheless Hector only\\nkilled Periphetes of Mycenae; he was son of Copreus who was wont to\\ntake the orders of King Eurystheus to mighty Hercules, but the son was\\na far better man than the father in every way; he was fleet of foot, a\\nvaliant warrior, and in understanding ranked among the foremost men of\\nMycenae. He it was who then afforded Hector a triumph, for as he was\\nturning back he stumbled against the rim of his shield which reached\\nhis feet, and served to keep the javelins off him. He tripped against\\nthis and fell face upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as\\nhe did so. Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a\\nspear into his chest, and killed him close to his own comrades. These,\\nfor all their sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves\\nterribly afraid of Hector.\\n\\nThey had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had been\\ndrawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans came pouring\\nafter them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of ships,\\nbut they made a stand by their tents without being broken up and\\nscattered; shame and fear restrained them. They kept shouting\\nincessantly to one another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to\\nthe Achaeans, was loudest in imploring every man by his parents, and\\nbeseeching him to stand firm.\\n\\n\"Be men, my friends,\" he cried, \"and respect one another\\'s good\\nopinion. Think, all of you, on your children, your wives, your\\nproperty, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On their\\nbehalf though they are not here, I implore you to stand firm, and not\\nto turn in flight.\"\\n\\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva lifted\\nthe thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon\\nthem, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight was\\nraging. They could see Hector and all his men, both those in the rear\\nwho were taking no part in the battle, and those who were fighting by\\nthe ships.\\n\\nAjax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but strode\\nfrom deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve cubits long\\nand jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of horsemanship\\ncouples four horses together and comes tearing full speed along the\\npublic way from the country into some large town--many both men and\\nwomen marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time changing his\\nhorse, springing from one to another without ever missing his feet\\nwhile the horses are at a gallop--even so did Ajax go striding from one\\nship\\'s deck to another, and his voice went up into the heavens. He kept\\non shouting his orders to the Danaans and exhorting them to defend\\ntheir ships and tents; neither did Hector remain within the main body\\nof the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle swoops down upon a flock of\\nwild-fowl feeding near a river--geese, it may be, or cranes, or\\nlong-necked swans--even so did Hector make straight for a dark-prowed\\nship, rushing right towards it; for Jove with his mighty hand impelled\\nhim forward, and roused his people to follow him.\\n\\nAnd now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would have\\nthought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely did\\nthey fight; and this was the mind in which they were--the Achaeans did\\nnot believe they should escape destruction but thought themselves\\ndoomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat high with the\\nhope of firing the ships and putting the Achaean heroes to the sword.\\n\\nThus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of the\\ngood ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore him back\\nto his native land. Round this ship there raged a close hand-to-hand\\nfight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fight at a distance\\nwith bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at one another in\\nclose combat with their mighty swords and spears pointed at both ends;\\nthey fought moreover with keen battle-axes and with hatchets. Many a\\ngood stout blade hilted and scabbarded with iron, fell from hand or\\nshoulder as they fought, and the earth ran red with blood. Hector, when\\nhe had seized the ship, would not loose his hold but held on to its\\ncurved stern and shouted to the Trojans, \"Bring fire, and raise the\\nbattle-cry all of you with a single voice. Now has Jove vouchsafed us a\\nday that will pay us for all the rest; this day we shall take the ships\\nwhich came hither against heaven\\'s will, and which have caused us such\\ninfinite suffering through the cowardice of our councillors, who when I\\nwould have done battle at the ships held me back and forbade the host\\nto follow me; if Jove did then indeed warp our judgements, himself now\\ncommands me and cheers me on.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the Achaeans,\\nand Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome by the darts\\nthat were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed. Therefore he\\nleft the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to the\\nseven-foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out, and\\nwith his spear held back any Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the\\nships. All the time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice and\\nexhorting the Danaans. \"My friends,\" he cried, \"Danaan heroes, servants\\nof Mars, be men my friends, and fight with might and with main. Can we\\nhope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely than\\nthe one we have? There is no strong city within reach, whence we may\\ndraw fresh forces to turn the scales in our favour. We are on the plain\\nof the armed Trojans with the sea behind us, and far from our own\\ncountry.

       " 'Book VII\\n\\nRECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.\\n\\nThus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the\\ntown. When she reached her father\\'s house she drew up at the gateway,\\nand her brothers--comely as the gods--gathered round her, took the mules\\nout of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she\\nwent to her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit\\nthe fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,\\nand had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over the\\nPhaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god. {57}\\nShe had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and\\nbrought her supper for her into her own room.\\n\\nPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a\\nthick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud Phaeacians\\nwho met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he\\nwas just entering the town, she came towards him in the likeness of a\\nlittle girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front of him, and\\nUlysses said:\\n\\n\"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?\\nI am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know one in your\\ntown and country.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva said, \"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you\\nwant, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before\\nyou and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not look\\nat any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide\\nstrangers, and do not like men who come from some other place. They are\\na sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships\\nthat glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air.\"\\n\\nOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one\\nof the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the\\nmidst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards\\nhim had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their\\nharbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,\\nwhich, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when\\nthey reached the king\\'s house Minerva said:\\n\\n\"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.\\nYou will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do not be\\nafraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to\\ncarry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her\\nname is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband Alcinous.\\nThey both descend originally from Neptune, who was father to Nausithous\\nby Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the youngest daughter\\nof Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but he ruined his\\nill-fated people and lost his own life to boot.\\n\\n\"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the\\ngreat Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two\\nsons Rhexenor and Alcinous; {58} Apollo killed the first of them while\\nhe was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter\\nArete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no other woman is honoured\\nof all those that keep house along with their husbands.\\n\\n\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her\\nchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look upon\\nher as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for\\nshe is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any\\nwomen are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle\\ntheir disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope\\nof seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to your home and\\ncountry.\"\\n\\nThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to\\nMarathon {59} and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered\\nthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,\\nand he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold\\nof bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or\\nmoon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the\\ncornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of\\nsilver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and\\nthe hook of the door was of gold.\\n\\nOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with\\nhis consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the\\npalace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old.\\nSeats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end to the\\nother, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house\\nhad made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit and eat\\nand drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden\\nfigures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on\\npedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table. There are\\n{60} fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always grinding\\nrich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and\\nspin, and their shuttles go backwards and forwards like the fluttering\\nof aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it will turn\\noil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so their women\\nexcel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them all manner of\\nuseful arts, and they are very intelligent.\\n\\nOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of\\nabout four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful\\ntrees--pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are\\nluscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor\\nfail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so\\nsoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on\\npear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for\\nthere is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,\\nthe grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being\\ngathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on\\nhave shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again\\nare just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are\\nbeautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year\\nround. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout the\\nwhole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the outer\\ncourt to the house itself, and the town\\'s people draw water from it.\\nSuch, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the\\nhouse of king Alcinous.\\n\\nSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he\\nhad looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the\\nprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the\\nPhaeacians making their drink offerings to Mercury, which they always\\ndid the last thing before going away for the night. {61} He went\\nstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness\\nin which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King\\nAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at\\nthat moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became\\nvisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,\\nbut Ulysses began at once with his petition.\\n\\n\"Queen Arete,\" he exclaimed, \"daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress\\nI humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests (whom may\\nheaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they leave their\\npossessions to their children, and all the honours conferred upon them\\nby the state) to help me home to my own country as soon as possible; for\\nI have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\"\\n\\nThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their\\npeace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an excellent\\nspeaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\\naddressed them thus:\\n\\n\"Alcinous,\" said he, \"it is not creditable to you that a stranger should\\nbe seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting to\\nhear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat\\non a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and\\nwater that we may make a drink offering to Jove the lord of thunder,\\nwho takes all well disposed suppliants under his protection; and let\\nthe housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever there may be in the\\nhouse.\"\\n\\nWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from\\nthe hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting\\nbeside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then brought him\\nwater in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for\\nhim to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper\\nservant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there\\nwas in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous said to one\\nof the servants, \"Pontonous, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that\\nwe may make drink-offerings to Jove the lord of thunder, who is the\\nprotector of all well-disposed suppliants.\"\\n\\nPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving\\nevery man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and\\nhad drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:\\n\\n\"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You\\nhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall\\ninvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial\\nbanquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his\\nescort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his\\nown country without trouble or inconvenience to himself, no matter how\\ndistant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his\\nhomeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take\\nthe luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is\\npossible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who\\nhas come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods\\nare departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made\\nthemselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them\\nhecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,\\nand if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other\\nof them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the\\ngods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\" {62}\\n\\nThen Ulysses said: \"Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into\\nyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body\\nnor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.\\nIndeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me,\\nyou would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,\\nlet me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very\\nimportunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man\\'s notice no matter how\\ndire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I shall\\neat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only\\non the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose,\\nand at break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content\\nto die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all\\nthe greatness of my house.\" {63}\\n\\nThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he\\nshould have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when\\nthey had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he\\nwas minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving\\nUlysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were\\ntaking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak,\\nfor she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses\\nwas wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,\\n\"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should like\\nto ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes? Did\\nyou not say you had come here from beyond the sea?\"\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"It would be a long story Madam, were I to relate\\nin full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid\\nheavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island far away\\nin the sea which is called \\'the Ogygian.\\' Here dwells the cunning and\\npowerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far\\nfrom all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however, brought me to\\nher hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my ship with his\\nthunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were\\ndrowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried\\nhither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the\\ndarkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island\\nwhere the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me\\nwith the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that I\\nmight never grow old, but she could not persuade me to let her do so.\\n\\n\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered the good\\nclothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at last\\nwhen the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free will,\\neither because Jove had told her she must, or because she had changed\\nher mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she provisioned\\nwith abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good stout\\nclothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days seven\\nand ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught sight of\\nthe first outlines of the mountains upon your coast--and glad indeed was\\nI to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much trouble in\\nstore for me, for at this point Neptune would let me go no further, and\\nraised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I\\ncould no longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of\\nthe gale, and I had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to\\nyour shores.\\n\\n\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the\\nwaves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam\\non till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place, for\\nthere were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I\\ngot out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was\\ncoming on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered\\nmyself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a\\nvery deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all\\nnight, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun\\nwas westering, and saw your daughter\\'s maid servants playing upon the\\nbeach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I besought\\nher aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so\\nthan could be expected from so young a person--for young people are apt\\nto be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she\\nhad had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you\\nsee me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have told\\nyou the whole truth.\"\\n\\nThen Alcinous said, \"Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to\\nbring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing that she\\nwas the first person whose aid you asked.\"\\n\\n\"Pray do not scold her,\" replied Ulysses; \"she is not to blame. She did\\ntell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid,\\nfor I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human\\nbeing is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.\"\\n\\n\"Stranger,\" replied Alcinous, \"I am not the kind of man to get angry\\nabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father Jove,\\nMinerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are, and how\\nmuch you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter,\\nand become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a house and\\nan estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your\\nown wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend tomorrow to the\\nmatter of your escort. You can sleep {64} during the whole voyage if you\\nlike, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own\\nhome, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further\\noff than Euboea, which those of my people who saw it when they took\\nyellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is the\\nfurthest of any place--and yet they did the whole voyage in a single day\\nwithout distressing themselves, and came back again afterwards. You\\nwill thus see how much my ships excel all others, and what magnificent\\noarsmen my sailors are.\"\\n\\nThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, \"Father Jove, grant that\\nAlcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an imperishable\\nname among mankind, and at the same time I shall return to my country.\"\\n\\nThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the\\nroom that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to\\nspread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to\\nwear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when\\nthey had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said, \"Rise, sir\\nstranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,\" and glad indeed was\\nhe to go to his rest.\\n\\nSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway; but\\nAlcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his wife by\\nhis side.',\n",
       " 'Book IX\\n\\nULYSSES DECLARES HIMSELF AND BEGINS HIS STORY---THE CICONS, LOTOPHAGI,\\nAND CYCLOPES.\\n\\n\\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a bard\\nwith such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or\\nmore delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the\\nguests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded with bread\\nand meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every\\nman. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however,\\nsince you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my\\nown sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor yet\\nhow to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has been\\nlaid heavily upon me.\\n\\n\"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it, and\\none day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though I\\nlive so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes, renowned\\namong mankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my fame ascends to\\nheaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain called Neritum,\\ncovered with forests; and not far from it there is a group of islands\\nvery near to one another--Dulichium, Same, and the wooded island of\\nZacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest up in the sea\\ntowards the sunset, while the others lie away from it towards dawn. {75}\\nIt is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my eyes know none\\nthat they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her\\nin her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean\\ngoddess Circe; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there\\nis nothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, and\\nhowever splendid a home he may have in a foreign country, if it be far\\nfrom father or mother, he does not care about it. Now, however, I will\\ntell you of the many hazardous adventures which by Jove\\'s will I met\\nwith on my return from Troy.\\n\\n\"When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which is\\nthe city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people to\\nthe sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we divided\\nequitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I\\nthen said that we had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly\\nwould not obey me, so they staid there drinking much wine and killing\\ngreat numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Cicons\\ncried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were more in\\nnumber, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of war,\\nfor they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the occasion\\nserved; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as leaves and\\nbloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us, so that we were\\nhard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships, and the hosts\\naimed their bronze-shod spears at one another. {76} So long as the day\\nwaxed and it was still morning, we held our own against them, though\\nthey were more in number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the\\ntime when men loose their oxen, the Cicons got the better of us, and we\\nlost half a dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those\\nthat were left.\\n\\n\"Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have\\nescaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till we\\nhad thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by the\\nhands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it\\nblew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and\\nnight sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the\\ngale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters, so we took\\nthem down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the land.\\nThere we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from toil and\\ndistress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we again raised\\nour masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and steersmen\\ndirect our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed had not\\nthe North wind and the currents been against me as I was doubling Cape\\nMalea, and set me off my course hard by the island of Cythera.\\n\\n\"I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the\\nsea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who\\nlive on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take\\nin fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near\\nthe ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my company to\\nsee what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had\\na third man under them. They started at once, and went about among the\\nLotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of the lotus,\\nwhich was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about\\nhome, and did not even want to go back and say what had happened to\\nthem, but were for staying and munching lotus {77} with the Lotus-eaters\\nwithout thinking further of their return; nevertheless, though they wept\\nbitterly I forced them back to the ships and made them fast under the\\nbenches. Then I told the rest to go on board at once, lest any of them\\nshould taste of the lotus and leave off wanting to get home, so they\\ntook their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.\\n\\n\"We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the land of\\nthe lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant nor\\nplough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and\\ngrapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes\\nyield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no\\nlaws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of\\nhigh mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and they take no\\naccount of their neighbours.\\n\\n\"Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite\\nclose to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is over-run\\nwith wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never\\ndisturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen--who as a rule will suffer so\\nmuch hardship in forest or among mountain precipices--do not go there,\\nnor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness\\nuntilled and unsown from year to year, and has no living thing upon it\\nbut only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who\\ncould make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city,\\nor sail over the sea to one another\\'s country as people who have ships\\ncan do; if they had had these they would have colonised the island, {78}\\nfor it is a very good one, and would yield everything in due season.\\nThere are meadows that in some places come right down to the sea\\nshore, well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do there\\nexcellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would always\\nyield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is deep. There is a good\\nharbour where no cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be\\nmoored, but all one has to do is to beach one\\'s vessel and stay there\\ntill the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of\\nthe harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and\\nthere are poplars growing all round it.\\n\\n\"Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must have\\nbrought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist\\nhung all round our ships; {79} the moon was hidden behind a mass of\\nclouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked for\\nit, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore before\\nwe found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had beached\\nthe ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped upon the beach\\ntill daybreak.\\n\\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we admired\\nthe island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove\\'s daughters\\nroused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On\\nthis we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and\\ndividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven\\nsent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got\\nnine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to\\nthe going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, and we had plenty\\nof wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we sacked\\nthe city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out. While we were\\nfeasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the Cyclopes,\\nwhich was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires. We could\\nalmost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their sheep and\\ngoats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped down\\nupon the beach, and next morning I called a council.\\n\\n\"\\'Stay here, my brave fellows,\\' said I, \\'all the rest of you, while I go\\nwith my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if they are\\nuncivilised savages, or a hospitable and humane race.\\'\\n\\n\"I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers; so\\nthey took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars. When we\\ngot to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff near\\nthe sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a station for\\na great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large yard, with\\na high wall round it made of stones built into the ground and of trees\\nboth pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster who was then\\naway from home shepherding his flocks. He would have nothing to do with\\nother people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature,\\nnot like a human being at all, but resembling rather some crag that\\nstands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high mountain.\\n\\n\"I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all\\nbut the twelve best among them, who were to go along with myself. I also\\ntook a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by Maron,\\nson of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron god of Ismarus, and\\nlived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we were sacking\\nthe city we respected him, and spared his life, as also his wife and\\nchild; so he made me some presents of great value--seven talents of fine\\ngold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet wine, unblended,\\nand of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid in the house knew\\nabout it, but only himself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank\\nit he mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance\\nfrom the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain\\nfrom drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet\\nfull of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to\\ndeal with some savage who would be of great strength, and would respect\\nneither right nor law.\\n\\n\"We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went inside\\nand took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were loaded\\nwith cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold.\\nThey were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets, then\\nthe oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones {80} all\\nkept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels, bowls,\\nand milk pails into which he milked, were swimming with whey. When they\\nsaw all this, my men begged me to let them first steal some cheeses, and\\nmake off with them to the ship; they would then return, drive down the\\nlambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with them. It would have\\nbeen indeed better if we had done so but I would not listen to them, for\\nI wanted to see the owner himself, in the hope that he might give me\\na present. When, however, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal\\nwith.\\n\\n\"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others\\nof them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his\\nsheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood\\nto light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise on\\nto the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far end\\nof the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as the\\nshe-goats that he was going to milk, leaving the males, both rams and\\nhe-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the mouth\\nof the cave--so huge that two and twenty strong four-wheeled waggons\\nwould not be enough to draw it from its place against the doorway. When\\nhe had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due\\ncourse, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half\\nthe milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the other half he\\npoured into bowls that he might drink it for his supper. When he had got\\nthrough with all his work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us,\\nwhereon he said:\\n\\n\"\\'Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do\\nyou sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every\\nman\\'s hand against you?\\'\\n\\n\"We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous\\nform, but I managed to say, \\'We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,\\nbut by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far\\nout of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who\\nhas won infinite renown throughout the whole world, by sacking so great\\na city and killing so many people. We therefore humbly pray you to show\\nus some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors may\\nreasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven, for we\\nare your suppliants, and Jove takes all respectable travellers under his\\nprotection, for he is the avenger of all suppliants and foreigners in\\ndistress.\\'\\n\\n\"To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, \\'Stranger,\\' said he, \\'you are\\na fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me, indeed,\\nabout fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do not care\\nabout Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so much stronger\\nthan they. I shall not spare either yourself or your companions out of\\nany regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for doing so. And now\\ntell me where you made your ship fast when you came on shore. Was it\\nround the point, or is she lying straight off the land?\\'\\n\\n\"He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught in that\\nway, so I answered with a lie; \\'Neptune,\\' said I, \\'sent my ship on to\\nthe rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were driven\\non to them from the open sea, but I and those who are with me escaped\\nthe jaws of death.\\'\\n\\n\"The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a\\nsudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down\\nupon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed\\nupon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore\\nthem limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a lion\\nin the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving\\nanything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to heaven\\non seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to do; but\\nwhen the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed down his\\nmeal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched himself\\nfull length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep. I was at\\nfirst inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals,\\nbut I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be lost, for we\\nshould never be able to shift the stone which the monster had put in\\nfront of the door. So we stayed sobbing and sighing where we were till\\nmorning came.\\n\\n\"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit\\nhis fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let\\neach have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his\\nwork, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them for his\\nmorning\\'s meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone\\naway from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back\\nagain--as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a\\nquiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried\\n\\'Shoo, shoo,\\' after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I was\\nleft to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself with\\nglory.\\n\\n\"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows: The\\nCyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;\\nit was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for\\na staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could\\nonly compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large\\nburden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club\\nand cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and\\ntold them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do,\\nand lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire\\nto make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was\\nlying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of\\nthem should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the\\nmonster\\'s eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom\\nI should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch\\ncame back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into the cave--this\\ntime driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I\\nsuppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him\\nto do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the\\ndoor, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and\\nthen let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all\\nthis work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off\\nthem. So I went up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my\\nhands:\\n\\n\"\\'Look here, Cyclops,\\' said I, you have been eating a great deal of\\nman\\'s flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what\\nkind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a\\ndrink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and\\nfurther me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping and\\nraving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed of yourself; how can\\nyou expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this\\nway?\\'\\n\\n\"He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of\\nthe wine that he begged me for another bowl full. \\'Be so kind,\\' he said,\\n\\'as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want to make\\nyou a present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even in this\\ncountry, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but this\\ndrinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.\\'\\n\\n\"I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him, and\\nthree times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I saw\\nthat the wine had got into his head, I said to him as plausibly as\\nI could: \\'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me,\\ntherefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what\\nmy father and mother and my friends have always called me.\\'\\n\\n\"But the cruel wretch said, \\'Then I will eat all Noman\\'s comrades before\\nNoman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the present\\nthat I will make him.\\'\\n\\n\"As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.\\nHis great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon\\nhim. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of\\nhuman flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I\\nthrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged\\nmy men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green\\nthough it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing\\nwith heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had filled their\\nhearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam into the\\nmonster\\'s eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning it\\nround and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship\\'s plank with an\\nauger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long\\nas they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye,\\ntill the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and\\nround, so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids\\nand eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a\\nblacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper it--for\\nit is this that gives strength to the iron--and it makes a great hiss as\\nhe does so, even thus did the Cyclops\\' eye hiss round the beam of olive\\nwood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a\\nfright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye,\\nand hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did\\nso to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him;\\nso they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him\\ncrying, and asked what was the matter with him.\\n\\n\"\\'What ails you, Polyphemus,\\' said they, \\'that you make such a noise,\\nbreaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able\\nto sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is\\ntrying to kill you either by fraud or by force?\\'\\n\\n\"But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, \\'Noman is killing\\nme by fraud; no man is killing me by force.\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Then,\\' said they, \\'if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when\\nJove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray\\nto your father Neptune.\\'\\n\\n\"Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my clever\\nstratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about\\nwith his hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then\\nhe sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch\\nanyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be foolish\\nenough to attempt this.\\n\\n\"As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own\\nlife and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who knows\\nthat his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In the\\nend I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were well\\ngrown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in\\nthrees together, with some of the withies on which the wicked monster\\nused to sleep. There was to be a man under the middle sheep, and the two\\non either side were to cover him, so that there were three sheep to each\\nman. As for myself there was a ram finer than any of the others, so I\\ncaught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in the thick wool under\\nhis belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a\\nfirm hold on it all the time.\\n\\n\"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but\\nwhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep\\nhurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens\\nwaiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their\\nmaster in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they\\nstood upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were\\nunderneath their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy\\nwith its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self, Polyphemus laid\\nhold of it and said:\\n\\n\"\\'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this\\nmorning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the\\nmob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the\\nfirst to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it\\nbecause you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because\\nthat wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and\\nblinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and\\ntalk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash his\\nbrains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should thus\\nhave some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done me.\\'\\n\\n\"As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way\\nout from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram\\'s belly,\\nand then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by\\nconstantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them\\ndown to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who\\nhad escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed.\\nHowever, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to\\nhush their crying, and told them to get all the sheep on board at once\\nand put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their places, and smote\\nthe grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my\\nvoice would reach, I began to jeer at the Cyclops.\\n\\n\"\\'Cyclops,\\' said I, \\'you should have taken better measure of your man\\nbefore eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your\\nvisitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would\\nfind you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.\\'\\n\\n\"He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top from\\noff a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so that\\nit was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. {81} The sea\\nquaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised\\ncarried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore.\\nBut I snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my\\nmen by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they\\nlaid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I\\nwas for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of\\nme to hold my tongue.\\n\\n\"\\'Do not,\\' they exclaimed, \\'be mad enough to provoke this savage\\ncreature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us\\nback again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death\\nof us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have\\npounded our heads and our ship\\'s timbers into a jelly with the rugged\\nrocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.\\'\\n\\n\"But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my rage,\\n\\'Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and\\nspoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of\\nLaertes, who lives in Ithaca.\\'\\n\\n\"On this he groaned, and cried out, \\'Alas, alas, then the old prophecy\\nabout me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a man\\nboth brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, who was an\\nexcellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he\\ngrew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day, and said\\nI should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all along\\nexpecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength, whereas\\nhe turns out to be a little insignificant weakling, who has managed to\\nblind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come here, then,\\nUlysses, that I may make you presents to show my hospitality, and urge\\nNeptune to help you forward on your journey--for Neptune and I are\\nfather and son. He, if he so will, shall heal me, which no one else\\nneither god nor man can do.\\'\\n\\n\"Then I said, \\'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and\\nsending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more\\nthan Neptune to cure that eye of yours.\\'\\n\\n\"On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed,\\nsaying, \\'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten\\nson, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must\\nget back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight\\nafter losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man\\'s ship\\nand find trouble in his house.\\'] {82}\\n\\n\"Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up\\na rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with\\nprodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a\\nlittle of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell\\ninto it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way\\ntowards the shore of the island.\\n\\n\"When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our\\nships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our\\nreturn. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the\\nsea shore; we also landed the Cyclops\\' sheep, and divided them equitably\\namongst us so that none might have reason to complain. As for the ram,\\nmy companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share; so I\\nsacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to Jove, who\\nis the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only thought how\\nhe might destroy both my ships and my comrades.\\n\\n\"Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted\\nour fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on\\ndark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning rosy-fingered\\nDawn appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they\\ntook their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so we sailed\\non with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we\\nhad lost our comrades.']"
